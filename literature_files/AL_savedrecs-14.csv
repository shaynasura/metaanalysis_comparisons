We studied the effects of gully erosion on carbon and nitrogen storage in surface soil/sediment and herbaceous vegetation and on C and N mineralization in a headwater catchment used for cattle grazing. We found significantly lower C and N stored in an incising gully compared with an intact valley. This storage was significantly higher in an adjacent stabilizing gully, although not to the levels found in the intact valley. The intact valley had two to four times higher soil/sediment concentrations of total organic C, total N and Colwell extractable P than the incising gully. Lower storage was not explained by differences in vegetation biomass density or silt and clay content. Vegetation accounted for only 8% of C and 2% of N storage. Although not a significant store in itself, vegetation has an important indirect role in restoring and maintaining soil/sediment C and N stocks in eroding areas. We found significant linear relationships between C and N mineralization rates and soil/sediment C and N content, with lower rates occurring in the eroded sediment. These findings support our initial hypothesis that gully erosion reduces C and N storage and mineralization rates in eroding catchments. The implications of this study include a change to the quality of eroded sediments in headwater catchments, causing C-poorer and N-poorer sediments to be exported but overall loads to increase.

The shape of the cut heads is similar to those which the Japanese common squid, Todarodes pacificus, discarded when it was the predator of the Sardine or the Achovy in the tank.

The heads of the Sardine and the Anchovy were mainly preyed on by the Brown Hakeling from July to November. The ranges of body length back-calculated from the head length, were 101 to 129 mm in the Anchovy and 140 to 214 mm in the Sardine.

The simple exemption formula is often used as a criterion for the purpose of screening air pollutants. That is, the exemption formula is used for air quality review and to determine whether a facility applying for and described in a new, modified, or revised air quality plan is exempted from further air quality review. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) air quality regulations are used to regulate air emissions and air pollutants released from the oil and gas facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. If a facility is not exempt after completing the air quality review, a refined air quality modeling will be required to regulate the air pollutants. However, at present, the scientific basis for BOEM's exemption formula is not available to the author. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide the theoretical framework and justification for the use of BOEM's exemption formula. In this paper, several exemption formulas have been derived from the Gaussian and non-Gaussian dispersion models; the Gaussian dispersion model is a special case of non-Gaussian dispersion model. The dispersion parameters obtained from the tracer experiments in the Gulf of Mexico are used in the dispersion models. In this paper, the dispersion parameters used in the dispersion models are also derived from the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. In particular, it has been shown that the total amount of emissions from the facility for each air pollutant calculated using BOEM's exemption formula is conservative.Implications:The operation of offshore oil and gas facilities under BOEM's jurisdiction is required to comply with the BOEM's regulations. BOEM's air quality regulations are used to regulate air emissions and air pollutants released from the oil and gas facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. The exemption formulas have been used by BOEM and other regulatory agencies as a screening tool to regulate air emissions emitted from the oil and gas and other industries. Because of the BOEM's regulatory responsibility, it is important to establish the scientific basis and provide the justification for the exemption formulas. The methodology developed here could also be adopted and used by other regulatory agencies.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1096-2247,2162-2906,,,,,,,,,,"Gulf Mexico Outer Continental Shelf Reg, Bur Ocean Energy Management, New Orleans, LA 70123 USA",Gulf Mexico Outer Continental Shelf Reg,,,2015-03-25,WOS:000350138800013,25947131,

Thermal properties of gas hydrate-bearing sediments directly govern the heat transfer process during hydrate decomposition which couples with phase transitions and multiphase flows. Latest database on the thermal properties of natural sediments containing gas hydrates still remains limited. Here we report on point heat source measurements of the effective thermal conductivity of hydrate-bearing sediments through a thermistor-based method and evaluation of existing models. Effective thermal conductivity of water saturated natural sediments and partially saturated hydrate-sediment are obtained, showing a significant effect of compaction on the effective thermal conductivity of the sediments. The evolution of thermal conductivity during hydrate formation, decomposition and reformation indicates that the variation of the components in the pores could play a crucial role in the effective thermal conductivity. A higher saturation of hydrates in the pores and a smaller porosity could contribute to a better thermal conductivity. The evolution of the effective thermal conductivity with hydrate formation and decomposition also demonstrates a temperature dependence. Moreover, the reformation process after hydrates are fully decomposed significantly impacts the variation of the effective thermal conductivity, which could be attributed to the solution migration during decomposition and the local inhomogeneity of hydrate reformation. The slightly increase in the thermal conductivity below zero degree Celsius implies the small fraction of ice generation during the cooling process. The results could provide some insights into the effect of hydrate formation and decomposition on the effective thermal conductivity of natural sediments, which would be helpful in the heat transfer evaluation and gas production simulation in the field test.

These deposits are of great importance for engineering applications such as mineral extraction and oil and gas exploration, and for understanding the processes that have governed the oceans throughout Earth's history. However, the formation and structure of these large salt deposits are at present poorly understood. Today, the Dead Sea is the only deep lake in the world in which salt crystals form and create a growing deposit on the seafloor. This dynamic environment provides a unique natural laboratory for exploring the multiphase transport processes with phase change that create such salt deposits. This project will undertake a comprehensive investigation that combines an extensive field campaign by the Geological Survey of Israel with detailed large-scale computer simulations and theoretical analysis at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The research will train US engineering and geology students in the interdisciplinary areas of environmental model development, computational multiphase fluid dynamics, and large-scale simulations on parallel computer architectures. Student exchanges will take place between UCSB and the Dead Sea Observatory, and the investigators will hold lecture series at both institutions. An international workshop on the physical transport processes governing the Dead Sea is planned. This project will explore and quantify the nonlinear interplay of the convective and diffusive transport of heat and salt. The project will explore how this transport is modulated by (1) phase change between dissolved and crystalline salt within the lake; (2) radiative heating/cooling, evaporation/salt rejection and wind stresses at the lake's surface; and (3) inflow of freshwater, sediment and/or brine. The governing dimensionless parameters will be identified, along with the quantitative ranges that apply to the Dead Sea, and the respective balances that govern the dynamics. In this way, the project will obtain quantitatively accurate scaling laws for these processes, and enable predictions for the evolution of the Dead Sea under a variety of different environmental forcings. Results will provide a predictive tool for managing water resources and useful information for advancing technologies related to mining and hydrocarbon exploration. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1936258,,,,,,,,University of California-Santa Barbara,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15125446,,

The macabre events that followed the wrecking saw more than 100 individuals murdered over a three-month period by mutineers attempting to establish control of the surviving crew and passengers. The mutineers, however, never realised their ultimate objective of hijacking the anticipated rescue ship, and most were instead duly executed in the Abrolhos. Cultural and physical material directly associated with the Batavia mutiny has since been recovered, primarily from Beacon Island, which was the focal area of the mutinous attempts to establish control. Between 1960 and 1964, four individual burials were recovered on Beacon Island; a further six individuals were recovered from a multiple grave that was excavated in stages between 1994 and 2001. The focus of the present study, however, is to briefly describe the skeletal remains of the multiple burial individuals only, including their demographics (sex, age and stature) and descriptions of potential palaeopathology (trauma, nutritional deficiencies and disease). Osteological analyses indicated an unbalanced sex ratio in favour of males; the age at death distribution ranges from about 8 months to no older than 3549 years. It appears that prior to their untimely demise, the multiple burial individuals were mostly healthy, with relatively little evidence of disease, illness or ante-mortem trauma.

To combat climate change and ocean acidification as a result of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, efforts have already been put forth to capture and sequester CO2 from large point sources, especially power plants; however, the utilization of CO2 as a feedstock to make valuable chemicals, materials, and transportation fuels is potentially more desirable and provides a better and long-term solution than sequestration. The products of CO2 utilization can supplement or replace chemical feedstocks in the fine chemicals, pharmaceutical, and polymer industries. In this review, we first provide an overview of the current status of CO2-capture technologies and their associated challenges and opportunities with respect to efficiency and economy followed by an overview of various carbon-utilization approaches. The current status of combined CO2 capture and utilization, as a novel efficient and cost-effective approach, is also briefly discussed.

During the period from September to December 2014, the CO2CRC in collaboration with Callide Oxyfuel Services Pty Ltd conducted a series of CO2 injection tests into the Paaratte formation (Otway Basin, Victoria, Australia) utilizing product CO2 (near food grade) and product CO2 with added impurities (nominal SO2: 67 ppmv, O-2: 6150 ppmv and NOx: 9 ppmv) from the Callide Oxyfuel Project. The purpose of the injection testing was to assess the geochemical effect of the CO2 injected with water on the siliciclastic reservoir. The geochemical test, which was designed and conducted by CO2CRC, consists of water production, Test 1 (injection of CO2-saturated water without impurities), and Test 2 (injection of CO2-saturated water with impurities). In this paper, 2-D radial reactive transport simulations of injection tests were carried out using TOUGHREACT, including: (1) simulation of the pre-injection period from Otway Stage 2B Test in 2011 to the start of the geochemical test; (2) simulations of the pure CO2 and the impure CO2 cases; (3) long-term simulation of the impure CO2 case; and (4) simulations of injection of CO2-saturated water with various impurity concentrations. The numerical model was able to reproduce the observed geochemical changes during the geochemical test. The results indicate that there were negligible differences between the pure CO2 and the impure CO2 cases for both changes in water chemistry and mineralogy, if SO2 or O-2 was less than 1000 ppmv. Based on this evaluation of both field test results and simulations, by extrapolation it is concluded that co-injection of impurity gases (up to 1000 ppmv SO2 and 1000 ppmv O-2) with CO2 would have insignificant impacts on the reservoir at the Otway site. In the long-term simulation, the distribution area of residual gas in the reservoir was small and the pH of the formation water was near neutral after 1000 years. Moreover, it was predicted that the water disturbed by CO2 impurities would come close to the initial geochemical conditions in the long-term, and that it is highly probable that the long-term impact after 1000 years would become much less compared to the short-term impact in the test period. The method and model presented here was suitable for the Otway site test and would be applicable to other CO2 storage sites with similar conditions.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,0,10,,,1750-5836,1878-0148,,,,,,,,,,"Elect Power Dev Co Ltd, Thermal Power Engn Dept, Chuo Ku, 15-1 Ginza,6 Chome, Tokyo 1048165, JapanJilin Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Groundwater Resources & Environm, 2519 Jiefang St, Changchun 130021, Jilin, Peoples R ChinaNittetsu Min Consultants Co Ltd, Minato Ku, NMF Shiba Bldg,2-3 Shiba 4 Chome, Tokyo 1080014, Japan",Elect Power Dev Co LtdNittetsu Min Consultants Co Ltd,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000414258300015,,

Over the last decade, it has also become one of the world's fastest-growing economies; today, it is the world's seventh largest economy and plays a substantial role in the international oil and gas production market. The recent discovery of the huge amount of petroleum in the oceanic pre-salt layer can position Brazil as the world's fourth largest petroleum producer by 2030. As a result, the country is facing the challenge of finding a non-predatory development strategy for the sector, especially one that will protect the coastal environments and local communities. The Brazilian system of royalties, initially thought to counteract negative impacts, has encountered social and governmental disapproval, and has subjected the communities affected by the oil findings to considerable uncertainty and increased disputes over the fairness of the returns from the use of this resource. Both national and international experiences have shown that when mismanaged, royalties from oil production create an economy that is heavily dependent on oil, and often lead to fiscal inefficiency and corruption. These effects happen because government ownership of the oil resources alone does not guarantee social and economic development or higher quality of life for local people; this part of the population is generally the group that is harmed by the activities. The key is in defining the implementation and management frameworks for the efficient utilization of oil resources. The development of the Brazilian oil industry should account for the fact that these activities are predominantly carried out in the coastal zone, a region whose ecological and economic relevance was recognized by the Brazilian Constitution of 1988, which gave it the status of a national heritage site. This study discusses Brazilian practices in royalty management and compares them to international experiences in terms of legal, social and economical aspects. We also provide a historical summary of the use of oil resources in Brazil, advocating for responsible utilization that includes obligatory compensation for social or environmental impacts on coastal and oceanic zones.

The presence of geochemical markers, such as n-alkanes, steranes, pentacyclic triterpenoids, and alkyl PAHs, their distribution types, and values of their ratios indicates the predominating source of organic fossil fuels and products of their refining rather than from the natural Antarctic environment. Fossil fuel-originated compounds well survived in conditions of Antarctic climate over long times thus enabling to characterize geochemical features of source fossil fuel identified as petroleum expelled from kerogen II of algal/bacterial origins deposited in sub-oxic conditions and being in the middle of catagenesis. Both microbial activity and water leaching play an important role in degradation of terrestrial oil spills in the Antarctica climate, and petroleum alteration occurs lowly over long periods of time.

Boring surveys using a hand-operated peat sampler for 32 sites and radiocarbon dating for 29 samples revealed that the peat swamp forest had begun formation by 6500cal BP and expanded rapidly between 6500 and 5000cal BP and between 4000 and 2000cal BP to nearly the present distribution area. The thickness of the peat layer formed under the peat swamp forest reached approximately 4m, even in the margin of the peat dome, and more than 9m in the center. Stored carbon per unit volume of the peat layer was estimated to be between 30 and 44kgCm(-3) in the margin of the peat dome and approximately 26kgCm(-3) in the center, which was less than the general carbon values of the mangrove peat. The relatively higher amount of stored carbon per unit volume in the margin was possibly caused by an inflow of allochthonous carbon from flood deposits. Belowground carbon burial rate of the peat layer was calculated as between 31 and 105gCm(-2)years(-1) in the peat dome margin and between 27 and 76gCm(-2)years(-1) in the center, which were identical to mangrove peat.

There is limited published research available on the viability of large-scale deployments, which will depend on both the expected energy yield and potential adverse hydro-environmental impacts. This leads to the question of how best to position turbines in large-scale arrays for maximum energy capture with minimal associated hydro-environmental impacts. The primary aim of this research was the further development of an existing two-dimensional tidal flow model for optimising tidal turbine arrays relative to both power output and potential hydro-environmental impacts. Turbine impacts are simulated using a momentum sink approach and an optimisation algorithm was implemented, which determines an optimal array configuration for maximum energy capture, whilst employing spatial and environmental impact constraints. Application of the developed model to an idealised test case demonstrated that a staggered array is optimal, if one considers maximising power capture alone, while a fence layout was optimal, when considering both power output and associated impacts. In both the scenarios, the optimised configurations produced higher efficiencies than symmetrical inline arrays. To demonstrate the model's applicability to a real tidal environment, it was applied to a case study site; the Shannon Estuary, along the West Coast of Ireland. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first automated array optimisation model to incorporate hydro-environmental impact constraints with the aim of determining specific optimised array configurations with quantifiable efficiencies. The approach could be extremely useful for determining the economic viability of proposed arrays, enabling determination of `environmentally acceptable' levels of tidal energy extraction, and thereby allowing the completion of realistic and accurate early stage cost-benefit analyses for tidal energy projects. The model is therefore, potentially, a very valuable tool for tidal energy researchers, developers and planners.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,2198-6444,2198-6452,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Univ Ireland, Coll Engn & Informat, Galway, IrelandNatl Ctr Marine & Renewable Energy Ireland MaREI, Cork, IrelandNatl Univ Ireland, Ryan Inst Environm Marine & Energy Res, Galway, Ireland",Natl Ctr Marine & Renewable Energy Ireland MaREI,,,2019-08-01,WOS:000672007800005,,

A risk-based approach is best for successful design and engineering to meet HSE&E requirements. This study aimed to develop an advanced procedure for assessing the quantitative risk of offshore installations in explosions. Unlike existing industry practices based on prescriptive rules or qualitative approaches, the proposed procedure uses an entirely probabilistic approach. The procedure starts with probabilistic selection of accident scenarios. As the defining components of risk, both the frequency and consequences associated with selected accident scenarios are computed using the most refined technologies. Probabilistic technology is then applied to establish the relationship between the probability of exceedance and the physical values of the accident. Acceptance risk criteria can be applied to define the nominal values of design and/or level of risk.

The possibility that elevated CO2 concentrations may alter plant water relations is therefore particularly relevant to pastures and rangelands, and may have important consequences for grassland ecosystem function, water use, carbon storage and nutrient cycling. The planning of effective research to better understand these changes requires attention to both: (i) gaps in knowledge about CO2 and water interactions, and (ii) knowledge of how precisely the effects of CO2 must be understood in relation to other factors, in order to predict changes in grassland structure and production. A recent microcosm experiment illustrates that non-linear effects of CO2 and water stress could perturb primary production by triggering changes in grassland community composition. The magnitudes of the effects of CO2 on key grassland ecosystems remain to be precisely determined through ecosystem-level experiments. A simplified simulation of the impact of different levels of productivity change in a water-limited Australian rangeland system was conducted by varying effects of CO2 on radiation and water use efficiency. The results indicate that direct effects of CO2 may be moderated at the enterprise scale by accompanying changes in adaptive management by farmers. We conclude that future research should aim to construct quantitative relationships and identify thresholds of response for different grassland systems.

Isolated bacterial strains were primarily Gammaproteobacteria, including representatives of genera with known oil degraders (Alcanivorax, Marinobacter, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter). Sequence libraries generated from oiled sands revealed phylotypes that showed high sequence identity (up to 99%) to rRNA gene sequences from the oil-degrading bacterial isolates. The abundance of bacterial SSU rRNA gene sequences was similar to 10-fold higher in oiled (0.44 x 10(7) to 10.2 x 10(7) copies g(-1)) versus clean (0.024 x 10(7) to 1.4 x 10(7) copies g(-1)) sand.

Simplicity of design implied easy operation, maintenance and service. Efficiency was not a top priority. Now, in an atmosphere of operating budget cuts and skyrocketing fuel costs along with environmental responsibilities, efficiency improvements are expected, and in some cases demanded on main propulsion units. Additional load due to modern electronic combat systems places extra demand on SSTG sets. Modernization with improved efficiency, reliability and maintainability, while retaining design simplicity is the optimal solution.Meanwhile during the last 50 years, the turbomachinery industry has developed numerous innovative improvements through extensive R&D efforts, advanced computerized simulation of aerodynamics and flow field analysis along with finite element modeling, new manufacturing methods and improved metallurgy and surface treatments. These advances allow efficiency improvements without adding complexity to the design. Modern airfoil design, the optimized transition from partial-arc to full-arc steam admission, tangential. leaning vanes, advanced seal designs, streamlined steam path configuration and improved moisture removal are major areas worthy of consideration.Mechanical reliability can be improved with Taumel (orbital) peened tenons for blade packets or integral shrouds which give a 360 degree connection to all of the blades in a row. Electron beam welded diaphragms with EDM cut horizontal joints help to minimize thermal distortions and flow irregularities, particularly at the split lines. Improved welding procedures for casing, diaphragm and rotor repairs can result in shorter repair cycles and lower costs to further promote extension of the turbine's life cycle.Maintainability can be improved with advanced materials that no longer require regular service, such as anti-lube (greaseless) bushings and replaceable components that don't require in place machining.Combinations of the above improvements have been used successfully within the industry in upgrading hundreds of turbines, compressors and pumps in various applications including power generation, petrochemical, oil and gas, commercial marine, and other fields.

European standard off-the-shelf house bricks generated a maximum power of 1.2 mW (13.5 mW m 2 ) when fed with human urine. Ugandan house air bricks produced a maximum power of 2.7 mW (32.8 mW m 2 ), again with human urine. Different cathode types made by surface modifications using two kinds of carbon compounds and two PTFE based binders were tested in both wet and dry cathode conditions. The effects of both anode and cathode sizes, electrode connection, electrode configuration, and feedstock on brick MFC power generation were also studied. Water absorption test results showed higher porosity for the Ugandan air bricks than European engineering bricks, which contributed to its higher performance. This study suggests that the idea of converting existing and future buildings to micro-power stations and micro-treatment plants with the help of integrated MFCs and other renewable technologies is achievable, which will be a step closer to a truly sustainable life.

However, the action of PHB on the intestinal microbial community in the treated animals has not yet been studied in depth. In this research, the effects of PHB on the microbiota composition in the intestinal tract of juvenile sea bass were examined. It was found that fish cohabiting in the same tank were on average 87% similar regarding the intestinal microbiota. When subjected to the same treatment and environmental conditions but reared in different tanks, the compositions of the enteric communities diverged.

While in some cases resilient, deltas are increasingly threatened by natural and anthropogenic forces, such as sea level rise and land use change, which can drastically alter the rates and patterns of sediment transport. Quantifying process patterns can improve our predictive understanding of how different zones within delta systems will respond to future change. Available remotely sensed imagery can help, but appropriate tools are needed for pattern extraction and analysis. We present a method for extracting information about the nature and spatial extent of active geomorphic processes across deltas with 10 parameters quantifying the geometry of each of 1239 islands and the channels around them using machine learning. The method consists of a two-step unsupervised machine learning algorithm that clusters islands into spatially continuous zones based on the 10 morphological metrics extracted from remotely sensed imagery. By applying this method to the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta, we find that the system can be divided into six major zones. Classification results show that active fluvial island construction and bar migration processes are limited to relatively narrow zones along the main Ganges River and Brahmaputra and Meghna corridors, whereas zones in the mature upper delta plain with smaller fluvial distributary channels stand out as their own morphometric class. The classification also shows good correspondence with known gradients in the influence of tidal energy with distinct classes for islands in the backwater zone and in the purely tidally controlled region of the delta. Islands at the delta front under the mixed influence of tides, fluvial-estuarine construction, and local wave reworking have their own characteristic shape and channel configuration. The method is not able to distinguish between islands with embankments (polders) and natural islands in the nearby mangrove forest (Sundarbans), suggesting that human modifications have not yet altered the gross geometry of the islands beyond their previous natural morphology or that the input data (time, resolution) used in this study are preventing the identification of a human signature.

From the Raman spectroscopic data, it was possible to identify organic compounds such as anthraquinone and copal resin, which were empirically used as materia medica in the eighteenth century to treat shipboard diseases; it seems very likely, therefore, that the wooden chest belonged to the barber-surgeon on the ship.

Although lacustrine basins are important oil & gas productive areas of the world, gravity-induced deposits in these basins are poorly understood in the literature when compared with those documented in marine basins. Based on new insights from 3D seismic data, this paper attempts to investigate the effect of the interaction between gravity-induced flows and lake-floor topography on the resulting external geometry of gravity-induced deposits in the Cretaceous Qingshankou and Nenjiang formations of the Songliao Basin (SLB). Eight different shapes of gravity-induced deposits were identified in the SLB, and which were in turn grouped into four distinct categories according to external shape, internal architecture and spatial assembly: (1) Channel-fan complexes; (2) Fan-form complexes; (3) Strip-form complexes; and (4) Pond-form complexes. Furthermore, fan-form complexes can be subdivided into four subcategories (isolated fan with compressional ridges, isolated fan without compressional ridges, mother-son fans and stacked fans). Strip-form complexes can be subdivided into two subcategories, including strip-form controlled by gully system and strip-form controlled by growth faults.Sediment transport mechanism (density flows or mass transport flows) and lake-floor topography together influence the pathways, runout distances, discharge places and internal characteristics of gravity induced deposits, which could ultimately influence external geometries of gravity-induced deposits in the SLB. Consequently, sublacustrine gravity-induced deposits does not exhibit classic fan-like geometry. Frequent and powerful hyperpycnal flows associated with flood events are fairly common, and develop channel-distal fan complexes. MTDs exhibit various external geometries, which are significantly affected by growth faults, slope gullies, gradient, and basin-floor irregularities. The new depositional model built from the SLB is vital to understanding the distribution of gravity-flow deposits in a sublacustrine slope. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

When we study the maritime cross-cultural exchange in East Asia, the role of ship is outstanding. Recent years, ancient wrecked ships have been excavated in fairy good conditions from the sea in China and Korea, and intensive studies have been conducted from the stand point of archaeology and nautical archaeology. It is understood that engineering approach into such ships may contribute to make various historical events or incidents clear technically by confirming the historicity of documentary accounts and oral traditions. However, researches from engineering aspects are very limited especially in ship performances. One possible reason is that excavated ships are very limited in portion of the whole hull, and reconstruction of the exact whole hull shape is prevented. Another reason may be the difficulties in hull form conservation during excavation and reconstruction of wooden hull. In order to measure the hull form with the accuracy allowing us to draw hull lines, direct on-site measurement is preferable but difficult. On the other hand, recent technologies made it possible to measure various shapes without direct contact to the object. One typical application is 'laser optical systems' used in civil engineering, architecture and archaeology and so on. This is basically triangular survey to each point of target, and requires fairly long time.Another method is 'stereo photo system' which requires no direct contact. But the optical color-signal detection depends on the distinctiveness of color of the target point on the body, and such condition is often beyond our control. In the cases of wrecked wooden ships, it is usual that the hull is monotonic color of water-logged smooth surface. This makes it difficult to detect the exact three dimensional shape.In this study, stereo photo method is investigated combined with a newly developed multi-laser projection apparatus which makes it possible to mark multiple clear and distinctive targets on the body.For the first step, a model ship is used to simulate a wrecked ship with smooth and monotonic color body. The analysis of photographs and consecutive treatment of fairing technique are applied using a computer aided engineering tool in ship design. The results indicated that the ship dimensions and fullness factors of the hull form can be derived with reasonable accuracy within several percent.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0375-3271,,,,,,,,,,,"Tokai Univ, Mitsui Engn and Shipbldg Co Ltd, Sch Sci and Technol, Dept Naval Architecture and Ocean Engn, Hiratsuka, Kanagawa 25912, Japan",,,,2007-01-01,BCI:BCI200800084651,,

It is a partnership project led by AutoNaut Ltd, with the Universities of East Anglia and Exeter.The collaborative project will need to solve novel issues such as icing on a small USV, and autonomous ice avoidance, as well as harvesting energy on the move when it is too dark for PV panels to charge batteries. It will adopt advances in the use of neural networking and artificial intelligence to manage and summarise data gathered so that vital data sets can be transmitted in real time via satellite to shore.At present, there is a dearth of data from the Southern Ocean and Arctic, especially in winter. Very few ships pass through these enormous oceans. Not only do we have old and limited data on krill and fish stocks which may be threatened by a globally important fishery (legal and illegal), but climate scientists monitoring CO2 absorption at the surface have contradictory readings. Is the Southern Ocean giving off CO2, or absorbing it? This is a big question in climate science, and therefore for the global economy.From a commercial perspective, the development of a very robust AutoNaut USV, with the capability to operate in the dark, and near ice, has great potential around the world. Some of the most difficult areas for offshore renewables and oil and gas industries are in extremely hazardous environments, such as the North Sea, Barents Sea, and the Arctic, as well of off South Georgia and the Falklands.AutoNaut's wave propulsions system is elegant, and simple, with just four moving parts harnessing the pitching and rolling of a simple monohull to propel it forward. This system is inherently robust and is storm proven in the Atlantic, capsizing and self-righting in large breaking waves. It is seen as the only USV concept that has a chance of surviving such extreme environments. Solutions for icing and energy harnessing will give AutoNaut the capability for vital high latitude work of considerable importance both commercially and scientifically.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,104064,,,,,,,,Autonaut Limited,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15300986,,

The Precambrian Sinian Doushantuo Formation to Silurian Longmaxi black marine shales mainly accumulated in the intrashelf low to slope environments in the Yangtze Platform in South China and in the Tarim Platform in northwest China. The marine shales in the Yangtze Platform have high maturity (Ro of 1.3%-5%), high total organic carbon (mainly >2%), high brittle-mineral content, and have been identified as emerging shale gas plays. The Lower Paleozoic marine shales in the Upper Yangtze area have the largest shale gas potential and currently top the list as exploration targets. The Carboniferous to Permian shales associated with coal and sandstones were mainly formed in transitional depositional settings in north China, northwest China, and the Yangtze Platform in south China. These transitional shales are generally rich in clay with a medium level of shale gas potential. The Middle Permian to Cenozoic organic-rich lacustrine shales interbedded with thin sandstone and carbonate beds are sporadically distributed in rifted basins across China. Their main potentials are as hybrid plays (tight and shale oil). China shales are heterogeneous across time and space, and high-quality shale reservoirs are usually positioned within transgressive systems tract to early highstand systems tract intervals that were deposited in an anoxic depositional setting.

This review highlights the latest developments in the corrosion protective performance of various types of organic coating systems. These coating systems are expected to provide barrier and active protection at varying degrees to offshore metallic structures in these corrosion zones. Thus, the utilization of organic coatings in complex and aggressive environmental conditions such as offshore, for efficient control of the initiation of metallic degradation, structural failures, and resource depletion is highly desirable by offshore industry to ensure safe and productive drilling operations.

However, their effectiveness in reducing the pull-out load required is questioned by the offshore industry. To investigate their efficiency, centrifuge experiments of a reduced scale spudcan model with jets have been performed at the University of Western Australia. The footing was extracted from penetrations of up to 1.5 diameters in normally consolidated clay. Similar to spudcan extraction in the field, these were carried out under load control, applying a constant extraction force. Both influences of pull-out load magnitude and jetting flow rate were investigated. The study demonstrates that jetting is efficient in facilitating spudcan extraction, as it reduces the required uplift load.

A driving force for this trend is the C:H ratio, with the hydrogen component progressively increasing with time. In the ultimate analysis, it suggests a migration towards hydrogen. Meanwhile, the search for viable hydrocarbons continues since their combustion and utilization characteristics are understood. Gas reservoirs of limited significance have been found within the country, for example, coal bed methane and shale gas. Additionally, the prospect of obtaining gas in the long run, from gas hydrate reservoirs may become a reality. Such reservoirs have an added potential of storing large quantities of CO2 in hydrate form. Consequently, technologies from extraction of gas hydrates, energy conversion to an appropriate form all the way to exhaust gas disposal need to be re-visited and developed in the local context. As a start, this study describes a mathematical model of multi-species multi-phase transport in a porous reservoir, based on principles of conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The model equations are discretized and numerically solved to simulate flow and heat transfer in the hydrate reservoir, bounded by a depressurization and an injection well. As seen in the simulation, depressurization extracts methane from the reservoir while CO2 injection enhances the recovery rate largely due to the displacement of CH, by CO,. At the same time, hydrate formation of CO2 traps it in the reservoir providing additional structural integrity to the marine geological formation. The model, validated on a laboratory scale, needs to be tested under field-scale conditions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0370-0046,,,,,,,,,,,"Indian Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India",,,,2016-01-09,BCI:BCI201600109396,,

However, owing to the absence of monitoring wells in this production test, the hydrate dissociation behavior cannot be analyzed through pressure and temperature changes of hydrate reservoirs. This paper focuses on the simulation study on the detailed response of the temperature and pore pressure of hydrate reservoirs of Well SHSC-4 during the gas production by depressurization. Meanwhile, it highlights the analysis of favorable areas for the formation of secondary hydrates and the influence of the secondary hydrates on pressure and temperature field of hydrate reservoirs. The simulation results indicate that in the first 60 days, the hydrate reservoirs feature a dissociation radius of about 5 m, and the gas production from hydrate dissociation accounts for about 85%. After 1 year, 2 years and 5 years of hydrate exploitation, the influence radius of low-pressure area (<10 MPa) is 15 m, 16 m and 17 m, respectively, suggesting that the hydrate reservoirs have higher gas production efficiency in the first year. Furthermore, the temperature and pressure of hydrate reservoirs are not favorable to the formation of secondary hydrates in the first 60 days. In long-term production, secondary hydrates are mainly formed at hydrate dissociation front. This can increase the pore pressure and further decrease the effective stress in the local areas of hydrate reservoirs, thus affecting mechanical stability of the local hydrate reservoirs.",,,,,,,,,87,11,0,0,1,0,94,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,,,,,,,"China Geol Survey, Guangzhou Marine Geol Survey, Guangzhou 510075, Peoples R ChinaChina Geol Survey, Gas Hydrate Engn Technol Ctr, Guangzhou 510075, Peoples R ChinaChina Acad Geol Sci, Inst Explorat Tech, Langfang 065000, Peoples R ChinaChina Geol Survey, Ctr Oil & Nat Gas Resource Explorat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R ChinaPeking Univ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R ChinaCNPC Offshore Engn Co Ltd, Beijing 100102, Peoples R China",China Acad Geol Sci,,,2021-01-05,WOS:000596117700002,,

Usage of all-electric subsea technology instead of hydraulic technology is growing and will be the future of subsea systems due to the former's environmental and functional advantages and reduced costs. The benefits of all-electric subsea systems are health, safety, and environment (HSE) and improved reliability, flexibility, and functionality compared with traditional hydraulic-electrical systems. Existing electrohydraulic technology for a typical subsea system, hydraulic and electric actuators, and subsea manifold valves including valve types and selection philosophy have been reviewed in this paper. Some major worldwide oil companies such as Equinor and Schlumberger have successful experiences with subsea electric actuators. Considering the benefits of all-electric technology especially in terms of cost and HSE, as well as successful experiences of two major oil companies, further research in this area is warranted. One of the gaps in existing reviewed literature is the effect of using all-electric actuators for manifold valves. Thus, three main questions related to electric actuator selection, requirement of safety integrity level (SIL), and effect of using electric actuators on manifold valve selection have been addressed and answered. Forty hydraulic actuated manifold valves from nine past subsea projects in different parts of the world, mainly Africa and Australia, have been selected for the analysis of all-electric actuators. Results show that 93% of the valves require spring-return electric actuators, whereas 7% can be operated with conventional electric actuators without any spring. The manifold valves do not require SIL certification because they are not connected to an emergency shut down system. Introducing the electric actuators to the manifold valve will not change the valve selection philosophy.",,,,,,,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,,,1671-9433,1993-5048,,,,,,,,,,"Valve Engn, Baker Hughes, N-0477 Oslo, Norway",Valve Engn,,,2020-10-23,WOS:000577038100004,,

According to the investigation, for the most part, the contributions of deep-seated oil and gas to shallow gas hydrate field have likely been underappreciated. The restricted discrimination among different sources of carbon trapped within gas hydrate confines the recognition of leaking coexistence between deepwater petroleum systems and shallow gas hydrates. Significant attention has been paid to the hydrocarbon supply from deflected hydrocarbon migration by low-permeability hydrate-bearing sediments and gas hydrates dissociation during geological history to conventional petroleum accumulations. Except for very few geological provinces, the resource potential of free gas trapped beneath gas hydrate is not significant. In most cases, gas hydrate-bearing sediments are not a high quality seal, unless structural, stratigraphic, lithologic, or/and permafrost traps have been involved, forming a relatively effective trap for upward hydrocarbon flow.

As an actual example, supermartensitic stainless steels represent an attractive cost reducing alternative to higher alloyed and more expensive materials, and are thus increasingly applied as flowline materials at several North Sea oil and gas fields. At these locations, welded components are subjected to sour service conditions, providing a potential risk for hydrogen uptake, degradation and cracking of supermartensitic stainless steels. For this reason and due to the martensitic microstructure of the materials, particularly in the welded and quenched condition, their reliability regarding hydrogen assisted cracking as the most important failure mechanism has to be evaluated.The cracking resistance of supermartensitic stainless steels in sour environments has mainly been evaluated by small scale standard test procedures. For a closer insight into the phenomenology of hydrogen assisted cracking of these materials, the results of slow strain rate tests are summarized and related to respective numerical simulations of crack propagation. Based on such investigations, the present contribution provides an overview of the hydrogen related failure sequences and fracture modes in supermartensitic stainless steels and of first links to consistent and quantitative modelling of hydrogen assisted cracking in structural metallic materials.As a specific result, two different hydrogen related failure sequences of supermartensitic stainless steels have been identified. At severe sour service conditions the surface of the materials is activated and crack critical hydrogen concentrations might be taken up during black sulfide formation at the surface. At higher pH and lower H2S levels in the environment the steels are subjected to localized corrosion and subsequent hydrogen cracking starting from the inside of pits, caused by respective potential and pH drops. The fracture mode was found to be significantly dependent on the hydrogen concentration, altering from intergranular to cleavage-like cracking and finally towards microvoid coalescence with decreasing hydrogen levels. As a specific result, similar fracture modes for hydrogen assisted cold cracking and stress corrosion cracking have been found indicating that both types of hydrogen assisted cracking in these materials are internal phenomena with similar mechanisms.",,,,,International Conference on Hydrogen Effects on Material Behavior and Corrosion Deformation InteractionsInternational Conference on Hydrogen Effects on Material Behavior and Corrosion Deformation Interactions,"SEP 22-26, 2002SEP 22-26, 2002","Minerals, Met & Mat Soc, Struct Mat Div, TMS ASM Environm Effects Comm; European Federat Corros, Environm Sensit Fracture Working Grp; Natl Inst Stand & Technol; Sandia Natl LabsMinerals, Met & Mat Soc, Struct Mat Div, TMS ASM Environm Effects Comm; European Federat Corros, Environm Sensit Fracture Working Grp; Natl Inst Stand & Technol; Sandia Natl Labs","Moran, WYMoran, WY",4,3,0,0,0,0,7,,,,,0-87339-501-8,,,,,,,,,"Fed Inst Mat Res & Testing, BAM, Div Joining Technol V5, D-12205 Berlin, Germany",,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000222027500092,,

The equipment is composed of feeding machines, baiting machines, transport machines and a detection machine. Measurement and control system decides the running sequence logic of these components and obtains fault signals of tubing.

Before considering an area for exploitation, tidal energy resource assessments in pre-feasibility energy extraction areas must include the relevant characteristics of the device to be used. The present paper uses the momentum source approach to represent a floatable tidal energy converter (TECs) in a coastal hydro-morphodynamic model and to perform model simulations utilising different TEC array schernes by quantifying the aggregated drag coefficient of the device array. Simulations for one-month periods with nested models were performed to evaluate the hydrodynamic impacts of energy extraction using as output parameters the reduction in velocity and water-level variation differences against a no-extraction scenario. The case study focuses on representing the deployment of floatable E35 Evopod TECs in Sanda Sound (South Kintyre, Argyll, Scotland). The range in power output values from the simulations clearly reflects the importance of choosing the location of the array, as slight changes in the location (of <1 km) can approximately double the potential power output. However, the doubling of the installed capacity of TECs doubles the mean velocity deficit and water level differences in the area surrounding the extraction point. These differences are amplified by a maximum factor of 4 during peak flood/ebb during spring tides. In the simulations, the drag coefficient is set to be constant, which represents a fixed operational state of the turbine, and is a limitation of coastal models of this type that cannot presently be solved. Nevertheless, the nesting of models with different resolutions, as presented in this paper, makes it possible to achieve continuous improvements in the accuracy of the quantification of momentum loss by representing turbine characteristics close to the scale of the turbine.

Nitrate assimilation has long been taken as a measure of export production; however, this has recently been questioned by suggestions that much of the nitrate in the sunlit layer (the euphotic zone) originates from biological nitrogen (N) already in surface waters. This view has been supported by recent observations of euphotic zone nitrate elevated in delta O-18 relative to its delta N-15, taken as indicative of nitrification (the oxidation of recycled ammonium to nitrite and then nitrate). To evaluate the potential importance of nitrification in the Sargasso Sea euphotic zone, we measured the delta N-15 and delta O-18 of seawater nitrate for samples with >= 0.2 mu M nitrate collected on 18 cruises in the Sargasso Sea, and here we present the first large data set to correct for the low but often measurable concentrations of nitrite. Regardless of season, nitrate (i.e., nitrate-only rather than nitrate + nitrite as is commonly reported) delta N-15 and delta O-18 increase in unison from below the base of the euphotic zone toward the surface. This pattern derives from nitrate assimilation by phytoplankton, implying that nitrification is much slower than the upward transport of nitrate into the lower Sargasso Sea euphotic zone. In the twilight zone below the euphotic zone, we observe a rise in nitrate delta O-18 (relative to deeper waters) that is not accompanied by a rise in delta N-15, suggesting nitrification co-occurring with nitrate assimilation. Nitrification, therefore, does not appear to occur in euphotic zone waters overlapping with nitrate assimilation only in the similar to 150 m-thick twilight zone layer below it. In net, the data argue for a simpler N cycle for the Sargasso Sea euphotic zone than has recently been suggested, with the rate of euphotic zone nitrate assimilation approximating that of organic carbon export to the deep ocean.

Results showed that thicker slicks exposed to calm water for up to six days dispersed completely with the addition of breaking waves.

(FIRE BLANKET),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 15 2019,2019,"In good condition, peatlands are the most efficient soil carbon store, regulate freshwater and climate, and maintain biodiversity. However, management interventions can jeopardise the delivery of all these services by destabilising the vast C store that peat has locked away over thousands of years. In the UK, up to 80% of UK peatlands are damaged and release carbon back to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases like CO2 and methane, which amplify climate change in the same way that fossil fuels do. Furthermore, destabilisation of the peat carbon store can alter the flow and the quality of water within the peatlands and into streams, rivers and all the way to the sea. This can affect drinking water supplies as well as freshwater and marine habitats and wildlife. Importantly, disturbed peatlands may also become more vulnerable to stress, including severe drought and wildfires - events which are predicted to increase with future climate change.Understanding how land-use interacts with climate extremes in peatlands is essential to inform which management practices are likely to best maintain and enhance peatland carbon storage. However, this is notoriously challenging to achieve. Indeed, climate extremes are rare and ephemeral by nature, and therefore can only be opportunistically studied. In addition, their effects can only be truly assessed where high-quality ground-based observations pre-date a given extreme event, and where data from both impacted and similar control areas can be compared afterwards. These conditions rarely come together, but when they do, they provide unique opportunities. Following a dry and warm spring, in mid-May 2019, a large wildfire burnt approximately >60 km2 within the Flow Country peatlands of Caithness and Sutherland, North Scotland. Covering 4000km2, the Flow Country is a site of global significance currently under consideration for UNESCO World Heritage Site status. Nevertheless, it has also been substantially modified in places by drainage and notably forestry (with non-native conifer trees), making those areas particularly vulnerable to catastrophic deep burning. Unlike other wildfires in the UK, the May 2019 Flow Country fire covers an exceptionally large area that includes peatlands in a range of conditions: drained, drained and afforested, under restoration (through forestry removal and drain blocking) and near-natural. These areas are also actively used for scientific research, with a wide range of prior data and a mature collaborative network of researchers and land managers currently in place. The May Flow Country fire has therefore created an unprecedented and urgent opportunity to quantify the interacting effects of fire, drought and past human interventions on peatland carbon storage and water quality.We want to seize this opportunity. First, we want to compare burn severity, carbon losses during the fire, and initial recovery across the different peatland management types. To do that, we will combine ground measurements, UAV images and a newly validated method that uses satellite radar data to measure peat surface motion. This method works because the peat surface motion is a direct response to water storage in the peat, and the type of plants on the peat surface. These in turn are the main indicators of peat condition. By comparing data in the periods prior to and after the wildfire, we can examine the ability of peatland to recover from such an event. Secondly, we will measure aqueous and gaseous carbon emissions across a range of burnt and unburnt land-uses and we will quantify changes in the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter, in order to understand how changes attributed to the fire alter the fate of peatland C. Finally, we will use our new knowledge and consult with land managers to compare how different management strategies of forestry and forest-to-bog restoration influence fire risk and damage in order to make recommendations for management and policy.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/T00651X/1,,,,,,,,NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15378582,,

For technical and economic reasons, processing of hydrocarbons is preferred on the seabed in ultra-deepwater sites instead of doing it on a host platform at the surface. Since the use of AC subsea transmission and distribution system to supply subsea process becomes impractical once beyond the critical length limit of AC submarine cables due to their capacitive charging current, a modular stacked DC (MSDC) subsea transmission and distribution system emerges as a promising technology alternative. Allowing only the faulty module to be retrieved for repair, wet-mate (WM) DC connectors are key to the reduction of downtime for the complete MSDC system. While there is no commercially available WM DC power connector, a time-dependent full thermo-electrodynamic model comprised of Poisson's equation, three charge continuity equations-one each for the positive and negative ions and one for the electrons-, and a thermal diffusion equation is developed to study the streamer initiation and propagation in the oil portion of a WM DC chamber. The envisaged geometry of a WM DC connector containing oil-solid insulation systems located in a cylindrical electrode geometry is considered for simulation.

To understand the metabolic response of marine microorganisms, we sequenced similar to 66 million community transcripts that revealed the identity of metabolically active microbes and their roles in petroleum consumption. Reads were assigned to reference genes from similar to 2700 bacterial and archaeal taxa, but most assignments (39%) were to just six genomes representing predominantly methane-and petroleum-degrading Gammaproteobacteria. Specific pathways for the degradation of alkanes, aromatic compounds and methane emerged from the metatranscriptomes, with some transcripts assigned to methane monooxygenases representing highly divergent homologs that may degrade either methane or short alkanes. The microbial community in the plume was less taxonomically and functionally diverse than the unexposed community below the plume; this was due primarily to decreased species evenness resulting from Gammaproteobacteria blooms. Surprisingly, a number of taxa (related to SAR11, Nitrosopumilus and Bacteroides, among others) contributed equal numbers of transcripts per liter in both the unexposed and plume samples, suggesting that some groups were unaffected by the petroleum inputs and blooms of degrader taxa, and may be important for re-establishing the pre-spill microbial community structure.",,,,,,,,,116,0,0,0,101,0,124,,,1751-7362,1751-7370,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USADOE Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA USA",,,,2013-12-01,WOS:000327451800007,23902988,

Shallow coastal bays are found along much of the east coast, and are particularly vulnerable to the effects of excess nitrogen, which can lead to algal blooms, low dissolved oxygen, and loss of high-habitat quality seagrasses. This research will examine the recovery of a shallow bay as nitrogen inputs are greatly reduced without any concomitant change in inputs of other nutrients and pollutants, making it perhaps the first such study in the US. The site, West Falmouth Harbor on Cape Cod (MA), has received high levels of nitrogen inputs for the past 15 years, due to contamination of incoming groundwater by a sewage treatment plant, causing poor water quality and habitat degradation. The nitrogen contamination has now been cleaned up, and so nitrogen inputs entering the harbor will be 3-fold less than in the past. To date, relatively few coastal bays have recovered from excessive nitrogen inputs, so this study will provide information on the rate of recovery and extent of restoration of habitat quality that is critical to better manage and protect these valuable coastal resources. While most coastal scientists believe nitrogen is the primary cause of coastal eutrophication, this remains debated. This study will provide important insights as to not only whether nitrogen is the controlling nutrient, but if so, why. One hypothesis is that a large net import of phosphorus from deeper coastal water helps maintain N limitation. If so, net phosphorus import should decline as primary production (and resultant demand for phosphorus) declines. The research will also explore the relationship of carbon storage to net ecosystem production, testing the hypothesis that lower nitrogen inputs will shift the ecosystem towards greater heterotrophy. Will the harbor continue to store carbon, by importing more carbon than the net amount respired? These questions will be addressed by measuring rates of primary production and ecosystem respiration from diel changes in dissolved oxygen and pH, seagrass extent and biomass elemental composition, and by measuring the exchanges of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon between the harbor and the deeper adjacent coastal waters of Buzzards Bay, MA. Results will be compared with 12 years of data taken during the high nitrogen loading period, and will thus provide a strong picture of the recovery trajectory of the system.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1654845,,,,,,,,Cornell University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13849571,,

The results obtained suggest that the reservoir has good potential to be a storage place for CO2, although the compaction behavior and aquifer supports of the reservoir might cause some difficulties.

The results suggested that an extended exposure period (more than 16 weeks) would be required for the formation of DNA adduct levels above background.

Dissolved oxygen of bottom water is consumed by the organic sludge on the sea bottom through decomposition processes. In a stratified season, the bottom water has little oxygen in contrast with the fully oxygen saturated surface water. As the result of this, the low oxygen water not only damages cultured fish, but also the organic and inorganic nutrient salts in the bottom mud diffuse into the water, Some of the nutrient salts, such as nitrous acid, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, etc. are toxic. Therefore, the water quality environment becomes unsuited to the fish culture because of the pollution by itself. To prevent bottom water stagnation and nutrient salt diffusion from the bottom mud, several engineering techniques have been attempted. In this study, a new technique, called tide-dam, is suggested to improve the water quality environment by generating the vertical circulation and preventing the oxygen deficiency of bottom sea water. This simple structure is designed to control the oxygen deficient condition with the aid of phytoplankton photosynthesis by using the tidal energy.

Experimental datasets, including ADCP water current measurements and the trajectories of drifter buoys released in the area, were used to evaluate the accuracy of this system. A comparison between the simulation results and experimental data revealed that both the water circulation and the surface transport processes are accurately reproduced by the model. The overall accuracy of the system in reproducing the transport of an oil spill at sea was estimated for both forward and backward prediction mode and in relation to different forecasting time lags.

This logistic concept is eventually to define all personnel and material sources, discrete supply points including routings and hence infrastructure, and transportation equipment to address the requirements over the full lifetime of an asset. Typically, due to a vast amount of options for infrastructure (roads, ports, bases), the stochastic nature of impacting parameters, a distinct set of requirements for different phases in the lifetime - i.e. from development to abandonment - and the potentially changing business environment over time, finding an optimum integrated logistics solution is a difficult task without any system(atic) and/ or software support.This subject matter led TU Delft and Shell E&P (Exploration & Production) to take a joint approach to develop a software tool that is to determine the optimum logistic concept for new developments in a new (greenfield) or existing business environment (brownfield). Objectives defined included to develop a generic tool for generating a number of alternative, but potentially optimum concepts for any given business environment. Secondly, objectives included the tool to evaluate all generated concepts using simulation techniques, assess performance by defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and advise robustness of the concept to external stochastic variables (e.g. weather, delays in material supplies and people movements).This paper presents the tool development and how to interactively generate of a set of feasible concepts and assess concepts' robustness by KPIs, which include operational cost, availability, operational safety and environmental impact.",,,,,6th International Industrial Simulation Conference6th International Industrial Simulation Conference,"JUN 09-11, 2008JUN 09-11, 2008",European Technol Inst; European Simulat Soc; ADICTEL; AEKI; CREAX; Delft Univ Technol; Ghent Univ; IPK Fraunhofer; P4; Ville Villeurbanne; UPVEuropean Technol Inst; European Simulat Soc; ADICTEL; AEKI; CREAX; Delft Univ Technol; Ghent Univ; IPK Fraunhofer; P4; Ville Villeurbanne; UPV,"Univ Lyon - CESH, Lyon, FRANCEUniv Lyon - CESH, Lyon, FRANCE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-90-77381-4-03,,,,,,,,,,,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000263829300042,,

These applications substantially differ from common applications, such as floating oil and gas installations in that they are more dynamic. Power cables that cross the water column, so-called umbilicals will be exposed to considerable extreme and fatigue loads mainly induced by the motion of the device, incident waves and tidal current. The actual loading regimes of dynamic submarine power cables in operation are not well understood for marine renewable energy (MRE) applications due to a lack of field experience. The cable design has to consider a combination of cable geometry, hydrodynamic parameters, suitable layout configuration, suitable ancillary systems (e.g. bend stiffeners) in relation to the environmental site conditions.This paper evaluates the influence of the environmental conditions and the cable design parameters on the mechanical loads and potential failure modes of a dynamic submarine power cable attached to a dynamic floating body in form of a generic point absorber. One notable result is the large effect of the tidal direction, even in relatively moderate flow conditions. The full range of tidal flow conditions should be considered in the power cable design to ensure that the cable MBR is not exceeded in any conditions. The shown configurations also give some insight into the possible variations of the geometric cable configuration. A well balanced S-curve shape yields some of the best results and achieves a good load distribution along the cable and the transition points, whilst avoiding cable compression. The design challenge for the cable configuration is to maintain the S-shape for as many environmental and device response modes as possible in order to achieve high reliability. This paper will be useful for cable, device and site developers of floating MRE to inform the selection of the most suitable cable design.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-5766-3,,,,,,,,,"Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, EnglandHYDROCEAN, 8 Blvd Albert Einstein, F-44323 Nantes 3, FranceEcole Cent Nantes, BP 92101, Nantes, France",HYDROCEAN,,,2017-12-27,WOS:000417224700010,,

However, the mechanisms governing soil carbon accumulation and weathering during initial phases of ecosystem development are not well understood. We examined soil organic matter dynamics and soil development across a high-altitude (3,560-3,030 m) 20-kyr climate gradient on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Four elevation sites were selected (similar to 250-500 mm rainfall), which range from sparsely vegetated to sites that contain a mix of shrubs and grasses. At each site, two or three pits were dug and major diagnostic horizons down to bedrock (intact lava) were sampled. Soils were analyzed for particle size, organic C and N, soil pH, exchangeable cations, base saturation, NaF pH, phosphorous sorption, and major elements. Mass loss and pedogenic metal accumulation (hydroxlamine Fe, Al, and Si extractions) were used to measure extent of weathering, leaching, changes in soil mineralogy and carbon accumulation. Reactive-phase (SRO) minerals show a general trend of increasing abundance with increasing rainfall. However carbon accumulation patterns across the climate gradient are largely decoupled from these trends. The results suggest that after 20 kyr, pedogenic processes have altered the nature and composition of the volcanic ash such that it is capable of retaining soil C even where organic acid influences from plant material and leaching from rainfall are severely limited. Carbon storage comparisons with lower-elevation soils on Mauna Kea and other moist mesic (2,500 mm rainfall) sites on Hawaii suggest that these soils have reached only between 1% and 15% of their capacity to retain carbon. Our results suggest that, after 20 kyr in low rainfall and a cold climate, weathering was decoupled from soil carbon accumulation patterns and the associated influence of vegetation on soil development. Overall, we conclude that the rate of carbon supply to the subsoil (driven by coupling of rainfall above ground plant production) is a governing factor of forms and amount of soil organic matter accumulation, while soil mineralogy remained relatively uniform.",,,,,,,,,35,4,0,0,20,0,42,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,,,,,,,"Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Vancouver, WA 98686 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,,2016-09-01,WOS:000382527100022,27859095,

The effectiveness of the insulation over the entire lifetime is essential to provide flow assurance. Fluid temperatures must be kept high enough to ensure that waxes or hydrates do not form and result in pipeline blockages.The operating environment for offshore pipelines will become more severe with planned developments in 2000 m waters having well temperatures of up to 160degreesC. Insulation systems proposed for such deepwater wells are typically multilayered with foamed polymers providing most of the thermal resistance. The high hydrostatic pressures and well temperatures associated with deepwater wells can lead to a degradation of the thermal performance of foamed materials due to creep.The prediction of the long-term thermal behaviour is complex. The material characteristics of foams are dependent on the density, temperature and stress level, all of which change with time as the material creeps. This leads to a non-linear coupled thermal-structural response. This paper describes analytical models, which predict the system behaviour over time. These models have been implemented in a user-friendly design tool, named DISDANS. Good agreement is found between the model results and equivalent finite element models. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

With using cluster analysis, all regions of Russia are divided into groups on tax burden and benefits. The Arctic resource regions are shown to be distributed over two clusters: regions that have a high tax burden due to significant oil production (some of them are traditional and receive fewer benefits); regions that receive significant benefits from the government to intensify oil production.

In this study we investigated assimilation of ammonium, nitrate, glycine and methane using N-15- and C-13-labelled tracers to determine sites of assimilation, rates of assimilation, and the chemical form in which assimilated C and N appears. We then investigated the interaction between inorganic nitrogen assimilation and methane assimilation to assess whether they are directly dependent on each other. (NO3-)-N-15, (NH3)-N-15 and (CH4)-C-13 were assimilated primarily into the gills where the bacteria are located, with negligible incorporation into symbiont-free tissue. In contrast, (CN)-C-13-N-15-glycine was assimilated equally into gill and symbiont-free tissue. These results indicate that inorganic N is assimilated in the gill tissue. The bulk of C-13 and N-15 label from methane and ammonium incubations was in the 80% EtOH soluble fraction, suggesting that the primary assimilation product was low-molecular-weight metabolites. Some C-13 was incorporated into carbon storage products. Mussels that assimilated excess (CH4)-C-13 converted 35% of (CH4)-C-13 into an EtOH insoluble form. Negligible N-15 label was observed in this fraction. Inorganic N assimilation and methane assimilation were not tightly coupled. N assimilation was not affected by absence of methane or inhibition of methanotrophy. Methane assimilation was not stimulated by increased N assimilation. Seep mytilids were capable of luxury consumption of inorganic N, i.e. C/N assimilation ratios below the average C/N ratio of mussel tissues (4.2). We believe that luxury consumption is supported by C reserves resulting in part from methanotrophy. From relations between CH4 and N source concentration and assimilation rate, we estimated the environmental conditions that result in balanced C/N assimilation. From this analysis we predict that at environmentally realistic methane and inorganic N concentrations seep mytilids assimilate excess CH4.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,6,0,16,,,0171-8630,,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT BIOL SCI, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USAUNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, INST MARINE SCI, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA",,,,1995-07-01,WOS:A1995RQ34100014,,

The objectives of this study are to identify the source of total GR, and to discuss criteria for reasonable shale evaluation by the combined use of sediment core and GR logging analysis using a case study of the CO2 storage aquifer at the Nagaoka site in Japan. The aquifer is comprised of shallow-marine siliciclastic deltaic deposits characterized by prodelta to delta front fades. The profile of total GR output is consistent with that of mud content, suggesting that the main source of GR can be attributed to minerals in the mud fraction. Prior to comparison of the radioactive elements measured by spectral gamma-ray (SGR) logging and elements from core analysis with total GR, elements were transformed to centered log-ratios to remove constant-sum constraints. Evaluation of the total GR profile with radioactive elements from SGR logging indicates that the distribution of thorium (Th) exhibits a high contrast between prodelta and delta front deposits. Th content has a significant positive correlation with total GR, implying that Th-bearing minerals mostly appear in fine-grained fraction. Conversely, the distribution of potassium (K) has a significant negative correlation with total GR, implying that K-bearing minerals appear in coarse-grained fraction. Based on geochemical analysis of the sediment core, minerals composed of Mg, Ti, Fe, Zr, and Th are likely to be radioactive carriers in the fine-grained fraction, and those containing Na, Al, Si, K, Rb, and Sr are considered to be the radioactive carriers in the coarse-grained fraction. The former can be attributed to detrital zircon grains and clay minerals, including smectite and chlorite, which contain or adsorb the radioactive Th, and the latter can be attributed to K-feldspar. The dispersion diagram between total GR and radioactive elements at observation wells emphasizes the differences in the endmembers of total GR between the two depositional sequences. The estimated shale volume is concordant with measured values if we select the endmembers at each depositional sequence. This means that the endmembers should be selected independently for each depositional sequence to enhance the reliability of shale evaluation. For improving shale evaluation, the combined use of GR logging and detailed core analysis in terms of sedimentology and geochemistry appears to be effective for reliably assessing shale volume in the target strata.

The sensor measurement using factory calibrations for the LI-CO2 820 is typically within 1 micromol/mol of the reference gas value. If the LI-COR 820 measurements and the CO2-in-air reference gas values are different by more than 2 micromol/mol, a correction is applied to Li-CO2 820 output based the reference gas values. A seawater bath operated over a range of temperatures and CO2 expected in the field is then used to check the MapCO2 system (equilibrator and LI-COR 820 measurement) against a General Oceanics 8050 CO2 sensor to ensure the systems agree within 2 micromol/mol. Pressure measurements are made using the LI-COR 820 pressure sensor, checked against a Druck DPI142 pressure indicator and verified to agree within 0.5 kPa before and after each deployment. Seaphox: SBE 37 (T, S, DO) and the SeaFET (pH) are calibrated by the factory and verified in the CSIRO laboratory. The pH reported in the files is flagged questionable for the pre-deployment calibrated data due to possible calibration changes which can occur after deployment pH (calibrated) is further processed after the recovery using in situ bottle sample where available, using Total Alkalinity (TA) and Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), which will be converted to pH using CO2SYS, where the Lueker k1k2 dissociation constant is used.

In this paper, the authors propose a new three-dimensional (3D) theory which considers the effect of axial rotation on dropped cylindrical objects. The 3D method is based on a modified slender body theory for maneuvering. A numerical tool called Dropped Objects Simulator (DROBS) has been developed based on this 3D theory. Firstly, simulated results of a dropped drilling pipe model using a 2D theory by Aanesland (1987) are compared with results from 3D theory when rolling frequency is zero. Good agreement is found. Further, factors that affect the trajectory, such as drop angle, normal drag coefficient, binormal drag coefficient and rolling frequency are systematically investigated. It is found that drop angle, normal drag coefficient and rolling frequency are the three most critical factors determining the trajectories. Finally, a low rolling frequency case is studied.

This area delimits the set of long-term power-generation portfolios that can be selected to achieve a progressive decarbonisation of the mix. This work confirms the relevant role of small hydro, offshore wind, and large hydro as preferential technologies in efficient portfolios. It is necessary to include all available renewable technologies in order to reduce the cost and the risk of the portfolio, benefiting from the diversification effect. Additionally, carbon capture and storage technologies must be available and deployed if fossil fuel technologies remain in the portfolio in a low-carbon approach.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Univ A Coruna, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Business, Campus Elvina, La Coruna 15071, SpainUniv Porto, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Porto, PortugalUniv Porto, CEF UP, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Porto, Portugal",,,,2019-12-12,WOS:000498072600010,,

Carbon is in all living things, the ocean, the earth, and the atmosphere. Increasing carbon in the atmosphere has led to climate change, which has had major effects across the globe. One effect has been increasing wildfires in northern ecosystems. In these ecosystems, large amounts of carbon are stored in soils. This carbon can be stored for a long time and is sometimes very old. Wildfires that burn these soils can release this old carbon to the atmosphere and cause more climate warming. This project will determine where and when this old carbon is burning. This information will help us understand how increasing wildfires will affect future climate. It will also help fire managers set priorities for where to fight fires. We will share our results with rural northern communities near our research sites and with citizens and youth of Northern Arizona.<br/><br/>This research will investigate how increasing wildfires will impact the long-term carbon storage of Arctic ecosystems. Arctic ecosystems store over 40% of terrestrial carbon and have historically been considered carbon sinks. This means they store more carbon than they lose to the atmosphere. Carbon in these ecosystems is primarily stored in soils for long periods, sometimes centuries. Periodic wildfires release some soil carbon to the atmosphere. Any soil carbon that escapes burning in a previous fire is called 'legacy carbon.' Due to climate warming, wildfires have increased in frequency and severity in northern ecosystems. More severe and frequent wildfires can combust legacy carbon and shift Arctic ecosystems from a carbon sink to a carbon source to the atmosphere. The main objective of this research is to determine the processes that control legacy carbon combustion. Understanding where and when legacy carbon combustion is likely to occur is essential for predicting how frequently Arctic ecosystems will shift from a carbon sink to a carbon source. These results will benefit global stakeholders, including policymakers, by improving our understanding of the mechanisms through which environmental change affects the global carbon cycle and climate. For regional and local stakeholders, such as fire managers, this research will improve our ability to identify areas vulnerable to legacy carbon combustion to better prioritize management decisions. We will share our results with fire managers by partnering with the Alaska Fire Science Consortium. We will also engage with rural communities in Interior Alaska by hiring a local guide and communicating our research goals, progress, and findings with community members. Finally, we will engage with citizens, particularly youth, of Northern Arizona about Arctic research by participating in our local festival of science.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Arctic Natural Sciences Program and the Division of Environmental Biology<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2019515,,,,,,,,Northern Arizona UniversityNorthern Arizona University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15134429,,

These greater water depths place significant demands on the drilling riser and the riser tensioning system. Modem riser tensioners are complex hydro-pneumatic systems and far from applying a constant top tension, the stiffness and damping characteristics associated with the tensioner mean that the applied tension can vary substantially as the tensioner strokes in response to vessel heave. As a result it is critical that the riser tensioner system response be captured in sufficient detail when evaluating the loads on the drilling riser.Riser tensioner systems for deepwater drilling must be capable of supplying the required tension to satisfy the minimum stability tension requirement, as per API RP 16Q; however this recommended practice does not adequately account for dynamic tensioner load variation, which can be up to 50% of the nominal tension. For deepwater drilling riser systems, where riser load limits are being approached, accurate modeling of the tensioner system load variation is required to ensure that the riser does not experience compression or excessive stresses. Furthermore, as the dynamic tension variations are largely velocity dependent, they can be relatively independent of water depth. Thus larger percentage variations in tension are experienced at low tensions when compared to higher tensions. This is an important consideration when calculating minimum top tensions for deepwater drilling rigs in shallower water depths.This paper presents a comparison of the response of a direct-acting riser tensioner (DAT) system for a range of environments. The comparison is based on results from detailed tensioner models that include the individual hydraulic and pneumatic components of the tensioner system and that are fully integrated with a non-linear 3D structural FE analysis tool [1]. The FE model is based on a widely-validated-non-linear software tool [3]. The detailed tensioner model has been validated against manufacturer performance data for existing in-service tensioner systems. The detailed tensioner model has also been used as part of a drilling riser recoil analysis study [1] which provided a good comparison of recoil analysis results against a published recoil test case. The impact on the global riser response of accurately modeling the tensioner system behavior is demonstrated, while the implications for the calculation of minimum top tension are also discussed.",,,,,"31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUL 01-06, 2012JUL 01-06, 2012","Petrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivPetrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL",2,1,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,978-0-7918-4490-8,,,,,,,,,"MCS Kenny, Galway, Ireland",MCS Kenny,,,2013-11-05,WOS:000324565500066,,

Extensive knowledge on effective management practices related to improved compliance with safety procedures is therefore needed. Previous studies of the causal relationship between safety climate and safety compliance demonstrate that the propensity to act in accordance with prevailing rules and procedures is influenced to a large degree by workers' safety climate. Commonly, the climate measures employed differ from one study to another and identical measures of safety climate are seldom tested repeatedly over extended periods of time. This research gap is addressed in the present study. Method: The study is based on a survey conducted four times among sharp-end workers of the Norwegian oil and gas industry (N = 31,350). This is done by performing multiple tests (regression analysis) over a period of 7 years of the causal relationship between safety climate and safety compliance. The safety climate measure employed is identical across the 7-year period. Conclusions: Taking all periods together, the employed safety climate model explained roughly 27% of the variance in safety compliance. The causal relationship was found to be stable across the period, thereby increasing the reliability and the predictive validity of the factor structure. The safety climate factor that had the most powerful effect on safety compliance was work pressure. Practical applications: The factor structure einployed shows high predictive validity and should therefore be relevant to organizations seeking to improve safety in the petroleum sector. The findings should also be relevant to other high-hazard industries where safety rules and procedures constitute a central part of the approach to managing safety.

However, this condition is used for isolation in the laboratory because it is considered a necessary property for pathogenesis. In this context, revealing how gene expression enables V. parahaemolyticus to adapt to this particular condition -common to almost all V. parahaemolyticus isolates-will improve our understanding of the biology of this important pathogen. To determine the genes of V. parahaemolyticus differentially expressed when growing in isolation condition (37 degrees C, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.04% bile salts) referred to those at the temperature and salt concentration prevailing in ocean south of Chile (marine-like condition; 12 degrees C, 3% NaCl, and absence of bile salts) we used high-throughput sequencing of RNA.Results: Our results showed that in the isolation condition, among the 5034 genes annotated in the V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633 genome, 344 were upregulated and 433 downregulated referred to the marine-like condition, managing an adjusted P-value (Padj) < E-5. Between the 50 more highly expressed genes, among the small RNAs (sRNA), the three carbon storage regulators B (CsrB) were up four to six times, while RyhB, related to iron metabolism besides motility control, was down about eight times. Among proteins, BfdA, a hemolysin-co-regulated protein (Hcp1) secreted by T6SS1, one of the most highly expressed genes, was about 140 times downregulated in isolation condition. The highest changes in relative expression were found among neighboring genes coding for proteins related to respiration, which were about 40 times upregulated.Conclusions: When V. parahaemolyticus is grown in conditions used for laboratory isolation 777 genes are up-or downregulated referred to conditions prevailing in the marine-like condition; the most significantly overrepresented categories among upregulated processes were those related to transport and localization, while secretion and pathogenesis were overrepresented among downregulated genes.

These cables are considered the lifeline of subsea production systems for offshore oil and gas exploitation. Umbilicals should undertake self-weight and periodic loading during operation because of the severe conditions of the ocean environment. Heat is released to the umbilical body during power transmission in electric cables, which influences the mechanical properties and optical transmission in the cable. However, several sectional arrangements can be applied to a number of umbilical components. Thus, sectional layout design with multiple components should be treated as a multidisciplinary optimization problem. From the mechanical point of view, the umbilical structure should be designed with compact and symmetric layout to obtain an even probability of resistance to loads and reduce structural stress, thereby improving fatigue performance. In terms of thermal effect, these electric cables should be arranged to dissipate heat easily and avoid influence on functional and structural components. This study quantifies compactness, symmetry, and temperature distribution by introducing corresponding indices. A multidisciplinary optimization framework is then established.

Most of these structures are saline water-bearing, although some of then) do contain significant gas accumulations, suggesting that the brine-saturated domes may have potential for the long-term storage of CO2. This study investigates the effect of geological structure and heterogeneity on CO2 storage through the use of geological models and reservoir simulation. Dynamic modeling focussed on the determination of the storage efficiency of a particular dome and from this, its CO2 storage capacity. Under initial modeling conditions, a storage efficiency of around 19 Vo was derived, though this is shown to be highly sensitive to a range of uncertain parameters. An interesting interplay exists between the reservoir heterogeneity and dome structure, whereby the evolving CO2 plume is prevented from risirtg buoyantly to the top of the formation by the presence of impermeable horizons, which facilitates rapid migration towards the structural spill-points. Sensitivity analysis further emphasizes the importance of characterizing reservoir heterogeneity in studies for long-term carbon capture and storage. (C) 2013 Natural Environment Reseanth Council.

However, information on the spatial arrangement of above ground live biomass (AGLB) is lacking and while the influence of replication on estimated AGLB has been studied, it has rarely been the focus in Australian ecosystems. This study examined spatial arrangement of AGLB, the influence of survey design, and interactions between abiotic factors and AGLB. Above ground live biomass was measured in a remnant eucalypt forest at Karawatha Forest Park (similar to 900 ha), a long term ecological research site (LTER node) within the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) South-east Queensland Pen-urban Supersite, Australia. Sampling of woody vegetation occurred in 32 one-hectare plots systematically placed at 500 m intervals. Above ground live biomass was estimated to be 146.51 Mg ha(-1), with spatial interpolation calculating that there was 133,487 Mg of AGLB (>1 cm DBH) within Karawatha Forest Park. Time and effort could be saved by not measuring trees <10 cm, because only similar to 7% of the AGLB biomass (>1 cm) would be lost. Despite relatively low variation in AGLB among plots, bootstrapping indicated that at least 15 PPBio (Program for Planned Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research) plots are needed to precisely estimate AGLB within Karawatha Forest Park. Topography and soil chemistry performed poorly at explaining AGLB, and it is likely that past and present human activities (e.g. logging and arson) play a role in influencing AGLB at Karawatha Forest Park. This study identifies the importance of independent replication to capture variation in AGLB for carbon storage estimation, and the power of systematic sampling within sites for mapping carbon stocks at meso and larger scales.

We evaluate the regional vertical temperature gradient within stratigraphic units based on the analysis of 34 boreholes drilled in the region. To show that the thermal gradient is altered in the vicinity of salt diapirs, we study measured temperatures in six deep boreholes. We develop a three-dimensional geothermal model of the ASAR region constrained by temperature measurements, seismic stratigraphic and lithological data. The temperatures of the sub-salt sediments predicted by the geothermal model range from about 100 degrees C to 200 degrees C and are consistent with the temperatures obtained from the analysis of vitrinite reflectivity and from previous two-dimensional geothermal models. Temperature anomalies are positive in the uppermost portions of salt diapirs as well as within the salt-withdrawal basins at the depth of 3.5 km depth and are negative beneath the diapirs. Two areas of positive temperature anomalies in the sub-salt sediments are likely to be associated with the deep withdrawal basins above and with the general uplift of salt/sub-salt interface in the southern part of the study region. This implies an enhancement of thermal maturity of any organically rich source rocks within these areas. The surface heat flux in the model varies laterally from about 40 to 55 mW m-2. These variations in the heat flux are likely to be associated with structural heterogeneities of the sedimentary rocks and with the presence of salt diapirs.

Then, we predicted the long-term gas production behavior for a production period of 5 y, and investigated the effect of the production intervals on the processes of hydrate dissociation and gas production. The simulation results indicated that most of the released gas from hydrate dissociation was actually produced indirectly in the aqueous phase rather than directly in the gas phase, and the proper utilization of the packers on the wellbore could effectively promote gas production, but also caused excess water production.

However, their extensive utilization leads to a shortage and environmental pollution. Recently, submarine and permafrost gas hydrate deposits have been investigated as a possible clean and sustainable energy source by governmental institutions, research organizations, and energy industries in China. The primary objective of this paper is to review the potential studies pertaining to gas hydrate exploration and resource assessment, the safe and efficient exploitation of gas hydrates and the basic properties of gas hydrates. To date, there are over 20 institutions and organizations in China committed to gas hydrate investigation, among which the Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey (GMGS) and the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences (CAGS) etc. primarily focus on gas hydrate exploration research, while the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) Research Center, Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion (GIEC) and China University of Petroleum-Beijing (CUPB) etc. concentrate on gas hydrate mining technologies. In this paper, the occurrence and exploration of gas hydrates in both permafrost regions and the continental slope of China have been determined from numerous research contributions and are presented. Moreover, the latest progress in gas hydrate fundamental studies, including hydrate phase equilibria, hydrate formation mechanisms, hydrate thermal physical properties and the acoustics and resistivity characteristics of gas hydrates are briefly reviewed, and relevant data are gathered and compared. Emphasis is also placed on gas hydrate mining technologies and gas production using depressurization methods, thermal stimulation methods or other methods. Furthermore, the security of natural gas hydrate-bearing sediments during gas production and the environmental impacts of gas hydrate are identified. With additional financial and political support and advanced research facilities, research on gas hydrates in China is progressing rapidly but is still in its early developing stage, thus, future work should be undertaken with greater diligence.

Presalt areas require deeper wells, pipes more resistant to internal and external pressures, high temperatures and also to corrosive environment. This scenario requested the development of new steel grades and new designs for threaded connections, thus increasing chips formation and the difficulty to break them. It brought issues for conveyors maintenance and safety risks for machine operators. Despite this period of intensive development in the oil and gas market, only a few studies for chip breakers specifically designed for this application have been conducted. In general, pipe manufacturers buy chip breakers from off-the-shelf, i. e. chip breakers that were not designed for this segment, thus not providing optimum results. This work is concerned with the development of a chip breaker, based on the rake face wear of the threading tool. The approach is to change the distance of the chip breaker from the cutting edge. Four developed chip breakers and a commercial one were tested. During the tests, cutting speed, depth of cut and allowance were varied in order to assess their impact on chip breaking effectiveness and work piece quality. The results show that the closer the chip breaker to the cutting edge, the more efficient they were in breaking the chips, the allowance had not any influence and depth of cut was the most influent factor thread quality.

It has excellent hydrocarbon potential, with the prospective sedimentary basin area measuring approximately 19,000 km(2) and it is considered as the most prolific oil province rift basin in Africa and the Middle East. This basin contains more than 80 oil fields, with reserves ranging from 1350 to less than I million bbl in reservoirs of Precambrian to Quaternary age The,. lithostratigraphic units in the Gulf of Suez can be subdivided into three megasequences: a prerift succession (pre-Miocene or Paleozoic-Eocene), a synrift succession (Oligocene-Miocene), and a postrift succession (post-Miocene or Pliocene-Holocene). These units vary in lithology thickness areal distribution depositional environment, and hydrocarbon importance. Geological and geophysical data show that the northern and central Gulf of Suez consist of several narrow, elongated depositional troughs, whereas the southern part is dominated by a tilt-block terrane, containing numerous offset linear highs.Major prerift and synrift source rocks have potential to yield oil and/or gas and are mature enough in the deep kitchens to generate hydrocarbons. Geochemical parameters, sterane distribution, and biomarker correlations are consistent with oils generated from marine source rocks. Oils in the Gulf of Suez were sourced from potential source rock intervals in the prerift succession that are typically oil prone (type I), and in places oil and gas prone (type II), or are composites of more than one type (multiple types 1 11 or III for oil prone, oil and gas prone, or gas prone respectively).The reservoirs can be classified into prerift reservoirs such as, the Precambrian granitic rocks Paleozoic-Cretaceous Nubian sand, stones, Upper Cretaceous Nezzazat sandstones and the fractured Eocene Thebes limestone; and synrift reservoirs such the Miocene sandstones and carbonates of the Nukhul Rudeis Kareem and Belayim formations and the sandstones of South Gharib, Zeit, and post-Zeit. The majority of oil fields in the region incorporate multiple productive reservoirs. Miocene evaporites are the ultimate hydrocarbon seals, whereas the shale and dense limestones of the prerift and the synrift stratigraphic units are the primary seals. Structural, stratigraphic, and combination traps are encountered in the study area. The Gulf of Suez is the most prolific and prospective oil province in Egypt, and any open acreage, or relinquished area, will be of great interest to the oil industry.",,,,,,,,,157,11,1,0,9,0,172,,,0149-1423,,,,,,,,,,,"United Arab Emirates Univ, Fac Sci, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000180480300008,,

There are two ways to mitigate these changes, by maintaining the greenhouse gasses below the carbon budget and by conserving the marine and terrestrial vegetation for carbon sequestration. These two strategies become variable to the carbon sequestration index (CSI) that represents the potential of a region in carbon sequestration, according to its natural capacity. As a study case, we conducted carbon sequestration research in Bintan region (Bintan Island and its surrounding), Riau Archipelago province. This research was aimed to assess the CSI and its possibility for climate change mitigation. We observed carbon sequestration of seagrass meadows and mangrove, greenhouse gas (CO2) emission (correlated to population growth, the increase of vehicles), and CSI. Bintan region has 125,849.9 ha of vegetation area and 14,879.6 ha of terrestrial and marine vegetation area, respectively. Both vegetation areas are able to sequester 0.262 Tg C yr(-1) in total and marine vegetation contributes about 77.1%. Total CO2 emission in Bintan region is up to 0.273 Tg C yr(-1), produced by transportation, industry and land use sectors. Therefore, CSI of the Bintan region is 0.98, which is above the global average (i.e. 0.58). This value demonstrates that the degree of sequestration is comparable to the total carbon emission.

The standard acid maceration technique, palynofacies description as well as palynomorph colour index chart systematically compared to thermal alteration index and vitrinite reflectance index values were utilized for the study.The palynofacies components of the Imo Formation is dominant of yellow and brown amorphous organic matter, marine taxa, opaque particles, with few dark brown structured phytoclasts and terrestrial microflora. The source rock content is interpreted as Kerogen Type II - oil prone with abundant marine palynomorphs, amorphous organic matter and few terrestrial microfossils. The spore/pollen colour of the strata is light brown signifying mature and oil generation zone. This correlates to thermal alteration index (TAI) 2+ to 3 and vitrinite reflectance index (%R-0) values of 0.5% to 1.0%.The abundance of the amorphous organic matter of marine origin suggests good source rock which indicates good oil shale prospects. The oil shale prospects of the Imo Formation in the study area are hindered by the low abundance of the palynofacies associations. Field evidence indicate that the grey to slightly light grey shales in hand specimen, as against black carbonaceous shales rich in organic matter suggests that the environmental conditions affected the quality of the organic kerogen. The oil yields may be compensated by the great volume of marine shale deposited in the formation and the abundance of amorphous organic matter of marine origin which is known to be an excellent indicator of oil. The palynofacies model enhances the understanding of palynofacies events and oil shale quality which can be tied to the development of unconventional oil shale, oil fields and subsequent exploration drive in the area.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,0016-7622,0974-6889,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Nigeria, Dept Geol, Nsukka, Nigeria",,,,2018-10-16,WOS:000446519000017,,

Ecological risk assessment involves analysis of a release (oil), its fate, and dispersion, and the exposure and intake of the contaminant to different receptors. Exposure analysis is a key step of the detailed ecological risk assessment, which involves the evaluation of the concentration and persistence of released pollutants in the media of contact. In the present study, a multimedia fate and transport model is presented, which is developed using a fugacity-based approach. This model considers four media: air, water, sediment, and ice. The output of the model is the concentration of oil (surrogate hydrocarbons-naphthalene) in these four media, which constitutes the potential exposure to receptors. The concentration profiles can subsequently be used to estimate ecological risk thereby providing guidance to policies for Arctic shipping operations, ship design, and ecological response measures.

This study investigates the spatial and temporal variability of SGD during different hydroclimatic conditions in a semi-arid, anthropogenically disturbed estuary using Darcy's law (i.e., fresh/terrestrial SGD) and radon (Rn-222, total SGD) and radium (Ra-226, saline/recirculated SGD) isotope mass balances. Continuous electrical resistivity imaging and Rn-222 surveys revealed potential subsurface influences on SGD with the highest SGD rates in areas with sandier substrates and near transitions from low hydraulic conductivity to higher hydraulic conductivity bottom sediments. Darcy estimates ranged over two orders of magnitude and were slightly higher following the flooding recession (0.09-8.28 m.d(-1)) than following a period of low precipitation (-0.02-7.84 m.d(-1)). Mobile continuous Rn-222 estimates (0.79-1.81 m.d(-1)) support higher and more variable SGD rates, similar trends to those previously reported from time-series Rn-222 measurements (0.13-3.85 m.d(-1) across seasons). Radium-226 derived SGD (1.3 x 10(-2)-2.7 x(-2) m.d(-1 )using the average groundwater endmember) fall short of Rn-222-derived SGD due to inability to account for radium tracer reactivity within the sediment. However, local Darcy estimates agree well with the range of Rn-222, likely due to the steeper gradients near shore. Radium activity ratios and SGD rates reflect mixing of shallow and deep groundwater beneath the bay, likely due to anthropogenic disturbances with a greater influence from deep groundwater 3-6 months following major precipitation events. This study strongly suggests that semi-arid systems receive significant SGD, which in highly anthro-pogenically disturbed systems are derived from both shallower and deeper groundwater flowpaths and lag the climatic conditions by weeks (shallow inputs) and months or longer (deeper inputs).",,,,,,,,,16,2,0,0,12,0,18,,,0022-1694,1879-2707,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USACoastal Carolina Univ, Conway, SC 29528 USA",,,,2020-02-27,WOS:000509620900060,,

Rich MEG is processed in MEG Recovery Units (MRU) to be recovered as Lean MEG returned to well-heads. In offshore rigs, besides determining energy requirements, the assessment of energy degradation is also important, which can be done by Exergy Analysis. In this work, an exergy formulation is developed and three technologies of offshore MRUs are assessed. Since exergy is a property that depends on the definition of a reference environment reservoir (RER), Exergy Analysis is performed via two RER approaches, both presenting consistent results. Approach #1 prescribes the usual standard atmosphere, with the addend that it is saturated by equilibrium with an infinite body of liquid water and MEG is in chemical equilibrium with air species. Since MEG is spontaneously oxidable, this entails very high exergy flows for MRU streams with MEG. As MEG is practically conserved, high exergy efficiencies result for all MRUs hindering their discrimination. Approach #2 prescribes also the standard atmosphere in equilibrium with liquid water containing MEG at infinite dilution, but not in chemical equilibrium with air. The MEG condition in MRU streams is now more akin with the MEG state in this RER, resulting that MEG streams have lower magnitude of exergy flow, leading to realistic exergy efficiencies that allow MRU discrimination. The underlying reason is that the input exergy flows now have magnitude comparable with exergy losses. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Since 1980, the summer Arctic sea ice has decreased by more than 50%. This now accessible Arctic Ocean has attracted many industries to the region such as oil and gas, fishing, and tourism. There is also the prospect of new shorter shipping routes, bypassing the Suez or Panama Canals in favor of the now open Arctic Ocean. This harsh environment and remote reaches necessitate the highest levels of safety both at sea and in the air. This secluded setting has limited infrastructure, lending itself to a space-based architecture for achieving navigation safety based on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS).GNSS integrity can be achieved via Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) as well as Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM). Here we examine both in the context of aviation and maritime navigation requirements. SBAS relies on ground-based and space-based infrastructure. ARAIM, planned for 2029, is more self-contained and will rely on the multitude of frequencies and core constellations coming in the future. Single frequency GPS-only SBAS is available today in North America, Europe, Japan, and India but falls short in the Arctic. By 2021, more systems are expected to come online, enabling service in Russia, South Korea, and China. It is 2026, which brings multi-frequency and multi-constellation to SBAS, that holds the key to enabling service in the Arctic. The existing ground infrastructure was found to be sufficient, though the geostationary (GEO) space segment was not. GEOs have a coverage limit of 72 degrees N, falling short in the Arctic.Here we propose the Japanese Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) to deliver SBAS corrections to the Arctic. With such a link in place, SBAS can enable aircraft precision approach and even precise maritime operations such as mapping. ARAIM was also found able to support aircraft precision approach and autonomous ice navigation at sea, but falls short of the precision maritime requirements. Thus, depending on the application at hand, ARAIM or SBAS may present the better option, though both have their individual merits in the Arctic.",,,,,28th International Technical Meeting of The Satellite-Division-of-the-Institute-of-Navigation (ION GNSS+)28th International Technical Meeting of The Satellite-Division-of-the-Institute-of-Navigation (ION GNSS+),"SEP 14-18, 2015SEP 14-18, 2015","Inst Navigat, Satellite DivInst Navigat, Satellite Div","Tampa, FLTampa, FL",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,2331-5911,2331-5954,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Stanford Univ, Dept Aeronaut & Astronaut, GPS Res Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USAStanford Univ, Aeronaut & Astronaut, Stanford, CA 94305 USAStanford Univ, Sch Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000375211601050,,

The idea is to improve computational efficiency and transparency of a solution. The contribution lies in the application of the Dantzig-Wolfe method which allows us to efficiently decompose an optimization problem into parts. Moreover, we show how the algorithm can be parallelized for even higher efficiency. The nonlinear system is modeled by piecewise linear models with the added benefit that error bounds can be computed. In this context alternative parameterizations are discussed.The properties of the method are studied by applying it to a model of a complex petroleum field with severe production optimization challenges due to rate dependent gas-coning wells. The model resembles the Troll west oil rim, a huge gas and oil field on the Norwegian Continental shelf.Finally, the paper discusses workflows in production optimization as a means to explain how the proposed methodology can be applied in practice.

These projects are associated with the development of key zones in the Arctic and involve the exploration for and production of minerals (diamonds, gold, rare-earth metals, oil, and gas) and the development of energy and infrastructure (e.g., the Northern Sea Route). Such projects, which are often carried out in territories of traditional nature management belonging to the indigenous peoples of the North, must consider their environmental and social responsibility and the preservation of the ethnic identity and culture of indigenous peoples. The extraction of mineral deposits in the Arctic and the Far North places new demands on subsoil users, related to the preservation and development of the socio-cultural environment of the indigenous peoples of the North and to the ecological rehabilitation of the area. This article presents economic and mathematical models for selecting the optimal development project options based on the pairwise comparison of investment projects and the evaluation of indigenous peoples' preferences. We investigated the investment projects' impact on traditional territories in the Arctic, including the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), in terms of socioeconomic and ethnological development, and environmental change. The suggested system of models can be used to assess the priority of projects supporting and developing the region in the mining corporation's area of responsibility. The proposed models are based on fuzzy set theory, which provides an effective assessment of the population's preferences for projects. Data are processed using the hierarchy analysis method and multivariate optimization calculations to determine the project sets at different funding levels. The creation of information-linked processing models is innovative. Indigenous people's expert assessments of the priority of projects are processed using the hierarchy analysis method to determine the coefficients of the optimization model that enables the calculation of the choice between the analyzed projects, given the allocated financial resources. This approach can be used to address issues of support for indigenous people in areas where mining and other economic development activities are taking place, especially in the Arctic region. The proposed decision-making mechanism, which includes public hearings, sociological surveys, ethnological expertise, and compensation payments to indigenous minorities of the North, facilitates the justification of optimal strategies for maintaining and developing the region, taking into account economic, ecological, social, and ethnological factors.",,,,,,,,,22,1,3,0,5,0,26,,,1873-9652,1876-4428,,,,,,,,,,"Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, 36 Stremianniy Per, Moscow 117997, RussiaKuban State Univ, 149 Stavroposkaya, Krasnodar 350040, Russia",,,,2017-12-01,WOS:000417043600008,,

The present paper focuses on the modelling of a 4-legged X-braced jacket type platform using nonlinear finite element analysis. The nonlinear effects of joint flexibility, piled foundations and geometrical imperfections on the platform behaviour are investigated. Joint flexibility is modelled by introducing rigid or flexible joints into the jacket beam element model. A hybrid model, with the critically-loaded leg and connected joints built using shell elements, is applied for the investigation of localised effects on increasing joint flexibility. The soil-pile interaction is modelled using sets of decoupled springs distributed along the piles. The geometrical imperfections, generated based on the failure modes of the platform, are introduced in the compression legs of the jacket. The platform is loaded by operational and environmental loads. The environmental loads are gradually increased until platform failure occurs. The findings of the paper indicate that incorporation of joint flexibility and piled foundations result in the reduction of platform yielding and ultimate strength. The piled foundation affects platform stiffness severely. The imperfections increase platform deformability in the elastic rage and lead to dramatic reduction of jacket base shear capacity.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1755-0777,1755-0785,,,,,,,,,,"Abertay Univ, Sch Sci Engn & Technol, Dundee, ScotlandWSP, Bridges Dept, Cardiff, S Glam, WalesDNV GL, UK Verificat Ctr, London, EnglandUniv Dundee, Sch Sci & Engn, Dundee, Scotland",WSP,,,2019-07-16,WOS:000473355600004,,

At this time the author's academic future in marketing was also unclear. He was working in the area of Technology Forecasting, a highly specialised field, not only within social policy and techno-economics, but within the then emerging field of strategic marketing and its subaltern, environmental scanning. In the spirit of The lessons of history (Baker 2006) the paper revisits scenarios generated by the author 25 years ago regarding technological futures in the offshore oil and gas industry. It draws on the premise that understanding can be gained by taking a forecast, a knowledge claim, whose tenure is now over, and revisiting it in the light of the present which at the time of making the forecast was, of course, the future. In the arts this historicising approach to a subject is a necessary conjunction to the development of knowledge on matters of creativity, judgement and interpretation. The cultivation of aesthetic sensibilities takes place through disciplinary frameworks of historicism and comparative interpretation, widely known as 'critical and contextual studies'. This paper is the product of such study. It attempts to set knowledge claims in historical and cultural context, suggesting where critical marketing can contribute. The forecasts of technological development were generated by means of an international Delphi study which was conducted during 1980-1983. The paper reflects on the passage of time and the evolution of the offshore oil and gas industry against the flux and flow of circumstance and event. It discusses localised historical accounts of where and how the original futures scenarios have been found to diverge or otherwise from what has come to pass, reflecting on the framing of uncertainty by broader socio-technical discourses. In this way the paper illuminates the indeterminate and emergent nature of uncertainty and the implications of this for our understanding of decision making in marketing management.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0267-257X,1472-1376,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Stirling, Sch Management, Div Mkt, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000210875900002,,

Soil organic carbon (SOC) is also related to soil biogeochemical factors. To understand the mechanisms of these changes in regulating SOC, it is necessary to characterize the direct and indirect effects of exotic species invasion, climate, and soil variables on SOC. We used a structural equation model to identify the key driving mechanisms of SOC storage to a depth of 1 m at 15 sites on the East China coast, where Spartina alterniflora Loisel. (S. alterniflora) invasion has significantly influenced SOC storage. The model revealed several patterns that are expected to explain the enhanced SOC storage. Spartina alterniflora invasion had a direct effect on SOC storage mainly due to its impacts on biomass production. Temperature had an important influence on SOC storage and the subsurface SOC content. SOC storage was also related to the interacting effects of S. alterniflora invasion and soil biogeochemical properties such as soil salinity, fine soil fraction, and bulk density. The relative contribution of SOC in the topsoil to SOC storage at a depth of 1 m decreased over time, while the contribution increased for the SOC below the surface. These results highlight the interactions among S. alterniflora invasion, climate, and soil properties in regulating SOC dynamics. Our results imply that the relative importance of vertical patterns to SOC storage associated with S. alterniflora invasion and temperature fluctuations will change over time.Plain Language Summary The world's largest invasion of S. alterniflora is occurring in the coastal wetlands of China. Coastal wetland soils, which are vulnerable to exotic species invasions, contain large amounts of organic carbon. The controlling mechanisms of soil organic carbon (SOC) associated with S. alterniflora invasion and climate change may be complex due to the interrelationships that exist among ecological factors. In our study, we investigated the effects of plant invasion, climate, and soils on SOC storage and its vertical distribution. We found that SOC storage was enhanced over time. Spartina alterniflora invasion had a direct effect on SOC storage mainly due to its impacts on biomass production. Temperature had an important influence on SOC storage and the subsurface SOC content. The interacting effects of S. alterniflora invasion and soil biogeochemical properties such as soil salinity, fine soil fractions, pH, and bulk density were also identified as having crucial impacts on SOC storage. Our results suggest an interesting possibility that the relative contribution of vertical patterns to the SOC pool is likely to change over the invasion period.",,,,,,,,,18,4,0,0,14,0,22,,,2169-8953,2169-8961,,,,,,,,,,"Jiangsu Normal Univ, Sch Geog Ieomat & Planning, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,,,2019-12-06,WOS:000497955300009,,

The goal of this study was to describe the combined impacts of crude oil and environmental stressors on fish larvae, a sensitive life stage. Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) larvae (< 24 h post-hatch) were exposed for 48 h to high energy water accommodated fractions (HEWAF; total PAHs 0-125 ppb) of Macondo oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill under different combinations of environmental conditions (dissolved oxygen 2, 6 ppm; temperature 20, 25, 30 degrees C; salinity 3, 10, 30 ppt). Even under optimal environmental conditions (25 degrees C, 10 ppt, 6 ppm) larval survival and development were negatively affected by PAHs, starting with the lowest concentration tested (similar to 15 ppb). Hypoxia and high temperature each increased the adverse effects of HEWAF on development and mortality. In contrast, salinity had little effect on any of the endpoints measured. Importantly, expression of the detoxifying gene cyp1a was highly induced in PAH-exposed larvae under normoxic conditions, but not under hypoxic conditions, potentially explaining the enhanced toxicity observed under hypoxia.

There are locations in deepwater where cross currents are significant (e.g., Gulf of Mexico). Out of the few models available for oil and gas behavior simulation under deepwater conditions, Johansen's [Spill Sci. Technol. Bull. 6 (2000) 103] is the only one that can take into effect the separation of gases from the main jet/plume.A strong ambient current causes a jet/plume to bend. Because gas rises faster than oil, it can separate from the bent plume. This gas separation can lower the neutral buoyancy level (NBL) of plume. Consequently, the overall trajectory of the oil droplets underwater and slicks at the water surface may vary significantly because the location of transition of the jet/plume mixing to the far-field turbulent mixing has drastically changed.In this paper, the turbulent, multi-phase (oil and gas) jet/plume in a cross-flow is modeled by using the integral Lagrangian control volume (CV) method. A comparison of the model results with the experimental data shows good agreement. A scenario for a deepwater blowout simulation shows that taking gas separation into account is very important in a bent plume. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

However, drilling and MH exploitation in marine methane hydrate-bearing sediments (MHBS) face new challenges associated with MH dissociation and complex multi-physics coupling. This study mainly focuses on wellbore stability during drilling in marine MHBS by employing a properly simplified multi-field theoretical model. The new solutions are derived analytically for the temperature, seepage pressure and stress/displacement field, considering the changes in the mechanical and physical properties of reservoirs induced by MH dissociation, as well as the partial coupling of multi-fields.The axisymmetric plane strain wellbore model is simplified, where the infinite ground is divided into three annular regions with different physical/mechanical properties. The closed-form solutions for temperature and seepage pressure fields are addressed by assuming steady-state heat transfer and fluid flow, by which we find that the temperature and pressure distribution, as well as the size of dissociated region are closely related to the relative thermal conductivity and permeability of the regions. An additional infinite region is introduced to obtain the decayed solutions of displacement. The analytical solutions agree very well with the results from finite element method (FEM) in that the conditions are completely consistent, and the analytical results qualitatively agree with experimental data and the results from numerical simulation under complex conditions. A parametric study is finally performed to investigate the influence of the relative thermal conductivity and permeability of the dissociated region on the size of the dissociated region, as well as the influence of the drilling fluid temperature/pressure and the reduction in the elastic modulus/cohesion of the dissociated region on wellbore stability.",,,,,,,,,26,4,0,0,1,0,29,,,1875-5100,2212-3865,,,,,,,,,,"Tongji Univ, Sch Aerosp Engn & Appl Mech, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R ChinaState Key Lab Disaster Reduct Civil Engn Tone Uni, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R ChinaTianjin Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",State Key Lab Disaster Reduct Civil Engn Tone Uni,,,2019-08-08,WOS:000477705400001,,

In Bohol Province, Philippines, a small coastal island community known as Banacon is one of the successful cases in mangrove reforestation. Recognizing the site's potential for a carbon sequestration project, a biomass and carbon stock assessment of mangrove trees was done. Using standard sampling techniques and allometric equations, tree carbon storage was measured across stand ages, namely 15-,20-and 40-year-old plantations. Mature natural stands were also included in the assessment. By estimate, the 40-year-old plantation has the largest carbon density with 370.7 ton ha(-1), followed by the 15- year-old plantation with 208.5 ton ha(-1), 20-year-old plantation with 149.5 ton ha(-1), and lastly by natural stand with 145.6 ton ha(-1). Overall, Banacon mangroves are in a vigorous condition of storing vast amount of carbon.

In sequence, the dynamic tensions are calculated as a function of the first-order relative movements caused by the wave and swell incidence. Also, it is proposed to use a tugboat to align the system with the waves' incidence angle in order to reduce motions and increase availability, which is confirmed by the obtained results.

J,,,,,,,,,Francis Peel,,Pathfinder Application for Oil and Gas Exploration Software,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Feb 15 2016,2016,"Objectives of the project that will follow on from the Pathfinder: Oil and gas exploration companies need to be able to predict where the edges of sand reservoir units lie in order to target exploration and development wells. This is a major problem in basins where the seafloor on which the sand was deposited was being actively deformed, especially in regions dominated by salt tectonics (e.g. the South Atlantic margins of Africa and South America, where many UK-based companies are active). This can be, literally, a hit-or-miss affair. If a well is drilled too far updip, it will miss the sand and any oil contained within it; if it is drilled too far downdip from the edge of the sand, it is likely to miss any oil that may be trapped further updip. Since exploration boreholes commonly cost more than £200 million each, a failed well represents considerable waste of money, time and natural resources. Any product or method which can help in the predictive effort is likely to be of considerable interest to such companies.Prediction is relatively straightforward when we have a very clear image of the subsurface, most commonly through reflection seismic data. In such cases we can simply see and map the reservoir units on such data. However there are many places around the world where the image obtained on seismic data is very poor and we can barely see the general shape of the structures, and the fine details such as reservoir shapes are invisible. In such places, in order to target wells to hit the reservoir unit, and to hit it in the optimum spot, we would like to have a reliable predictive tool that can use the data available to us. But there is at present no simple and effective method available to these companies. The most commonly used procedure simply assumes that the thickness of a unit of sediment (the isopach) is directly related to the shape of the seafloor at the time of deposition (the paleotopography). While this is broadly true in the most general terms, it is not an adequate or reliable method.Our product will provide a significant improvement in this prediction, using the information that is already available to exploration companies (in the form of existing wells and seismic data) to give a more reliable model of the paleotopography on the sea floor and the extent of sand reservoir units. We aim to provide a tool that is quick and effective - we recognize that it will not provide 100% prediction but it should be a significant improvement from the traditional isopach method.We therefore anticipate that our proposed Product/Services will more accurately map the paleo-topography of reservoirs and so will add value by, in broad terms:-1. De-risking the oil and gas exploratory process; and2. Reducing the number of unsuccessful drilling operations and improving the exploration success rate will save money, energy and resources that could be better deployed by the industry (e.g. employing and/or retaining staff for other projects, investment in other technologies, research and development etc.).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/N020537/1,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15369761,,

The impact is likely to depend on livestock density. Yet, few studies have tested this principle or evaluated the consistency of grazer-carbon relationships across multiple sites. We sampled four intertidal zones across 22 salt marshes along a 650 km stretch of coast in the UK to examine the impact of livestock density on globally important saltmarsh blue carbon stocks. Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts. Our work suggests that grazing effects on carbon stocks are minimal on broader scales in comparison with the influence of environmental context.

We extended the functions of the GIS so that we *n operate the database directly form the GIS with user-friendly interface. The GIS data can be analyzed very efficiently by using this system.3.We made interface software between the GIS and computer simulation codes for numerical forecast, completing an integrated system of database, GIS and numerical forecast.4.Numerical sea ice forecast code was improved by comparing the computed results with the observation n the Sea of Okhotsk. As a result, the sea ice forecast code has attained the level of operational use. Higher resolution computations, however, is required for the ocean code.5.Satellite sea ice remote sensing data were investigated. A sea ice distinction algorithm.

In the first section, this article critically examines the link between the multiple definitions of the concept of piracy and how these can explain the various incidents that occurred historically on the coast of Somalia. In the second part, we explain different types of maritime attacks and criminalities that took place in the Horn of Africa waters prior to the upsurge of piracy in late the 1990s. We argue that all attacks and criminal incidents at sea cannot be classified as piracy. We explain why incidents of piracy were rare before the Somali state was established. Finally, utilizing Collier and Hoeffler's greed and grievance theory, we seek to explain the factors that led to the emergence and spread of piracy. We contend that crime of opportunity explains in large part the motives of the pirates and their ringleaders while statelessness, poverty, illegal fishing, and toxic-waste dumping explain the initial emergence of piracy and tolerance for it among the coastal communities.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,0,8,,,1939-2206,1939-2214,,,,,,,,,,"Qatar Univ, Doha, QatarUniv Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada",,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000219510100001,,

Three quarters of the earth surface is covered with water that overlays many resources upon which our lives depend. High speed wireless underwater data communication among underwater sensors, deepwater instruments and autonomous underwater vehicles is of high importance in many applications of national interest, such as environmental ocean monitoring to predict natural disasters such as hurricanes, and offshore oil and gas drilling. However, underwater channels are highly bandlimited and the data rates of existing modems are much smaller than what is needed for effective communication and management. The project will result in a prototype underwater modem that benefits from novel vector acoustic underwater communication concepts and methods. This underwater vector modem has the unique feature of utilizing acoustic particle velocity channels for data communication, in addition to the conventional acoustic pressure channel. This feature provides the following advantages: increased data rate, improved performance, and small size modems, when compared to the leading competing underwater modems in this market space. This project addresses a number of technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. In the new vector acoustic and particle velocity communication paradigm, the underwater modem designer is facing new communication channels and transducers that are fundamentally different from those used in the past. Therefore, proper designs for different parts of the modem, including transducers and analog and digital transceivers will be developed. Analog electronics are supposed to interface with multi-channel transducers, whereas digital signal processing units are required to generate and demodulate multiple data streams. The personnel involved in this project, graduate and undergraduate students, will receive innovation, entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through working at the interface of multiple disciplines such as electro-acoustic transducers, underwater acoustics, communication and signal processing hardware/software, as well as participating in an intensive boot-camp on technology entrepreneurship. The project engages Teledyne-Benthos and Kongsberg, two leading companies whose underwater modems and autonomous underwater vehicles are sold worldwide, to assist in at-sea testing of the prototype modem developed in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality. Development of the vector acoustic high speed modem prototype will eventually allow the growth of many underwater systems and businesses whose operations have been constrained by low wireless data rates or very expensive undersea cables.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1500123,,,,,,,,New Jersey Institute of Technology,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13680107,,

Implemented at a large-scale, it provides a viable solution to harvesting and storing the modern crisis of GHGs emissions. To date, technological and economic barriers have inhibited broad-scale utilisation of mineral carbonation at industrial scales. This paper outlines the mineral carbonation process; discusses drivers and barriers of mineral carbonation deployment in Australian mining; and, finally, proposes a unique approach to commercially viable CCUS within the Australian mining industry by integrating mine waste management with mine site rehabilitation, and leveraging relationships with local coal-fired power station. This paper discusses using alkaline mine and coal-fired power station waste (fly ash, red mud, and ultramafic mine tailings, i.e., nickel, diamond, PGE (platinum group elements), and legacy asbestos mine tailings) as the feedstock for CCUS to produce environmentally benign materials, which can be used in mine reclamation. Geographical proximity of mining operations, mining waste storage facilities and coal-fired power stations in Australia are identified; and possible synergies between them are discussed. This paper demonstrates that large-scale alkaline waste production and mine site reclamation can become integrated to mechanise CCUS. Furthermore, financial liabilities associated with such waste management and site reclamation could overcome many of the current economic setbacks of retrofitting CCUS in the mining industry.

Closed containment systems (CCS) have the potential to eliminate the problems with sea lice and to reduce escapes and emissions. When closing the cages, water volumes and velocity are regulated and the identification of optimal current velocities for growth and fish welfare from sea transfer to harvest size becomes necessary. This study describes two trials with LOW (0.10-0.27 BL/s) and MODERATE (0.36-0.63 BL/s) water velocity on performance of post-smolt Atlantic salmon in CCS. In trial 1 (168 days, 10.9 degrees C, fish size: 884-3007 g and 41.5-59.0 cm), round weight increased with 219 g (p = .012) and condition factor with 0.11 (p = .016) in the MODERATE group compared with LOW group. The MODERATE group obtained specific growth rate (SGR) of 0.76 and thermal growth coefficient (TGC) of 2.75, compared to 0.72 and 2.56 in the LOW group. MODERATE water velocity was also associated with higher relative heart size (RHS) (p = .016), higher liver index (HSI) (p = .005), increased fillet yield (p <= .001) and lower levels of cathepsin activity in muscle tissue. In trial 2 (46 days, 7.1 degrees C, fish size: 327-482 g and 29.9-33.7 cm), round weight increased with 52 g (p = .019) and condition factor with 0.05 (p = .009) in the MODERATE group compared with LOW group.

Despite the priority in research and development investment to increasing CCS in past decades, industry mean CCS has fluctuated between 13 and 14% over the past 15 years with no obvious trend upward or downward. In this paper we consider limits to CCS and sucrose content in sugarcane and what may be done to address these limits. The maximum CCS in commercial cane delivered to mills in Australia appears to be about 18% and, while levels of sucrose in internode tissue measured in carefully controlled glasshouse conditions is only 3% units higher, we suggest that future efforts concentrate on the gap of 4 to 5% units between the highest observed CCS levels and the industrial average. This gap arises because of genetic responses to environmental factors and age, in contrast to a bio-physical limit to sucrose content already reached, and because of extraneous matter with little or no CCS. There is an opportunity to manage crops and select varieties that have higher CCS earlier in the season, and with better response to environmental factors reducing CCS. There is some evidence suggesting high CCS genotypes may be sensitive to factors affecting stem elongation. Moderate reductions in expansive growth will reduce cane volume and weight without sacrificing photosynthesis, leading to improved CCS. Ripeners could be re-evaluated with a better understanding of ripener, water, temperature and genotype interactions possibly using controlled conditions of the glasshouse. Reasons for the apparent limited progress in breeding programs in leading to increased industry CCS are not clear, but some suggestions are made for a re-evaluation of past approaches.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,4,0,9,,,0020-8841,,,,,,,,,,,"ATSIP, CIRO Plant Ind, Townsville, Qld, AustraliaCISRO Plant Ind, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaSucrogen Australia Pty Ltd, Kalamia Mill, Ayr, Australia",ATSIPCISRO Plant IndSucrogen Australia Pty Ltd,,,2011-12-07,WOS:000297032800038,,

The high-copper and ultra-low niobium steel provides superior HAZ toughness with medium heat input in -60-degrees-C Charpy test and -30-degrees-C CTOD test and with high input in -60-degrees-C Charpy test. Why HAZ toughness comparable to that of 490-MPa high tensile strength steel is obtained may be considered as follows. The precipitation of copper occurs much later than other precipitation-hardening elements like niobium and vanadium. Copper precipitated by tempering for strengthening goes into solid solution in the heating process of the HAZ. Copper precipitates little on cooling (and heating) during the subsequent welding thermal cycle. The embrittlement of HAZ by the precipitation hardening of copper thus does not take place.

Due to the physically fragile nature of salt water marshes, bioremediation is often proposed as an appropriate technology and nutrient amendment is often proposed as a means of accelerating biodegradation of crude oil. However, no information is currently available concerning the efficacy of in situ nutrient amendments in Gulf Coast salt marshes. An experimental crude oil spill (142 l over 100 m(2)) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of nitrogen amendment to stimulate bioremediation in a Spartina alterniflora dominated Louisiana salt marsh. A randomized complete block design with replication (n = 10) was utilized to test the hypothesis that additions of fast-release ammonium nitrate (60 g N/m(2)) and slow-release urea (30 gN/m(2)) fertilizers could enhance biodegradation of selected crude oil components in the marsh. Crude oil degradation was monitored by analyzing sediment samples for branched and unbranched alkanes over the 180-day study period. The compound/hopane ratio was used to correct for nonbiological losses. No consistent statistically significant effect of fertilizer addition on degradation rates was observed, despite success in increasing the porewater ammonium and NaCl-extractable ammonium over the time frame of the trial. Intrinsic pseudo-first order degradation rates of alkanes in all plots were substantial (0.003-0.008 day(-1)). Existing, background levels of N did not appear to limit biodegradation rates in Spartina-dominated salt marshes.

Significant induction of filamental chloride cells (CCs) [i.e. increases in CC fractional area and in the volume density of CCs], concomitant with significant reduction of blood osmolality, were found in C. marina treated fish. To verify whether the toxicity of C. marina was mediated through oxidative stress, a hydrogen peroxide exposure experiment was carried out and the toxicity as well as cytological and physiological changes were compared with the C. marina treatment. Hydrogen peroxide at a concentration of 500 mu M H2O2, (i.e. 25 times higher than that produced by 8000 cells/ml of C. marina (20 mu M H2O2)) was unable to induce similar CC alterations and osmoregulatory impairment in fish as observed in the C. marina treatment. Non-specific membrane damage such as severe loss of microvilli projections on the CC apical opening and rupture of epithelial membranes in the lamellae were observed. The LT50 was 6 h, two times longer than that with 8000 cells/ml of C. marina. Based on the cytological and physiological evidence and toxicity data, the mechanism by which C. marina kills fish appears to be very different from that caused by H2O2/ROS.

The rate of body mass loss during fasting is probably related to internal parameters such as initial body mass and blubber thickness, hormonal and reproductive state, and anxiety and activity levels, as well as to environmental parameters such as water and air temperature. Reduced blubber thickness causes reduced insulation which, in turn, increases heat loss to the environment. If blubber cannot be replenished by eating extra food, porpoises' fitness may decline, which may eventually result in hypothermia and pneumonia To increase understanding of the effects of fasting, the body condition of two captive porpoises was quantified while they were kept under ambient temperature conditions similar to those experienced by wild conspecifics in the North Sea, and while they were near-fasting (i.e., almost fasting) for 24 hours (consuming 3 to 10% of the average daily food intake of their normal ration in each period). Replicated near-fasting periods took place during each of the four seasons of the year, and body mass (an indicator of body condition) declined in all 30 near-fasting periods (15 for each animal). For both porpoises in all seasons, body mass loss represented approximately 4% of initial body mass (of which -0.7% was due to loss of food in the alimentary canal). Blubber thickness was difficult to quantify due to low measurement accuracy in relation to loss, but small decreases in blubber thickness (0 to 3 mm) occurred. A linear mixed-effects model showed that mass loss was greatest overall in autumn, lowest in summer, and intermediate in winter and spring. Harbor porpoises, therefore, appear to be most vulnerable to the effects of fasting due to disturbance in autumn, perhaps because their blubber layer has to increase in autumn to cope with the decreasing water temperature.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,15,0,19,,,0167-5427,,,,,,,,,,,"Sea Mammal Res Co SEAMARCO, Julianalaan 46, NL-3843 CC Harderwijk, NetherlandsDotmoth, 1 Mendip Villas,Crabtree Lane, Bristol BS41 8LN, Avon, England",Sea Mammal Res Co SEAMARCODotmoth,,,2019-01-25,WOS:000455564300005,,

One approach is based on the changes in carbon that result from changes in land use (conversion of forest to agricultural land, abandonment of agricultural land, harvest and regrowth). The other approach uses measurements of forest biomass obtained through forests inventories to determine change directly. These latter studies may also calculate changes in the amount of carbon stored in wood products and soil, but in this respect the two approaches are similar. If a significant fraction of the missing carbon sink is to be found in mid-latitude forests, one would expect direct measurement of biomass to show greater accumulations of carbon than analyses in which calculated accumulations result only from regrowth following previous harvests or abandonment of agricultural land. Data from Canada, the conterminous US, Europe, and the former USSR show this circumstance to be correct. Accumulations of carbon in biomass and soil are 0.8 PgC yr(-1) greater than expected from past management practices (land-use change). In the tropics (where forest inventories are rare), the total net flux of carbon from changes in land use (1.6 PgC yr(-1)) is consistent with recent estimates of Bur based on atmospheric data, but the geographic distribution of the flux is not the same. Globally, terrestrial ecosystems are calculated to have been a net source of 0.8 +/- 0.6 PgC yr(-1) during the 1980s.",,,,,"Symposium on the Breathing of the Earth - Observational Constraints for Models of the Terrestrial Biosphere, at the IUGG XXI General AssemblySymposium on the Breathing of the Earth - Observational Constraints for Models of the Terrestrial Biosphere, at the IUGG XXI General Assembly","JUL 02-14, 1995JUL 02-14, 1995",IUGGIUGG,"BOULDER, COBOULDER, CO",63,21,0,0,12,0,84,,,0280-6509,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-09-01,WOS:A1996VP64200002,,

As a typical open coastal wetland, large-scale human activities (e.g., tidal reclamation, fishery activities, wind farm construction, and port construction) have substantially affected the evolution of the coastal ecological environment. Previous landscape ecological risk assessment studies have documented the effectiveness of assessing the quality of ecological environment processes. However, these studies have either focused on the noncoastal zone, or they have not considered the evolution of the spatial characteristics and ecological risk evolution of the landscape at an optimal scale. Here, we present a landscape ecological risk pattern (LERP) evolution model, based on two successive steps: first, we constructed an optimal scale method with an appropriate extent and grain using multi-temporal Landsat TM/OLI images acquired in the years 2000, 2004, 2008, 2013 and 2017, and then we calculated landscape ecological risk indices. Based on this model, the entire process of the spatiotemporal evolution of ecological risk patterns of the open coastal wetlands in Jiangsu, China, was determined. The principal findings are as follows: (1) The main landscape types in the study area are tidal flats and farmland, and the main features of the landscape evolution are a significant increase in aquafarming and a substantial decrease in the tidal flat area, while the landscape heterogeneity increased; (2) In the past 20 years, the areas of low and relatively low ecological risk in the study region were greatly reduced, while the areas of medium, relatively high, and high ecological risk greatly increased; the areas of high-grade ecological risk areas are mainly around Dongtai and Dafeng; (3) The area of ecological risk from low-grade to high-grade occupied 71.75% of the study area during 2000-2017. During the previous periods (2000-2004 and 2004-2008), the areas of low-grade ecological risk were transformed to areas of middle-grade ecological risk area, while during the later periods (2008-2013 and 2013-2017) there was a substantial increase in the proportion of areas of high-grade ecological risk.

Because of the logistical, operational, and environmental differences and the footprint and required weight needed for additional injection and production equipment, offshore chemical EOR processes are challenged by greater complexity and costs as compared with onshore applications of the same technologies.Chemical EOR commonly requires large volumes of injection chemicals, as well as demulsifiers to break produced-water/oil emulsions and inhibitors to control scale, resulting in high shipment and storage costs. The use of seawater and/or produced water for injection of the chemicals into offshore fields mandates stringent processing of both streams to allow optimal injectivity, sweep efficiency, and chemical effectiveness in the reservoir. Offshore production of saleable oil and clean water requires space- and weight-efficient oil/water-separation equipment. Currently, conventional methods for processing produced fluids fall short in both efficiency and compactness. High offshore drilling costs lead to relatively large well spacing and more difficulty in monitoring the EOR subsurface process, and lead to restrictions on the number of disposal wells. Finally, environmental restrictions limit the overboarding of toxic or poorly biodegradable FOR chemicals.The industry is currently investigating the limiting factors pertinent to offshore chemical EOR. As a result of these efforts, new enabling chemistries and technologies are being examined for improving surface operations to allow cost-effective offshore chemical EOR to be performed in an environmentally sound and safe manner. Some of these recent chemical- and fluids-processing developments are described in this paper.

Several countries involving Japan, Canada, India and China have launched national projects on the exploration and exploitation of gas hydrate resources. At the beginning of this century, an early trial production of hydrate resources was carried out in Mallik permafrost region, Canada. Japan has conducted the first field test from marine hydrates in 2013, followed by another trial in 2017. China also made its first trial production from marine hydrate sediments in 2017. Yet the low production efficiency, ice/hydrate regeneration, and sand problems are still commonly encountered; the worldwide progress is far before commercialization. Up to now, many gas production techniques have been proposed, and a few of them have been adopted in the field production tests. Nevertheless, hardly any method appears really promising; each of them shows limitations at certain conditions. Therefore, further efforts should be made on the economic efficiency as well as sustainability and environmental impacts. In this paper, the investigations on NGH exploitation techniques are comprehensively reviewed, involving depressurization, thermal stimulation, chemical inhibitor injection, CO2-CH4 exchange, their combinations, and some novel techniques. The behavior of each method and its further potential in the field test are discussed. The advantages and limitations of laboratory studies are also analyzed. The work could give some guidance in the future formulation of exploitation scheme and evaluation of gas production behavior from hydrate reservoirs.

Risk models have generally concentrated upon technical failures, which are easier to construct and for which there is more concrete data. The primary causes lie firmly rooted in the culture of the organization and determine the way in which individuals go about risky activities. Modelling human activities, especially collectively rather than individual human errors as is done in most human models, is a quite different proposition, in which complex interactions between different individuals and levels change over time as success and failure alter the pattern of payoffs.This paper examines the development of a dynamic integrated model for risk in a real-time environment for the hydrocarbon industry. It is based originally on the CATS model for commercial aviation safety, which first attempted to address some of these problems in a relatively simple way. Aviation is, however, a relatively simple activity, with large numbers of common components in a constrained environment. The Oil and Gas industry is significantly more diverse, covering the gamut from exploration, drilling, production, transport, refining and chemical production, each with its own potential for large scale disaster, but in the case of an integrated oil company all run by individuals within a common company culture.

Oil-spill-models play an important role in susceptibility assessment by estimating oil-spill trajectories in this gulf. These trajectories are affected by factors that vary with time on a regional or basin scale. However, these factors are typically assumed to be constant in most oil-spill-models. Their determination is challenging due to the influence of current dynamics, tidal cycles and other related environmental parameters. Particular attention should be paid to the role of wind in the regional parameterisation of oil-spill-models, since it is particularly sensitive to the coastal characteristics. The drifter data in the Beibu Gulf provide an effective way to evaluate the local parameters. This paper proposes a regional oil-spill-susceptibility-assessment (OSSA) method for the Beibu Gulf. The assessment makes use of an oil-spill-model, whose wind-induced factor is parameterised using the drifter data.

The site has become a useful research facility in China for studying CO2 leakage and monitoring technologies for application to geological storage sites of CO2. During an eight day period in 2014, soil gas and soil flux surveys were conducted to characterise the distribution, magnitude and likely source of the leaking CO2.Two different sampling patterns were utilised during soil flux surveys. A regular sampling grid was used to spatially map out the two high-flux zones which were located 20-50 m away from the wellhead. An irregular sampling grid, with higher sampling density in the high-flux zones, allowed for more accurate mapping of the leak distribution and estimation of total field emission rate using cubic interpolation. The total CO2 emission rate for the site was estimated at 649-1015 kgCO(2)/d and there appeared to be some degree of spatial correlation between observed CO2 fluxes and elevated surface H2O fluxes.Sixteen soil gas wells were installed across the field to test the real-time application of Romanak et al.'s (2012) process-based approach for soil gas measurements (using ratios of major soil gas components to identify the CO2 source) using a portable multi-gas analyser. Results clearly identified CO2 as being derived from one exogenous source, and are consistent with gas samples collected for laboratory analysis. Carbon-13 isotopes in the centre of each leak zone (-0.21%o and 0.22%.) indicate the underlying CO2 is likely sourced from the thermal decomposition of marine carbonates.Surface soil mineralisation (predominantly calcite) can be used to infer prior distribution of the CO2 hotspots and as a consequence highlighted plume migration of 20 m in 11 years. The broadening of the affected area beyond the wellbore at the Qinghai research site markedly increases the area that needs surveying at sufficient density to detect a leak. This challenges the role of soil gas and soil flux in a CCS monitoring and verification program for leak detection, suggesting that these techniques may be better applied for characterising the source and emission rate of a CO2 leak, respectively.

The current study evaluates and discusses the palynology and palynofacies of the elastic succession of the Kharita Formation (Albian) in one of the most petroliferous, deep seated, fault controlled basins in the Western Desert of Egypt, the Abu Gharadig Basin. Although the focus is on the palynofacies association, the hydrocarbon potential of the Kharita Formation will also be addressed by means of organic petrology and Rock-Eval pyrolysis. Marine Cretaceous source rocks have generated substantial quantities of oil and gas in the Abu Gharadig rift Basin. Moreover, Abu Gharadig Basin is characterized by containing not only oil/gas generating source rocks but also reservoir rocks with appreciable porosities and permeabilities. Palynological, TOC/Rock-Eval pyrolysis, and vitrinite reflectance (VRo%) data from 26 cuttings samples recovered from the Kharita Formation in the BED 2-1 x well, are presented. The palynological age dating (AL-2 Palynozone) confirmed early to middle Albian age based on the first downhole appearance of the marker Concavisimisporites punctatus. The optical and visual characterization of the palynofacies associations showed two distinct palynofacies associations that alternated with each other. Kerogen type III to III/II was recorded based on the dominance of phytoclasts and opaque organics. Some intervals showed a slight dominance of amorphous organic matter (AOM). Thermal Alteration Index (TAI) values of 2 + /3-measured on the psilate trilete spores, in combination with vitrinite reflectance (VRo) values in the range from 0.51 to 0.62%, and the yellow to dull-yellow colors of the liptinite macerals exhibited under UV light excitation indicate immature to the early stage of the oil window. Tmax values from Rock-Eval pyrolysis range from 426 to 438 degrees C also confirm the low maturity of the organic matter. Thin coal stringers were recorded within the Kharita Formation having slightly higher VRo,ran values (0.64 to 0.76%), which is possibly the result of differences in mineral matrix variations within the Kharita Formation. Based on the low TOC (avg. 0.71 wt%), S-2 (avg. 0.97 mg HC/g rock), and HI (avg. 149 mg HC/g TOC) values from pyrolysis, the hydrocarbon potential of the Kharita Formation in the studied well is considered to be low.",,,,,35th Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Organic-Petrology (TSOP)35th Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Organic-Petrology (TSOP),"AUG 17-22, 2018AUG 17-22, 2018",,"Soc Organ Petrol, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINASoc Organ Petrol, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA",16,0,0,0,1,0,16,,,0166-5162,1872-7840,,,,,,,,,,"Core Labs Inc, 6316 Windfern Rd, Houston, TX 77040 USACairo Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geol, Giza 12613, EgyptAssiut Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geol, Assiut 71516, Egypt",Core Labs Inc,,,2019-06-20,WOS:000470944700003,,

An AutoCAD database was also maintained throughout the search.Target interpretation was performed by a team of search analysts to ensure multiple viewing of all data. Classification of targets was followed by detailed analysis and characterization. At this point image corrections and enhancements were performed as needed.A digital mosaic of the survey areas was created in near real time, enabling the search team to have a comprehensive picture of the entire search area.The culmination of this search was the verification on May 29, 1999 that one of the sonar contacts, in 3000m of water, was the I.N.S.

The fish were considered to be adapted to the salinities as pre-confinement plasma cortisol and glucose levels were typical for unstressed fish. Two hour net confinement increased plasma cortisol and glucose to a similar extent in both FW and SW. Individual plasma sodium and chloride levels were unaffected by confinement, although plasma Na:Cl ratio increased in FW. Confinement increased intestinal Na+/K+-ATPase activity in EW, but not in SW. In contrast, kidney Na+/K+-ATPase activity increased in SW only. Branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity decreased with confinement in SW, but not in FW. In SW, confinement reduced the numbers of opercular chloride cells. Increased aging of the branchial chloride cell (CC) population of SW-confined fish was indicated by large numbers of apoptotic CCs in the interlamellar areas. This effect on the CC population was absent in FW-confined fish. Overall, confinement in SW-adapted fish had a more profound impact than confinement in FW-adapted fish. This is likely to have associated energetic consequences in terms of branchial oxygen and ATP consumption. Therefore, results suggest the possibility of different effects of confinement on subsequent growth in FW and SW. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The input data and results from the model were verified using data available in the literature. Seasonal sea ice played a major role in containing PAH exposure and subsequent risk to polar cod.

All captured CO2 in excess of that needed for EOR is sequestered in saline formations at the same geographic locations as the oil reservoirs but at a different depth. We analyze the extraction of oil from the same set of ten reservoirs within 20- and five-year time frames to describe how the scale of the carbon dioxide capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) network changes to meet the rate of CO2 demand for oil recovery. Our analysis shows that there is a negative system-wide net present value (NPV) for all modeled scenarios. The system comes close to breakeven economics when capturing CO2 from three coal-fired power plants to produce oil via CO2-EOR over 20 years and assuming no CO2 emissions penalty. The NPV drops when we consider a larger network to produce oil more quickly (21 coal-fired generators with CO2 capture to produce 80% of the oil within five years). Upon applying a CO2 emissions penalty of 60$2009/tCO(2) to fossil fuel emissions to ensure that coal-fired power plants with CO2 capture remain in baseload operation, the system economics drop significantly.

During the past 1.6million years, approximately 800meters of sandy turbidites and hemipelagic mud were deposited near the distal edge of the forearc basin, at Site C0002 of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. Constant-rate-of-strain consolidation tests yield estimates of in situ permeability that range from 2.6x1017m2 to 2.5x1018m2; overconsolidation ratios range from 1.7 to 2.6, and values of the compression index range from 0.39 to 0.78. Several processes contributed to the apparent overconsolidation. Strata dip toward land, and pore fluids probably migrate up-dip and vent along a bathymetric notch near the seaward edge of the basin. Efficient lateral drainage through sandy turbidites has kept pore pressures within interbeds of mudstone at (or close to) hydrostatic. In addition, alteration of dispersed volcanic glass, precipitation of authigenic clay minerals, and collapse of random grain fabric has probably strengthened the bonding among grains. Cementation is particularly likely within the lower basin (unit III), where values of porosity remain anomalously high. If fluid overpressures (and underconsolidation) exist anywhere within the basin, the most likely loci are where sandy turbidites terminate against impermeable mudstones along landward-dipping on-lap surfaces. Those types of on-lap geometries, in addition to structural closures, might provide promising targets for oil/gas accumulation in other forearc basins, particularly where petroleum source rocks have been buried to the optimal depths of catagenesis.",,,,,,,,,13,1,0,0,0,0,15,,,1525-2027,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Missouri, Dept Geol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USAUniv Missouri, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Columbia, MO 65211 USAPenn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,,,2013-06-26,WOS:000319410100017,,

We observed significant reductions in production and viability of Acinetobacter and Marinobacter in the presence of the dispersant compared to controls. Of the organisms examined, Marinobacter appears to be the most sensitive to the dispersant, with nearly 100% reduction in viability and production as a result of exposure to concentrations of the dispersant likely to be encountered during the response to the spill (1 to 10 mg ml-1). Significantly, at the same concentration of dispersant, the non-hydrocarbon-degrading Vibrio isolates proliferated.

The Future Energy Scenario Assessment (FESA) software model used for this study is unique in providing a holistic, high resolution, functional analysis, which incorporates variations in supply resulting from weather-dependent renewable energy generators. The outputs of this model, arising from any given user-definable scenario, are year round supply and demand profiles that can be used to assess the market size and operational regime of energy technologies. FESA was used in this case to assess what - if anything - might be the role for hydrogen in a low carbon economy future for the UK.In this study, three UK energy supply pathways were considered, all of which reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, and substantially reduce reliance on oil and gas while maintaining a stable electricity grid and meeting the energy needs of a modern economy. All use more nuclear power and renewable energy of all kinds than today's system. The first of these scenarios relies on substantial amounts of 'clean coal' in combination with intermittent renewable energy sources by year the 2050. The second uses twice as much intermittent renewable energy as the first and virtually no coal. The third uses 2.5 times as much nuclear power as the first and virtually no coal.All scenarios clearly indicate that the use of hydrogen in the transport sector is important in reducing distributed carbon emissions that cannot easily be mitigated by Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). In the first scenario, this hydrogen derives mainly from steam reformation of fossil fuels (principally coal), whereas in the second and third scenarios, hydrogen is made mainly by electrolysis using variable surpluses of low-carbon electricity. Hydrogen thereby fulfils a double facetted role of Demand Side Management (DSM) for the electricity grid and the provision of a 'clean' fuel, predominantly for the transport sector. When each of the scenarios was examined without the use of hydrogen as a transport fuel, substantially larger amounts of primary energy were required in the form of imported coal.The FESA model also indicates that the challenge of grid balancing is not a valid reason for limiting the amount of intermittent renewable energy generated. Engineering limitations, economic viability, local environmental considerations and conflicting uses of land and sea may limit the amount of renewable energy available, but there is no practical limit to the conversion of this energy into whatever is required, be it electricity, heat, motive power or chemical feedstocks.

Coastal wetlands serve a vital role in global carbon cycles; thus, it is important to understand the impacts of wetland creation on carbon storage functions. Carbon emissions and accumulation in wetlands are reported to be highly site-specific depending on factors such as salinity, plant type and productivity, and water table. This study investigated the effects of different salinities (<2 parts per thousand, similar to 5%. and >10 parts per thousand) on greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration of created wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary. CH4 emissions significantly declined with increasing salinity, likely because of the higher sediment sulfate content at higher salinities. CO2 emissions were highest at intermediate salinities (similar to 5 parts per thousand). In unvegetated sites, the absolute CO2 emission equivalent was 0.178 kg m(-2) y(-1) in the <2 parts per thousand salinity treatment, which was 8.09 times higher than the >10 parts per thousand salinity treatment. In vegetated sites, the <2 parts per thousand salinity treatment had the highest annual net flux of carbon. Thus, despite the high carbon emission of low salinity wetland, enhanced plant productivity resulted in a high carbon absorption rate. Overall, these results demonstrate that the presence of vegetation altered the effects of salinity on carbon equivalency in created wetlands. This study suggests that to conserve the wetland carbon sink function, landscape design for wetland restoration in estuarine regions should consider creating open water wetland in high salinity regions and restoring vegetation in low salinity regions to facilitate the growth of macrophytes such as Phragmites australis.

Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is one of the most commonly used MCDM methods, which integrates subjective and personal preferences in performing analyses. AHP works on a premise that decision-making of complex problems can be handled by structuring the complex problem into a simple and comprehensible hierarchical structure. However, AHP involves human subjectivity, which introduces vagueness type uncertainty and necessitates the use of decision-making under uncertainty. In this paper, vagueness type uncertainty is considered using fuzzy-based techniques. The traditional AHP is modified to fuzzy AHP using fuzzy arithmetic operations. The concept of risk attitude and associated confidence of a decision maker on the estimates of pairwise comparisons are also discussed. The methodology of the proposed technique is built on a hypothetical example and its efficacy is demonstrated through an application dealing with the selection of drilling fluid/mud for offshore oil and gas operations.",,,,,,,,,146,2,0,0,26,2,155,,,1436-3240,1436-3259,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Res Council Canada, Inst Res Construct, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada",,,,2006-11-01,WOS:000240982700004,,

By 2006, more than half of the wells had ceased to flow, and many were flowing intermittently. With ailing wells and consequently falling production rates, the longer-term future for Ravenspurn North field was uncertain.A wireline campaign suggested a common failure mode for many wells: Large amounts of proppant had accumulated in the wellbore. Modeling of the potential range of static and dynamic pressure losses caused by this proppant supported a significant enhancement to the remaining gas potential. However, the depths of the wells combined with subhydrostatic pressure conditions and large-diameter lower completions made achieving cleanout challenging. Furthermore, the target wells were located on unmanned offshore installations with minimal facilities, deck space, and deck loading.This paper details how each of these obstacles was successfully tackled to reinstate a target set of wells. It describes the various cleanout options that were considered, and why concentric-coiled-tubing vacuum technology (CCTVT) was ultimately selected. Before this project, CCTVT had never been deployed in the North Sea, and nowhere in the world at these reservoir depths. The operation was delivered on the small unmanned installation by conducting the world's first boat-spooling operation of concentric coiled tubing (CCT); rigorously reassessing deck loadings; and running the operation completely self-sufficiently, with a maximum of 10 personnel onboard.Finally, this paper provides a detailed description of the successful CCTVT operations that recovered a total of 2,950 lbm of proppant from three wells to expose the perforations and unload the wells of liquid. Furthermore, CCT was used to mill out tubing-profile nipples and install a packer to hang off 1,200 ft of flush-joint tail pipe. Innovative thinking and close collaboration between operator and service companies were required, because the ability to perform multiple operations on CCT was in itself pioneering.Overall, this campaign has pushed the boundaries of intervention technology to deliver an extremely challenging project. This has resulted in a more-certain future for the Ravenspurn North field, as well as newly unlocked opportunities in deep depleted gas wells worldwide.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1930-1855,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012-04-04,WOS:000301328900006,,

We conducted a manipulative field experiment to test the effects of loud, LF noise on foraging fin blue (B. musculus) and (Balaenoptera physalus) whales off San Nicolas Island, California. Naive observers used a combination of attached tracking devices, ship-based surveys, aerial surveys, photo-identification and passive monitoring of vocal behaviour to examine the behaviour and distribution of whales when a loud LF source (US Navy SURTASS LFA) was and was not transmitting. During transmission, 12-30% of the estimated received levels of LFA of whales in the study area exceeded 140 dB re 1 mua. However, whales continued to be seen foraging in the region. Overall, whale encounter rates and diving behaviour appeared to be more strongly linked to changes in prey abundance associated with oceanographic parameters than to LF sound transmissions. In some cases, whale vocal behaviour was significantly different between experimental and non-experimental periods.. However, these differences were nor consistent and did not appear to be related to LF sound transmissions. Rt the spatial and temporal scales examined, we found no obvious responses of whales to a loud, anthropogenic, LF sound.

For this purpose, we conducted dilbit (Access Western Blend; AWB and Cold Lake Blend; CLB) weathering studies for 13 days in a flume tank containing seawater. After six days of weathering, droplets detached from the AWB slick and were dense enough to sink in seawater. The density of CLB also increased, but at a slower rate compared to AWB, which was attributed to the high concentration of alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in it, which are more resistant to weathering. An empirical, Monod-type model was introduced and was found to closely simulate the increase in oil density with time. Such a model could be used within oil spill models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The magnitude of the impact of ungulates on vegetation has been debated for a long time, but quantifying such effects at the continental scale has been difficult. This study presents an attempt to estimate for the first time the potential impact of large natural ungulate grazer herds on African ecosystems.LocationThe African continent (excluding Madagascar).MethodThe potential impacts of grazing on grass biomass, competition between grasses and trees, the occurrence and effects of wildfire and biome distribution were simulated with a model that couples a physiological grazer population model with a physiological dynamic vegetation one (not including the effects of browsing). This model has previously been shown to reproduce grazer densities across African wildlife reserves.ResultsModelled grazer densities corresponded reasonably well with the continental distribution of African grazers represented by the herbivore functional types in the model. The coupled model predicted a hump-shaped relationship between annual precipitation and grazer biomass densities within a range of estimates from independent studies. In accordance with other studies, net primary productivity and the length of the dry season were the strongest predictors of grazer densities in the model. The inclusion of grazers in the model did not substantially alter an already (without grazers) reasonable fit between simulated vegetation biomass and burned area and estimates of these derived from remote sensing data. Nevertheless, the grazer-vegetation model predicted substantial impacts on grass biomass, tree biomass and burned area, particularly in areas with high grazer densities. The biome distribution at the continental scale, however, was similar with and without grazers.Main conclusionThe results suggest that natural large ungulate grazers have been important drivers of ecosystem functioning in some savanna ecosystems, but also that they do not have a large effect on the continental-scale biome distribution and carbon stocks.",,,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,24,0,39,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,,,,,,,,,"Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr Bik F, D-60325 Frankfurt, GermanySenckenberg Gesell Nat Forsch, D-60325 Frankfurt, GermanyPotsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, GermanyUniv Otago, Dept Bot, Dunedin 9054, New ZealandGoethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Phys Geog, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany",,,,2015-09-01,WOS:000359867400001,,

We propose to maximise these data to interpret the rock properties of strata where no physical sampling will take place. The Nankai Trough is located along the SW margin of Japan, and is part of a subduction zone in the western Pacific where large magnitude earthquakes (>8) have occurred repeatedly. These earthquakes pose a significant threat to people but also allow scientists to study the science of plate tectonics. IODP expeditions (314-316) will drill and sample this active plate boundary fault to (1) observe the fluids and sediments within a fault system associated with the subduction and (2) create an instrumented network to monitor earthquake activity. Sediment is deposited across the Nankai Trough area. In areas seaward of the subduction fault system, mainly undisturbed sediments, fluids and crustal rocks, will be sampled to characterise materials that will eventually be transported into the subduction zone. This sedimentary succession will be drilled at two of six sites, however, it is difficult to collect physical samples and return them to the ship for further study because many of these sediments are unstable. The continuous measurements from the strata beneath the seafloor are a 'representative' or a 'proxy' for the rock properties. We will use standard interpretation techniques, and also develop new interpretation methodologies, to use these data (electrical, nuclear, images of the rocks along the borehole sides) to deduce rock properties, e.g. rock type, presence and type of fluids and character of strata. We will be able to identify where the rock types change even where actual samples cannot be retrieved. One project deliverable is to determine how these data can be used to indicate mineralogy. Sediment mineralogy is important for determining when and where the earth's crust will fracture and generate earthquakes. Changes in the mineral content of the sediment deposited will indicate either a change in the source of sediment or in the processes which deliver sediment to a basin. Another objective is to produce a vertical column, based on these proxy data, that represents the succession of different sediments present at the drill site. This is key to understanding what control the original sediment and fluid exerts on deformation as the sediments are subducted. The project will also interpret other characteristics, such as structures produced by sediment transport or post-deposition disturbance. Even away from the subduction zone, the accumulating sediment may be disturbed by faults, which move during earthquakes, and the sediments can become unstable and 'fail' resulting in transport by slumps and slides. These transport processes will produce different structures in the sediment which will be visible on the borehole image logs. Other planned drill-sites through the fault system will measure more disturbed (deformed) sedimentary strata. We will compare results from the undisturbed sediments with data retrieved from the deformed sedimentary successions to define lithologies, mineralogies and structures at these sites also. Combining all our 'proxy' data, we will propose an overarching scheme that will group the successions into units with similar data characteristics, identify structural and fluid flow features and enable us to suggest sediment characteristics. These results will inform the planning of subsequent IODP expeditions in late 2007 and early 2008. This academic project is at the interface with applied research: the type of data collected during drilling on Expedition 314 is used by industry in exploration, and its interpretation will become increasingly important in the search for smaller oil and gas fields.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/F009593/1,,,,,,,,University of Leicester,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15332541,,

By monitoring carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions during dry and wet phases of an environmental watering event, we determined that adding water to a degraded semi-arid floodplain wetland reduces carbon emissions by 28-84%. The watering event increased anoxic levels and plant growth in the aquatic zone of the wetland, which may correlate with lower carbon emissions during and after environmental watering due to lower anaerobic microbial decomposition processes and higher CO2 sequestration by vegetation. During the watering event, areas with higher inundation had lower CO2 emissions (5.15 +/- 2.50 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)) compared to fringe areas surrounding the wetland (11.89 +/- 4.25 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)). CH4 flux was inversely correlated with CO2 emissions during inundation periods, showing a 38% (0.013 +/- 0.061 g CO2-e m(-2) day(-1)) increase when water was present in the wetland. During the dry phases of environmental watering, there was CH4 uptake within the fringe and aquatic zones (-0.013 +/- 0.063 g CO2-e m(-2) day(-1)). A clear succession of soil microbial community was observed during the dry-wet phases of the environmental watering process. This suggests that wetland hydrology plays a large role in the microbial community structure of these wetland ecosystems, and is consequently linked to CO2 and CH4 emissions. Overall, the total carbon emissions (CO2 + CH4) were reduced within the wetland during and after the environmental watering event, due to increasing vegetative growth and subsequent CO2 sequestration. We, therefore, recommend environmental watering practices in this degraded arid wetland ecosystem to improve conditions for wetland carbon sequestration and storage. Further use of this management practice may improve wetland carbon storage across other arid freshwater wetland ecosystems with similar hydrologic regimes.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,15,0,23,,,,2296-665X,,,,,,,,,,"Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Vic, Australia",,,,2020-02-07,WOS:000517177000001,,

In these circumstances, there is a real possibility of increased crack growth rates due to combined corrosion fatigue. In this way, the current paper investigates the corrosion and fatigue characteristics of Zeron 100 weld metal in synthetic seawater. High-imposed electrochemical potentials are specifically addressed, since it is well known that aerated and chlorinated seawater in contact with high alloy stainless steels give rise to high local electrochemical potentials. The corrosion resistance of the weld metal was similar to the base metal when positively polarised in synthetic seawater at ambient temperature. Crack propagation rates increased for the base and weld metal by over a factor of 2 compared to rates in laboratory air. High temperature solution significantly reduces the pitting potential and delays repassivation.

A common approach to analysis of marine organic matter uses acid to hydrolyze the glycans into measurable monosaccharides. The monosaccharides may be derived from different glycans that are built with the same monosaccharides, however, and this approach does not distinguish between glycans in natural samples. Here we use enzymes to digest selectively and thereby quantify laminarin in particulate organic matter. Environmental metaproteome data revealed carbohydrate-active enzymes from marine flavobacteria as tools for selective hydrolysis of the algal beta-glucan laminarin. The enzymes digested laminarin into glucose and oligosaccharides, which we measured with standard methods to establish the amounts of laminarin in the samples. We cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized three new glycoside hydrolases (GHs) of Formosa bacteria: two are endo-beta-1,3-glucanases, of the GH16 and GH17 families, and the other is a GH30 exo-beta-1,6-glucanase. Formosa sp. nov strain Hel1_33_131 GH30 (FbGH30) removed the beta-1,6-glucose side chains, and Formosa agariphila GH17A (FaGH17A) and FaGH16A hydrolyzed the beta-1,3-glucose backbone of laminarin. Specificity profiling with a library of glucan oligosaccharides and polysaccharides revealed that FaGH17A and FbGH30 were highly specific enzymes, while FaGH16A also hydrolyzed mixed-linked glucans with beta-1,4-glucose. Therefore, we chose the more specific FaGH17A and FbGH30 to quantify laminarin in two cultured diatoms, namely, Thalassiosira weissflogii and Thalassiosira pseudonana, and in seawater samples from the North Sea and the Arctic Ocean. Combined, these results demonstrate the potential of enzymes for faster, stereospecific, and sequence-specific analysis of select glycans in marine organic matter.IMPORTANCE Marine algae synthesize substantial amounts of the glucose polymer laminarin for energy and carbon storage. Its concentrations, rates of production by autotrophic organisms, and rates of digestion by heterotrophic organisms remain unknown. Here we present a method based on enzymes that hydrolyze laminarin and enable its quantification even in crude substrate mixtures, without purification. Compared to the commonly used acid hydrolysis, the enzymatic method presented here is faster and stereospecific and selectively cleaves laminarin in mixtures of glycans, releasing only glucose and oligosaccharides, which can be easily quantified with reducing sugar assays.",,,,,,,,,61,2,0,0,55,0,65,,,0099-2240,1098-5336,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci, Bremen, GermanyMax Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, Bremen, GermanyMax Planck Inst Mol Plant Physiol, Potsdam, GermanyMIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,,2017-05-10,WOS:000399566400004,28213541,

Although the benefits of these channels are evident from an economic perspective, the associated response of the wave climate, tidal flows, salinity intrusion, and sediment dynamics is scarcely studied. Since estuaries can be classified in several categories depending on parameter spaces dictated by hydrodynamic and morphological features, it is key to assess how the barotropic, baroclinic, and sediment dynamics respond to channel modifications in multiple urbanized systems. This dissertation focuses on the impact of channel deepening on waves, tides, and sediment transport in urbanized estuaries. The study region here is the Delaware Estuary, which has been dredged for over a century to ensure navigation into the ports of Wilmington, Philadelphia, and Trenton.First, we explore the impact of locally generated wind waves on the momentum budget and subtidal exchange in the bay. We use a numerical model to diagnose the role of wind waves on surface drag, momentum budget, and residual circulation in the estuary. Model results reveal that wave induced forces (Stokes-Coriolis, breaking, and vortex forces) did not significantly add to the mean momentum budget during a typical storm. However, when we accounted for (i) the spatially variable wave height and age in the wind stress formulation, and (ii) the wave-induced Stokes drift, we found that the subtidal bay-ocean exchange increased by about 30%. We also highlight that wind and wave direction are also critical for the magnitude of the depth-integrated exchange. Part of this study on waves included an adjustment of the wave model to prevent whitecapping wave dissipation from creating breaking forces since that contribution is already included in the wind stress. Results from this part are generalizable to young seas in estuaries where the wave field is modulated by topography. Second, we examine how historical channel deepening altered barotropic dynamics in the estuary and tidal river. Model results with historical and modern bathymetry reveal a doubling in tidal range near the head of the tides, consistent with a reduction in hydraulic drag in the shipping channel and relatively unchanged width convergence. Tidal current amplitude along the channel doubled in some areas and were strongly modulated by undulations in channel topography. Channel deepening also increased the tidal phase speed, with implications for the arrival time of high water in the system, especially in the tidal river where high water arrives about an hour earlier now than in the mid 1800s. In terms of wave dynamics, the tidal wave became more progressive after deepening and tidal energy fluxes increased. We also found that the tidal amplification caused by a doubling in channel depth is similar to the projected change in tides under 1 m of sea level rise and shoreline hardening reported recently by other authors.The last part is a modeling study on the response of turbidity and sediment fluxes (pumping and mean advection) after channel deepening. Since sediment dynamics are closely tied to density-driven circulation, first we examined the baroclinic response to channel deepening under mean river discharge. The model revealed that the salt intrusion increased by a factor of 1.3 and that the magnitude of the exchange flow increased only locally in the lower bay by no more than 25%. Areas of enhanced sediment trapping were located in the saline reaches of each modeled scenario, and at lateral bathymetric transitions from channels (main and secondary) to shoals due to the influence of salinity fronts. Channel deepening led to the landward migration of these trapping zones, consistent with the increase in salt intrusion. The mean advection of sediment closely mimics the residual circulation patterns in both the stratified and fresh segments of the system, while pumping fluxes were strongly landward in both scenarios due to the flood dominance caused by tidal distortion.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-23,DRCI:DATA2020029017933442,,

While venting and flaring is a growing concern, accounting of how much gas is vented and flared, and where this occurs, remains limited. The purpose of this paper is to describe two methods for estimating venting and flaring volumes - self-reports required by state law and satellite imagery radiant heat measurements - and to compare these methods using the case of Texas Eagle Ford and Permian Basin venting and flaring practices from 2012 to 2015. First, we used data self-reported by companies to the Texas Railroad Commission (TxRRC), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data captured by satellite-based Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensors, to estimate the annual total volumes of gas vented and flared in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin from 2012 to 2015. Next, we developed a method using a geographic information system to link and compare TxRRC and NOAA county-based and point-based volume estimates. Finally, we conducted case studies of two oil and gas fields to better understand how TxRRC and NOAA venting and flaring volumes differ. We find both TxRRC and NOAA estimated venting and/or flaring volumes steadily increased from 2012 to 2015. Additionally, TxRRC reports captured about half the volumes estimated by NOAA. This suggests that self-reported volumes significantly underestimate the volume of gas being vented or flared. However, this research is limited by the data currently available. As such, future research and policy should further develop methods to systemically capture the extent to which oil and gas extraction facilities vent and flare natural gas. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although there is uncertainty on this figure, outdoor air pollution represents one of the greatest global risks to human health. In North America, the rapid evolution of technologies (e.g. nanotechnology, unconventional oil and gas rapid development, higher demand for fertilizers in agriculture) and growing demand for ground, marine and air transportation may result in significant increases of emissions of pollutants that have not been carefully studied so far. As a result, these atmospheric pollutants insufficiently addressed by science in Canada and elsewhere are becoming a growing issue with likely human and environmental impacts in the near future. Here, an emerging pollutant is defined as one that meets the following criteria: 1) potential or demonstrated risk for humans or the environment, 2) absence of Canada-wide national standard, 3) insufficient routine monitoring, 4) yearly emissions greater than one ton in Canada, 5) insufficient data concerning significant sources, fate, and detection limit, and 6) insufficiently addressed by epidemiological studies. A new methodology to rank emerging pollutants is proposed here based on weighting multiple criteria. Some selected emerging issues are also discussed here and include the growing concern of ultrafine or nanoparticles, growing ammonia emissions (due to rapid expansion of the agriculture), increased methane/ethane/propane emissions (due to the expanding hydraulic fracturing in the oil and gas sector) and the growing transportation sector. Finally, the interaction between biological and anthropogenic pollution has been found to be a double threat for public health. Here, a multidisciplinary and critical overview of selected emerging pollutants and related critical issues is presented with a focus in Canada. Implications: This overview paper provides a selection methodology for emerging pollutants in the atmospheric environment. It also provides a critical discussion of some related issues. The ultimate objective is to inform about the need to 1) address emerging issues through adequate surface monitoring and modeling in order to inform the development of regulations, 2) reduce uncertainties by geographically mapping emerging pollutants (e.g. through data fusion, data assimilation of observations into air quality models) which can improve the scientific support of epidemiological studies and policies. This review also highlights some of the difficulties with the management of these emerging pollutants, and the need for an integrated approach.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,6,0,13,,,1096-2247,2162-2906,,,,,,,,,,"Environm & Climate Change Canada, Air Qual Res Div, Air Qual Modelling & Integrat Sect, 2121 Trans Canada Highway, Dorval, PQ H9P 1J3, Canada",,,,2020-03-19,WOS:000518359900001,31994992,

In this dissertation I argue for an environmentally minded Atlantic history, one that is conscious of the ocean as both a cultural and a physical presence. The ocean shaped an early modern Atlantic vernacular that was at its essence maritime, godly, anxious and sociable. The ocean was a conduit to empire, so anything Britons imagined about the oceans, they imagined about their empire as well. Britons could never fully master their empire because they could never master the ocean; it was source of anxiety for even the wealthiest merchants. The fear of extremity - of wreck and ruin - kept those who crossed the ocean focused on the three most valuable Atlantic commodities: a sound reputation, accurate information, and the mercy of God.To explore this four-fold Atlantic culture I examine a variety of sources, from popular songs and sermons to merchants letters. These sources expose the connection between the physical experiences that shaped British bodies and the fears and images that shaped British minds. Songs told people that the life of a sailor was one of danger, scripture told them the seas were the mouthpiece for an often angry God, and those who ventured out onto the waters came home to tell stories of overwhelming hardships. By restoring the place of the ocean in the empire, I argue for an eighteenth century that was communal rather than individualistic, religious rather than secular, shipwrecked and nerve-wracked rather than proudly imperial.

These environmental values are potentially offset by an increased fire hazard posed by revegetation. There is a need to understand the influence environmental planting has on landscape fire behavior and to determine how this changes as plantings age. This study examined how environmental values, regenerative capacity, fuel metrics, and potential fire behavior change with time since planting. We assessed 57 sites across the Albury-Wodonga region (New South Wales, Australia). This included a range of environmental planting ages (4-40 yr time since planting), remnants, and pastures. Carbon storage increased with age of planting, with largest C stores found in remnants (105 tC/ha), while habitat complexity plateaued around 20 yr, with no significant difference between moderately aged plantings (14-20 yr), old plantings (> 20 yr), and remnants. Modeled rate of fire spread was faster in pastures compared to environmental plantings and remnants. Flame height was slightly higher (0.5-1 m) in pastures than environmental plantings and remnants under a Very High Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI), but this trend reversed under Extreme and Catastrophic conditions with flame heights greatest in environmental plantings and remnants albeit with slower rates of spread. This research highlights the importance of environmental plantings in the landscape in terms of C storage and environmental values and indicates the perceived hazard associated with rate of spread and flame height may not be justified at or less than Very High FFDI. However, at FFDI greater than Very High fire behavior may be significantly enhanced in environmental plantings and remnants. Further consideration needs to be given to the size and design of plantings and the type of species planted to fully develop an understanding of the complexities of fire risk.

Interdisciplinarity nature of the Research UnitThe strategic plan of FP-ENAS brings together a complementary group of researchers from academic, clinical and industrial arenas, accommodating the skills and knowledge needed to address the complex problems of fossil energy use and effect on the environment and health.Despite important efforts to replace fossil by renewable power sources, use of fossil fuels, will remain for decades the main source of Primary Energy. Thus, fossil energy associated GHG production will require increasing introduction of Clean Technologies to mitigate emissions. It is well known, that GHG, environment quality and climate changes directly influence human health trough: i) changes in allergens; ii)food and water born microbial related diseases; iii) mice, bird and insect transmitted diseases; iv) UV related genetic diseases (hereditary or oncological); v) diseases related to pollutant and toxic concentrations in air and water. Also, health care activities are known to significantly impact on environment, with special concerns involving environmental releases of pharmaceuticals and health care disposables.Accordingly, the problems to be addressed by FP-ENAS are related with two major perspectives:(i) Economic perspectiveIt refers to the prospection, exploration and cleaner exploitation of Fossil Fuels Reservoirs. This implies best fit methods to accurately calculate Reservoir Resources and Reserves, as well as, the amounts that can be extracted, with the use of enhanced production technologies such as CO2 injection fluid (that becomes geologically stored). These methodologies are however very expensive. Thus, prior to decisions on their use, laboratory methods for modelling reservoirs must be used. Our unit is performing this through an innovative and automated “Reservoir simulator” prototype combined with the use of computer based data acquisition and modelling.(ii) Environmental and Health perspectiveEnvironmental health and Public health are largely affected by fossil fuel use, Climate changes and the GHG resulting in the need to promote, CO2 abatement through Carbon Capture and Storage. These are indeed the only technologies currently able to conform to the ambitious EU targets for 2020 and 2050 set out in Energy and Environment documents published by the European Commission, as well as, with the EU Directive 2009/31/EC and the GHG gases legal management.The relation of fossil fuel usage and Public Health is well demonstrated and described in detail under the wide concept of Medical Geology (see a synthesis in “Medical Geology” edited by O. Selinus et al., Elsevier, 2005), clearly justifying interdisciplinarity among the Energy, Environment and Basic Health Sciences. Additionally, we should refer that the interdisciplinary program herewith proposed is implicitly recommended in the document entitled “Plano Nacional de Acção Ambiental e Saúde 2008-2013 (PNAAS)” and in the “Environment and Health in Portugal” published by the European Environment Agency, and the “Plano Nacional de Saúde 2012-2016, Eixo 3.4”.2. Activities of the Research groups3ERLa) Thematic Domain in Fossil EnergyFor the 2015-2020 period, we will focus on the area of Geologic sequestration of CO2 including Reservoir modelling. The projects to be developed, are focused on: i)AQUIFERS –Potential use of Saline Aquifers for Geological Storage of CO2 in Portugal; ii)EOGR - Fluid Circulation and Storage in Conventional Reservoirs: Application to CO2 Geological Sequestration and Hydrocarbons Enhanced Production; iii)FRACTURING - 3D Coal Fracturing/“Cleat system”; iv)INQUIRY - Public perception/acceptance with regard to CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage)Technologies.b) Thematic Domain 2EPHThe 2EPH, in line with the EC and national policy for Environment and Health will focus on the following strategic specific fields of R&D: i)Modelling of Human exposure to pollutants; ii)Indoor and outdoor air quality - relationship between different microenvironments; iii)Atmosphere-ocean interaction - impact of pollutants at coastal ecosystems; iv)Impact of climate change, including estimation of ghg; v)Atmospheric impact of biomass burning.Also, in line with the ec and national policy for water resources management, the 2EPH thematic domain will focus on: (i)water resources management, including watershed modelling, water quality and sediment transport; (ii)limnology and ecological status of freshwater ecosystems; (iii)processes for pollution control.CEBIMEDThe CEBIMED Research Group is branched in three thematic domains (Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics; Toxicology and Pharmacology; and Chemistry and Pharmacy).The Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics Group is actively engaged in research in microbial pathogenesis, cell and molecular immunology, molecular genetics, cancer cell biology and molecular virology. This will allow both basic and applied research in Infection, Immunity and Genetics, both in relation to Environmental changes or stimuli, or in fundamental Health sciences. Also resistance to antibacterial, antiviral or antifungal agents and its relation to their environmental and food availability will be studied. Also Biomaterial behaviour relative to bacteria, and epidemiology of infection and chronic diseases will also be major topics.The Toxicology and Pharmacology Group will study molecular, cellular and organ systems pharmacology and chemicals toxicology. The research will focus on both pharmacology and toxicology aspects of drugs either of therapeutical or environmental origin.The Chemistry and Pharmacy group research group is focused into Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery, and the environmental effects of new therapeutical regimens. Research will focus on the discovery of novel anticancer agents, anti-infection drugs, molecular neurosciences, and natural products and phytomedicines. The group provides integrated drug discovery services from hit compounds to candidate drugs.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,UID/Multi/04546/2013,,,,,,,,Fundação Ensino e Cultura Fernando Pessoa,Fundação Ensino e Cultura Fernando Pessoa,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15470333,,

However, the development of ultra deepwater field posed many challenges, in particular, on the selection of the riser concept. Long suspended length of riser will significantly increase the vessel payload. High external hydrostatic pressure on the riser will increase the probability of collapse failure. Large dynamic motions of the vessel and large vessel offset yields potential buckling issues at the touch-down-point (TDP). In addition, potential fatigue problems due to vessel motions and soil-riser interactions also present at TDP area. Large current speed in deepwater field might also lead to vortex induced vibration (VIV) which eventually will contribute to significant fatigue damage for particular riser sections. By looking into these challenges, it is very important to select the most appropriate riser concept for the ultra deepwater field.Catenary Offset Buoyant Riser Assembly (COBRA) as newly developed hybrid riser concept offers a solution to overcome the challenges in ultra deepwater field. In general, COBRA consists of a catenary riser section with a long-slender sub-surface buoyancy module on top which is tethered down to sea bed via two mooring lines. The catenary section from top of the sub-surface buoy is connected to the floater by a flexible jumper. This flexible jumper can effectively absorb the floater motions, which give significant improvements for both strength and fatigue performance on the overall system. As a hybrid riser concept, this concept offers cost effective solution by avoiding all the expensive bottom assemblies that normally needed for a hybrid riser concept.This paper focuses on COBRA riser concept specifically for Santos Basin Central Cluster region at 2200 m water depth. It is observed that there is common sudden change phenomenon on the current direction in Santos Basin area. The effect of bidirectional current is analyzed, and the comparison with unidirectional current is discussed thoroughly. The analyses are focused on the global strength design performance under extreme environmental load and global fatigue design performance of the riser due to wave induced and VIV induced.The results clearly indicate that COBRA riser concept has a robust design and it is feasible for 2200 m water depth, in particular for Santos Basin Cluster Region area. It is also shows that COBRA riser has sufficient strength performance even for extreme bidirectional current.",,,,,"32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 09-14, 2013JUN 09-14, 2013","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Nantes, FRANCENantes, FRANCE",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,978-0-7918-5537-9,,,,,,,,,"Subsea 7, Stavanger, NorwayPetrobras SA, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Subsea 7,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000360515200030,,

In order to obtain a sufficient stable W/O emulsion for the field trial, bunker fuel oil (IFO380) and various concentrations of an emulsifier (Paramula (R)) were also added to the residues of oil topped on large scale and investigated through interfacial tension, contact angle, droplet adhesion and dip and withdraw tests. The investigations revealed that the addition of an emulsifier lowered the interfacial tension of oil residues, which consequently reduced the adherence properties of the oil and emulsions to the surface of the skimmer material.

This paper studied the biomass difference, the spatiotemporal dynamics and vertical distribution of soil carbon storage in three dominant saltmarsh plant communities, i. e., Phragmites australis, Spartina alterniflora and Scirpus mariqueter in the Chongming Dongtan wetland, in the Yangtze Estuary. The results indicated that the gross biomass in the three saltmarsh plant communities was in the order of S. alterniflora (5750.7 g . m(-2)) > P. australis (4655.1 g . m(-2)) > S. mariqueter (812.7 g . m(-2)). The aboveground biomass was the highest in summer, and autumn, and the underground biomass was the highest in winter. The soil carbon storage (0-50 cm) was the lowest in spring, gradually increased, and was the highest in winter. The annual increment of soil carbon storage decreased from the high tidal zone to the low tidal zone, and was in the order of P. australis community (711.8 g . m(-2)) > S. alterniflora community (646.2 g . m(-2)) > S. mariqueter community (185.3 g . m(-2)) > bare mudflat (65.6 g . m(-2)).

Water column integrated biomass shows different spatial and seasonal patterns than the surface POC concentrations, and is increasing in many ocean regions. Globally averaged POC biomass is also increasing. At the same time ocean colour data indicate a decrease in the global oceanic productivity (PP).

Bridges deliver such a fundamental service to society that they are often taken for granted. Typically, bridges only stir the public's interest when they must unexpectedly be replaced at great cost, or, worse, fail. The Living Bridge project will create a self-diagnosing, self-reporting smart bridge powered by a local renewable energy source, tidal energy, by transforming the landmark Memorial Bridge--a vertical lift bridge over the tidal Piscataqua River, with pedestrian access connecting Portsmouth, New Hampshire to Kittery, Maine--into a living laboratory for researchers, engineers, scientists, and the community at large. The Living Bridge will engage innovators in sensor and renewable energy technology by creating an incubator platform on a working bridge, from which researchers can field test and evaluate the impact and effectiveness of emerging technologies. The Living Bridge will also serve as a community platform to educate citizens about innovations occurring at the site and in the region, and about how incorporating renewable energy into bridge design can lead to a sustainable transportation infrastructure with impact far beyond the region. Sustainable, smart bridges are key elements in developing a successful infrastructure system. To advance the state of smart service systems and clean energy conversion, this project team will design and deploy a structural and environmental monitoring system that provides information for bridge condition assessment, traffic management, and environmental stewardship; advances renewable energy technology application; and excites the general public about bridge innovations. This PFI:BIC project is enabled through partnerships between academic researchers with expertise in structural, mechanical and ocean engineering, sensing technology and social science; small businesses with expertise in instrumentation, data acquisition, tidal energy conversion; and state agencies with bridge design expertise. The Living Bridge technical areas are structural health monitoring, tidal energy conversion with fluid-structure interaction measurements, estuarine environmental monitoring, and outreach communication. Sensors will be used to calibrate a three-dimensional analytical structural finite element model of the bridge. The predicted structural response from this model will assess the measured structural response of the bridge as acceptable or not. Instruments installed on the turbine deployment platform will measure the spatio-temporal structure of the turbulent inflow and modified wake flow downstream of the turbine. Resulting data will include turbine performance and loads for use in fluid-structure interaction models. Deployed environmental sensors will measure estuarine water quality; wildlife deterrent sensors will deter fish from the turbine. Hydrophones and video cameras will be used before and during turbine deployment to monitor environmental changes due to turbine presence. Outreach efforts will make bridge data, history, and information about new systems accessible and understandable to the public and K-12 educators, facilitated by an information kiosk installed at the bridge. Public awareness will be assessed with survey methods used in the N.H. Granite State Poll.

If stored below the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ), unwanted vertical migration of CO2 can be effectively inhibited by the formation of solid hydrate layers. Lowering the risks of CO2 leakage to the atmosphere is instrumental to accelerate the implementation of full-scale carbon sequestration in the North Sea and elsewhere. In the laboratory, we have successfully visualized CO2 trapping phenomena, measured CO2 leakage rates, and demonstrated that the integrity of the hydrate seal strongly depends on fluid-rock interactions and initial water distribution. CO2 propagation in water-filled core samples has been monitored over a total of 140 days inside the GHSZ. Solid CO2 hydrate formed and sealed the pore space in both homogeneous sandstone and heterogeneous limestone cores. However, the physical flow barrier developed considerably faster in sandstone (after 1.8 pore volumes - PV) compared to limestone (after 7.4 PV), with a factor ten reduced CO2 leakage rate through the seal in favor of sandstone. Furthermore, pore-scale images of upward CO2 migration verified trapping of CO2 both as solid hydrate precipitation and as liquid CO2 clusters made discontinuous and stabilized by capillary forces. Small-scale hydrate rearrangement followed initial formation, and caused temporarily dissociation of local hydrate structures without affecting the overall integrity of the seal. Our study suggests that a homogeneous, water-filled GHSZ directly above a CO2 storage site can provide a secondary safety mechanism and significantly reduce the risk of CO2 leakage.",,,,,,,,,34,2,0,0,6,0,37,,,1385-8947,1873-3212,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bergen, Dept Chem, Bergen, NorwayUniv Bergen, Dept Phys & Technol, Bergen, NorwayHeriot Watt Univ, Inst Petr Engn, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2019-12-10,WOS:000499066900052,,

The recreational fishery for gray snapper has developed rapidly in south Louisiana with the advent of harvest and seasonal restrictions on the established red snapper (L. campechanus) fishery. We examined the age and growth of gray snapper in Louisiana with the use of cross-sectioned sagittae. A total of 833 specimens, (441 males, 387 females, and 5 of unknown sex) were opportunistically sampled from the recreational fishery from August 1998 to August 2002. Males ranged in size from 222 to 732 mm total length (TL) and from 280 g to 5700 g total weight (TW) and females ranged from 254 to 756 mm TL and from 340 g to 5800 g TW. Both edge analysis and bomb radiocarbon analyses were used to validate otolith-based age estimates. Ages were estimated for 718 individuals; both males and females ranged from 1 to 28 years. The von Bertalanffy growth models derived from TL at age were L-t = 655.4{1-e([-0.23(t)])} for males, L-t = 657.3{1-e([-0.21(t)])} for females, and L-t = 656.4{[1-e([A.22(t)])} for all specimens of known sex. Catch curves were used to produce a total mortality (Z) estimate of 0.17. Estimates of M calculated with various methods ranged from 0.15 to 0.50; however we felt that M = 0.15 was the most appropriate estimate based on our estimate of Z.

Given the location of the oil spill affecting communities that had been devastated by Hurricane Katrina, results also revealed that losses from Hurricane Katrina were highly associated with negative mental health outcomes. Conversely, the ability to rebound after adversity and place satisfaction were highly associated with better mental health outcomes.Conclusions: Enhanced understanding of mental health effects after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill will help in determining directions for much-needed mental health services after the disaster and in contributing to the knowledge of complex traumatization and the ability to rebound after adversity.

Using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), it was determined that sediments from four locations contained type I gas hydrate, which encage mostly methane (96-98%) and a small amount of carbon dioxide. For all hydrates, the lattice constant was estimated to be 11.85 angstrom at 113 K, which approximately equals that of pure methane hydrate. The result is in good agreement with the structure of artificially synthesized methane + carbon dioxide mixed-gas hydrates. These results suggest that the lattice constant of the natural gas hydrate does not change due to a change of CO2 gas content. In addition, the thermal expansion of the sampled hydrate was measured for the temperature range of 83-173 K, and the resulting density of the hydrate crystal at 273 K was estimated to be 0.92 g/cm(3).

Over 75% of the United States population of yellow-billed loons nests in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPRA), where impending oil and gas development will intersect their breeding range. We investigated the relationship of recent oilfield development to occupancy of yellow-billed loon territories by breeding pairs (indicated by active nests) and broods using 14 years of aerial surveys on the Colville River delta. We also evaluated the survey requirements prescribed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for NPRA. We began aerial surveys for yellow-billed loons in 1993, prior to construction of the Alpine oilfield in 1998, and followed territories through 2008, after construction of 2 additional satellite drill sites. We used records from 37 breeding territories on 36 lakes in model selection analyses to examine how habitat and disturbance factors (proximity to facilities and construction time period) influenced occupancy by breeding pairs and broods. Annually, 13 +/- 2.5 (SE)% (n = 14 yr) of broods (n = 19) moved from nesting lakes to adjacent brood-rearing lakes, and the remainder stayed in nesting lakes (n = 128). Lakes used for nesting and brood-rearing were almost 25 times larger (x over bar = 95.9 +/- 25 ha, n = 23 lakes) than nesting lakes from which broods left (x over bar = 4.0 +/- 1.1 ha, n = 7 lakes, P < 0.001). Thirty-eight percent of territories (n = 14 territories) were on lakes shared by >1 breeding pair. Lake type (deep open lakes with islands or polygonized margins, deep open lakes without islands or polygonized margins, and tapped lakes with high-water connections) was the most influential covariate on occupancy by breeding pairs, and lake area was most influential on occupancy by broods. Time period and distance to facilities (as discrete zones at 1.6 km and 3.2 km and as linear distance) were factors in the highest-ranked models for 5 of the 6 model sets that included disturbance parameters. Interaction terms for time period and distance to oilfield facilities were factors in 3 of 6 model sets. The pattern of occupancy of breeding territories, however, was not consistent with disturbance-related effects. Occupancy of territories by breeding pairs was lower in the pre-development period (lowest human activity) than in the latest development period (highest human activity) and higher in the zones near oilfield facilities than far from facilities. Occupancy of territories by broods was highest in the latest development period and similarly high in zones near and far from facilities. Application of BLM minimum survey requirements (3 yr with 2 surveys/yr) to the initial 3 years of surveys in this study resulted in detecting 81% of the known territories on the Colville River delta. The BLM restrictions on development were judged conservative in maintaining breeding territories around oilfield developments. Our results did not demonstrate displacement of nests or broods from long-standing territories by oil development. Our findings suggest that territory occupancy by breeding pairs and broods of yellow-billed loons on the Colville River delta was resilient to levels of human activity at recently constructed oilfield facilities.

The main tidal components in this area are irregular diurnal tidal currents, and their ellipses are spiraling with depth. The power spectrum indicates that the tidal energy reaches the maximum near the thermocline and then decreases with depth. The analysis of the current frequency also shows that the currents have significant near-inertial oscillations.

This paper begins to address the microbial composition and aqueous chemistry and the potential for intrinsic and enhanced bioremediation of these waters. The waters from a gas and oil shale in the Marcellus and Bakken regions, respectively, were analyzed for inorganic elements, organic chemicals, microbial taxonomic composition, and biodegradative capabilities. The waters were highly saline, reaching NaCl concentrations up to 3.5 N, but no significant levels of radioactive elements were detected. More than 1,000 organic compounds were separated and identified by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The major classes of organic compounds, in order of decreasing abundance, were aliphatics, cycloaliphatics, single-ring aromatics, and polycyclic aromatic compounds. The bacterial genera found natively in the waters were identified by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes within the extracted DNA. The major genera identified included strains known to thrive under saline conditions (Halanaerobium, Marinobacter, Oceanimonas, Streptohalobacillus) and degrade petroleum hydrocarbons (Thauera, Pseudomonas, Marinobacterium, Williamsia, Colwellia). Microbial populations were extracted from the Bakken shale waters, encapsulated within silica gels, and then reintroduced into their waters of origin. Both intrinsic biodegradation from the free native microorganisms and enhanced biodegradation with the addition of encapsulated bacteria were observed. In total, this paper begins to better define the properties of waters derived from hydraulic fracturing and suggests a potential for the application of bioremediation to remove organic contaminants.

In this paper, the alternative transportation options for CO2 from a Finnish capture plant case are assessed. The assessment includes selection of the most favourable storage areas, route planning for both ship and pipeline transportation, and cost estimates for both alternatives. An actual CCS demonstration is planned by the proprietor power companies of the chosen case plant, a coal condensing power plant on the coast of Western Finland, giving an interesting opportunity to discuss the results in the light of the current development of the demonstration plant.Transportation costs are presented for a ship transportation chain from the case plant to the North Sea and for a pipeline running towards the coast of the Barents Sea. The storage areas were chosen because of the potential storage capacity and currently operational injection activities in both regions.Pipeline transportation is found considerably more expensive than ship transportation as an option for CO2 transportation from the case demonstration plant to the different storage sites. The levelized costs of shipping the captured CO2 to the geological formations under the North Sea are estimated to amount to 11,8 (sic)/tCO(2), excluding the costs for liquefaction.Matching a CO2 source within EU to a sink outside EU depends on a consistent regulatory framework. In addition to accountability of emissions allowances within the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), the issues include liabilities of CO2 handling and storage, other legislation both on national and on Community level as well as international maritime conventions.

Carbon sequestration, which includes capture and storage of inorganic carbon, is one potential component of a carbon management plan. In particular, utilization of atmospheric CO2 by algae has been proposed for carbon capture, particularly at high pH since CO2 absorption rates increase with increasing pH. The goal of this study was to quantify the growth and inorganic carbon utilization of a mixed freshwater green algal culture at high pH. Algal cultures were supplied with different initial media inorganic carbon concentrations (11 to 32 mg C L-1 as Na2CO3), maintained in a controlled environment, and adjusted to an initial pH of 10.3. Samples were taken daily to measure pH, alkalinity, inorganic carbon, and total suspended solids. Results indicated that the culture was dominated by Scenedesmus at all inorganic carbon concentrations. Peak biomass, specific growth rate, and biomass carbon content generally increased with increasing initial inorganic carbon concentration. Nonlinear regression was used to estimate a maximum specific growth rate of 0.0727 h(-1) and half-saturation constants of 5.36 x 10(-4), 6.84, 10.4, and 17.5 mg C L-1 for CO2, HCO3-, CO32, and total inorganic carbon, respectively. Comparison of changes in the concentrations of inorganic carbon species due to pH increase and utilization by algae suggest that CO2, HCO3-, and CO32- (i.e., total inorganic carbon) contributed to biomass production. Overall, the determined stoichiometric and kinetic parameters can be used to facilitate modeling and optimization of algal-based carbon capture strategies.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,5,,,2151-0032,2151-0040,,,,,,,,,,"The Citadel, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Charleston, SC USAClemson Univ, Biosyst Engn Program, Clemson, SC USA",The Citadel,,,2017-02-22,WOS:000392932500015,,

In this paper, an optimized friction stir process of 2507 SDSS is carried out to refine the microstructure of the material in order to improve its mechanical properties. Microstructure analysis revealed that grains were refined from a size of around 160 mu m in the base material to 2-30 mu m in the processed zone.

Final report.",,,,,,,,OCS Study Report MMS,,,,2009-038,,,,i,"xiv, 1-93",,,,,,,,,,,Article,July 2009,2009,"This Task Order, funded by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) describes subsistence whaling as currently conducted near Cross Island by residents of Nuiqsut. While traditional subsistence whaling has been well documented in a number of locations, contemporary subsistence whaling is not as well documented, especially in terms of change over time. This effort is designed to measure basic parameters of Cross Island whaling so that observed changes (if any) can in the future be analyzed in relation to such factors as oil and gas activities, weather and ice conditions, or other variables. Observations, and the narrative annual report summarizing them, focus on descriptive measures of activities associated with whaling. Special attention is devoted to geospatial information through the sharing of GIS information by participating whaling crews. While this information can be analyzed as a self-contained database, it can also be examined in conjunction with the many pertinent external databases (for example, weather records, sea ice condition remote sensing photographs, AEWC historical bowhead whale harvest records). This report focuses on the former, with the addition of weather information from the Deadhorse weather station, historical (pre-2001) whale landings for Nuiqsut whalers, and whaler accounts of past whaling seasons and interactions with industrial and commercial activities in the central Beaufort Sea area. Comprehensive information on oil and gas activities in this area is limited, mostly of a confidential nature, and documents only the time period prior to that documented in this report . The project is also designed as a collaborative effort of MMS and its contractor, Applied Sociocultural Research (ASR), the subsistence whalers from Nuiqsut, and the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission (AEWC). Beyond the goal of the seven years of descriptive information on Cross Island subsistence whaling activities (documented in this report (and four additional field seasons funded for 2008-2011), the project will develop a system for collecting such information that local whalers themselves can adopt, adapt, and maintain. Three primary methods of information collection were employed [long dash] systematic observations, collection of daily vessel locational information from handheld GPS units, and whalers' self- reports and perceptions. Emphasis has been placed on such measures as: Number of whaling crews actively whaling and number of boats used (observation) Size and composition of whaling and boat crews, and fluctuation over the whaling season (observation) Number of whales harvested (observation, self-report) Days spent whaling, and days prevented from whaling (observation, self-report) Days suitable for whaling when whaling did not occur (observation, self-report) Subsistence activities occurring other than whaling (self-report, observation) Location of whale searching, whale sightings, and whale harvest (GPS, self-report) Local weather and ice conditions (observation, self-report) Bowhead whale behavior in the Cross Island area, and differences from past experience (self- report) Changes in access or other issues related to the whale hunt, such as increased effort for the same (or reduced) harvest, increased risk, increased cost (self-report) For the seven seasons documented in this report, the time at least one whaling crew was at Cross Island ranged from 13 to 30 days, and the number of whaling crews active in any one season ranged from 3 to 5. The number of boats taken to Cross Island and potentially available to whale ranged from 7 to 10, and the seasonal maximum number of people actually physically present on Cross Island ranged from 33 to 43. Days when weather prevented the whalers from scouting for whales ranged from 3 to 15, and days when whalers went out scouting for whales ranged from 5 to 15. Whales were seen on most days when whalers went out scouting, but the percentage varied seasonally from 50 to 100 percent. The seasonal average for scouting trips ranged from 30.1 to 84.0 miles (roundtrip) and from 4 hours 31 minutes to nine hours 43 minutes. The average seasonal strike distance from Cross Island ranged from 9.3 miles to 25.9 miles. The shortest season documented (2007) had the minimal values for all these variables except average temporal duration of trip and average strike distance from Cross Island. he annual quota for the Nuiqsut whalers was four strikes, or a potential for 28 whales landed. They landed a total of 22 whales and also had 2 struck-and-lost whales, using 86 percent of their allocated strikes and landing 92 percent of the whales they struck. Only in 2005 did they land less than 3 whales, when adverse ice conditions, poor weather conditions, and possible interference from a commercial barge limited their opportunities to physically find and approach whales. In 2005 the whalers could reach the open water where whales were swimming on only two days, and large swells made it dangerous for them to leave the protection of the floating ice to boat into the open water to find and approach whales on one of those days. On the day they could boat into the open water they landed one whale, but also encountered a commercial barge. The whalers experienced adverse conditions of one sort of another in all other seasons (whales somewhat distant from Cross Island and ?skittish? in 2001 and 2002, poor weather in 2003-2007, restrictive ice conditions in 2006) but were still able to use the limited windows of suitable whaling conditions to land whales. Whales were generally closer to Cross Island (8 to 15 miles) in the seasons with poor weather and no or little ice. For the seasons when whales were more distant from Cross Island and there was some limited amount of floating ice, the weather and overall whaling conditions were somewhat more benign than in other seasons. The relationship between the location of the whale migration in relation to Cross Island and the seasonal environmental conditions is not clear. More detailed descriptions of each season is included in this report and the Annual Reports cited in the References Cited section. The report also contains a comparative discussion of the 2001-2007 Cross Island whaling seasons, and some information from earlier seasons as well.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Applied Sociocultural Research, 519 West Eighth Avenue, Suite 204, Post Office Box 99510, Anchorage, AK 99510-1352, USA",,,,2009-07-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14602010632,,

Previous workers inferred that large cavities are paleocaves (paleokarst) formed near the surface and subsequently buried. Alternately, caves may have formed by dissolution at depth along faults. Using 227 samples from 16 cores, we document textures and cement compositions bearing on cavity histories with petrographic, high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM), isotopic, and fluid inclusion microthermometric observations. Results show that dissolution occurred at depth and was caused by (1) acidic fluids derived from Middle-Late Silurian and/or Devonian-Permian hydrocarbon generation and maturation, (2) high-temperature fluids, of which some were associated with Late Permian igneous activity, and (3) Mg-rich fluids that accompanied Jurassic-Cretaceous deformation and the formation of partially open fractures and stylobreccias (fault breccias). The relative paragenetic sequence of the structure-related diagenesis suggests seven stages of fracturing, dissolution, and cementation. Mottle fabrics in the Yijianfang Formation contain argillaceous carbonate-rich silt and are bioturbation features formed within the marine environment. Those mottled fabrics differ from clearly karstic features in the overlying Lianglitage Formation, which formed by near-surface dissolution and subsequent infilling of cavities by allochthonous sediment. Mottle fabrics are crosscut by compacted fractures filled with phreatic-vadose marine cements and followed by subsequent generations of cement-filled fractures and vugs indicating that some fractures and vugs became cement filled prior to later dissolution events. Calcite cements in fractures and vugs show progressively depleted values of delta O-18 documenting cement precipitation within the shallow (220 m), intermediate (625 m), and deep (2000 m) diagenetic environments. Deep (mesogenetic) dissolution associated with fractures is therefore the principal source of the high porosity-permeability in the reservoir, consistent with other pieces of evidence for cavities localized near faults.",,,,,,,,,29,1,0,0,2,0,30,,,1468-8115,1468-8123,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Bur Econ Geol, Univ Stn Box 10, Austin, TX 78713 USA",,,,2020-05-15,WOS:000530339300002,,

Researchers from the Austrian National Institute of Polar Research (Austria, and Lund University (Sweden) will join the programme at a later stage. Such an approach will help achieve the synergy of the European and Russian approaches to environmental education. The Russian-Norwegian master programme Geoecological monitoring and rational use of natural resources in the Northern oil and gas production regions is a good example of the third form of international environmental education. The programme similar to POMOR and CORELIS. However, it has one distinctive feature - Russian and foreign students study together from the second term only.

The predicted locations of the plugs are often farther upstream than observed in the field trials. This is mainly because of the assumption of a hydrate/oil slip factor of zero, which forces the hydrate to accumulate where it initially formed. In reality, hydrate agglomerates would be carried further downstream before eventually jamming in dips.Predicting where and when hydrate plugs will form in subsea tiebacks is of increasing importance as the industry strives to manage the risk of plugging in oil and gas flowlines while minimizing the use of costly and environmentally harmful chemicals for hydrate inhibition.

To assess these impacts, archival underwater acoustic recorders are typically deployed before the activity of interest, then retrieved and their data analyzed afterwards. The significant drawback to this approach is that impacts can only be assessed well after the activity in question, making mitigation of that particular activity impossible. A more recent technology developed to reduce the probability of whale-ship collisions, the Auto-Buoy system [1], reduces the time between activity and mitigation with a delay of 20-30 minutes, but does not address noise impacts. Recent interest in using the Wave Glider (R) (Liquid Robotics, Sunnyvale, CA) for environmental monitoring related to the oil and gas industry [2], and using it to acquire acoustic data [3-5], suggests the potential for using this autonomous vehicle as a real-time monitoring and mitigation tool. The current work involves developing an acoustic data acquisition and transmission system for use with a Wave Glider, to provide real-time data for marine mammal monitoring and mitigation [6].

The long-term distributions of PM2.5 showed the annual average PM2.5 concentrations constantly exceeded the EPA and WHO guidelines. They varied from 77 to 49g/m(3) with an overall average of 61.25g/m(3). While the inter-annual variability in PM2.5 concentrations showed relatively a cyclic pattern, with successive ups and downs, it broadly exhibited an increasing trend, particularly, over the last 14years. PM2.5 concentrations displayed a strong seasonal pattern, with greatest values observed during warm summer season, a period of high demand of electricity and dust events. The lowest values found in autumn are attributable to reduced demand of energy. Decreased atmospheric temperatures and high relative humidity coinciding with this period are likely to reduce the secondary formation of PM2.5. The spatial changes in PM2.5 concentrations exhibited gradual downward trends to the north and northeast directions. Airborne PM2.5 is prevalent in the southern and western regions, where the majority of oil and gas fields are located. PM2.5/PM10 ratio indicated that ambient aerosols are principally associated with anthropogenic sources. Peaks in PM2.5/CO ratio were frequently observed during June, July, and August, although few were concurrent with March. This indicates that secondary formation plays an important role in PM2.5 levels measured in these months, especially as the photochemical activities become relatively strong in these periods. The lowest PM2.5/CO ratios were found during September, October, and November (autumn) suggesting a considerable contribution of primary combustion emissions, especially vehicular emissions, to PM2.5 concentration. PM2.5 concentrations are positively correlated with sulfate levels. In addition to sea and dust aerosols, sulfate concentration in the coastal region is also related to fossil fuel burning from power plants, oil and gas fields, and oil industries. The population-weighted average of PM2.5 in UAE was 63.9g/m(3), which is more than three times greater than the global population-weighted mean of 20g/m(3).",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,8,0,12,,,0167-6369,1573-2959,,,,,,,,,,"Yarmouk Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Fac Sci, Irbid 21163, JordanYarmouk Univ, Deanship Sci Res & Grad Studies, Irbid 21163, JordanZayed Univ, Coll Nat & Hlth Sci, POB 144534, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",,,,2019-03-01,WOS:000458176700006,30734105,

The research involved acute (24- and 48-h) freshwater and marine toxicity tests on whole PW and PW fractions generated by standard U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and PW-specific fractionation schemes. Factors influencing PW TIEs were investigated, such as the effect of salinity in selecting fractionation manipulations, the effect of toxicity test replication (i.e., reproducibility) in distinguishing changes in toxicities between whole PW and its fractions, and the suitability of different test species in PW TIEs. The results obtained and lessons learned from conducting these PW TIEs are presented in this article. Components, or fractions, contributing to toxicity differed for each PW with no specific fraction being consistently toxic. For most PW samples, toxicity attributed to any one fraction represented only part of the toxicity of the whole sample.

It is shown that the cuttings can be remediated to below the offshore discharge threshold of 1% oil on cuttings, and that clean-up can occur to below 0.1% oil, which is the classification for non-hazardous waste. The trade-off between applied power, throughput and residual oil content is shown for tests carried out continuously over several hours.

The Smart-Spider, which is real-time controlled by its own on-board MCU core and power supplied by a hugged-up battery, is expected to execute pipeline inspection in an autonomous manner. A flexible mechanism structure is applied to realize the spider's flexibility to adapt to different diameters of pipelines as well as to handle some irregular situations, such as to pass through an obstacled areas or to maneuver at a corner or junction. This adaption is automatically controlled by the MCU controller based on pressure sensors' feedback. The equipped devices, such as the selected motors and battery package, as well as the human-and-machine interface are also discussed in detail.

One of the key issues within the framework of the State Program on Socio-Economic Development of the Regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2014-2018 is to achieve ecological and economic balance. For this purpose, the important part of the Republic's environmental policy is to protect the existing ecosystems to meet the needs of present and future generations. One of the key factors for sustainable development is the protection of the environment and the solution of environmental problems. Thus, some of the provisions proposed in the 21st century are related to the protection of the environment and the rational use of natural resources. In order to ensure sustainable development in our country, it is important to utilize complex minerals and primary raw materials. Continuous increase in the number of population, rapid development of science and technology also increases demand for raw materials and products. The complex utilization of natural resources has already been formed in relation to oil and gas. Its economic assessment and stimulation are fully implemented. Certain institutional measures have been taken to ensure the systematic management of the environment and natural resources in accordance with the principles of transition to sustainable development. The most obvious example of this is the creation of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources in Azerbaijan. The article considers the mineral resources resources, the ecological and economic aspects of their use, and the environmental impact dimensions. Sustainable development has been highlighted in the future use of fuels and ore sources. It was noted that limited land, water and forest resources of our republic should be utilized and recultivation and reclamation measures should be taken to eliminate environmental damage. Measures are taken to ensure environmental sustainability in accordance with the main objectives of the Azerbaijan-2020: A Look Into Future development concept. Sustainable development is a development that ensures the needs of the present day without endangering the possibilities of future generations. The ecological and economic aspects of this development include the oceans and seas, climate change, environment, waste management, ecosystems and biodiversity. Effective and comprehensive use of our country's natural resource potential, including biodiversity conservation, neutralization of the negative impact of the fuel and energy complex on the environment, restoration of useless areas and the effective protection of existing resources, will continue in the coming years as well.

Following a second larger oil spill during the salvage works of the Tricolor a few weeks later, in total 9,1-7 birds stranded at the Belgian coast during the period 23 January to 15 February. This time, virtually all birds were heavily oiled and more than half of the birds were still alive on arrival in Ostend.

A first peak in numbers (> 1,000 victims per day) occurred al 26 January and consisted of high proportions of Guillemots that managed to reach the coast alive despite unfavourable wind conditions. In the following weeks, the daily numbers of stranded birds were closely related to the prevailing wind conditions. The second and third peak in the number of strandings coincided with two periods of strong onshore winds. changes in the species composition and the location where the birds were found are thought to reflect the movements of the oil slick perpendicular and parallel to the coastline, respectively. The proportion of Razorbills among the auks found during the incident greatly differed from that at sea and the proportion of dead birds was much higher among Razorbills than Guillemots. These differences can not be explained from differences in wintering areas.

Counted totals of Common Scoter were markedly higher than in 2001/02, exceeding 12,000 birds in Liverpool Bay in three of the four winter months, and exceeding 24,000 in February 2003; numbers over Shell Flat alone were 14,000 in the same month, the highest recorded aerial survey total of Common Scoter at a single UK site to date. Counted numbers in Cardigan Bay varied between 2000 and 4000. Estimates of the true number present (calculated using 'distance analysis' as part of a separate exercise) suggest that at least 25,000 birds were present in Liverpool Bay during winter months in 2002/03, and over 79,000 in February 2003. Numbers in Liverpool Bay as a whole, and perhaps within some of its constituent sites, therefore exceeded the 1% international threshold (16,000) and, following similar numbers in the previous two winters, the site qualifies for designation as a marine Special Protection Area (SPA). No estimates were made of true numbers in Cardigan Bay. Sites favoured by Common Scoter in Liverpool and Cardigan Bays closely matched those identified in 2001/02. There was an apparent shift of birds to deeper waters as winter progressed, presumed to be in response to food depletion. A survey in August 2002 recorded over 6000 birds, a time of year when wildfowl moult their wing feathers and are flightless for a period of 4-6 weeks; circumstantial evidence supports the suggestion that a proportion was likely to have been flightless. Very few birds remained by mid May, suggesting (based on observations in spring 2002) that the main departure from Liverpool Bay occurs in late April or early May. Numbers of divers - which were not all identified to species, but most of which are likely to have been Redthroated Divers - were widely distributed throughout Liverpool and Cardigan Bays. Birds were present between November and February, and their distribution extended further offshore than scoters. Counted numbers were relatively small, but exceeded the 1% national threshold in Liverpool Bay in three months. Estimates using 'distance analysis' suggest that between 250 and 1200 birds were present during winter months in 2002/03. Similar numbers were recorded in 2001/02 and, following UK Government guidelines that sites supporting this number of species listed on Annex 1 of the EC Birds Directive qualify as an SPA, Liverpool Bay also qualifies for designation as a marine SPA based on numbers of divers. Large numbers of gulls and auks were recorded in many months during survey in 2002/03: gulls were thinly but widely distributed throughout the survey area, while the distribution of auks varied between months, presumed to be in response to changes in the distribution of their prey. Further aerial survey is recommended using the same technique to improve understanding of changes in numbers and distribution during the winter, late summer and spring periods, and to assess variation between years. Surveys should be undertaken of the whole of Liverpool bay - from Anglesey to Morecambe Bay - to cover all areas important for the key species as synchronously as possible. Consideration should be given to extending the survey area west along the north coast of Anglesey and to more regular coverage in northern parts of the survey area to assist with SPA boundary placement. Exploratory surveys early and late in the day should be conducted at the key concentrations to assess whether differences in distribution exist at those times.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2004-05-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14205029888,,

They are treated as the lifeline of the subsea production system for offshore oil and gas exploitation. During operation, umbilical needs to undertake self-weight and periodical load due to the ocean environment. Meanwhile, the heat during power transmission in electric cable is released to the umbilical body, which influences the mechanical properties and optical transmission in the cable. However, there are a number of components and many kinds of sectional arrangement for the umbilical. So the sectional design with multiple components needs to be solved as a multidisciplinary optimization problem. From the mechanical point of view, the umbilical structure should be designed with more compacted and symmetric layout to obtain even probability of resistance to loads and reduce structural stress to improve its fatigue performance. Concerning thermal effect, these units should be arranged to dissipate the heat easily to avoid the influence on the functional and structural components. In this paper, compactedness, symmetry and temperature distribution are quantified through introducing corresponding indices. Then multidisciplinary optimization framework is established. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) intelligent algorithm is adopted to carry out the optimization to obtain the optimal solution, which is far superior to the initial design. The optimization design strategy is proved to be effective and efficient by some numerical examples, which provides reference for design of umbilical cables.",,,,,"34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015","Amer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivAmer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","St John's, CANADASt John's, CANADA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5651-2,,,,,,,,,"Dalian Univ Tech, Dalian, Liaoning, Peoples R China",,,,2016-06-15,WOS:000375807600013,,

These studies have been used to refine monitoring methods, and to develop and validate a dispersion and impact assessment model. This paper summarizes monitoring data from surveys conducted in two major oil and gas production areas, and compares the results to concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in surface waters predicted by the dose-related risk and effect assessment model (DREAM). Blue mussels and semi-permeable membrane devices (SPMDs) were deployed in the Ekofisk and Tampen Regions and analyzed for more than 50 PAH. PAH concentrations in ambient seawater were estimated based on the mussels and SPMD concentrations, and compared to model predictions. Surface water total PAH concentrations ranged from 25 to 350 ng/L within I km of the platform discharges and reached background levels of 4-8 ng/L within 5-10 km of the discharge; a 100,000-fold dilution of the PAH in the discharge water. The PAH concentrations in surface water, predicted by three methods, compared well for the Ekofisk Region. The model predicted higher concentrations than the field-based methods for parts of the Tampen Region; particularly the most tidally influenced areas. Tidally-mediated fluctuations in PAH concentrations in surface water must be considered because they affect the estimation of PAH concentrations from mussel and SPMD residue data, and the predictions by the DREAM model. Predictions using mussels, SPMDs, and modeling support and complement each other; all are valuable tools for estimating the fate and impact of chemical contaminants in produced water that are discharged to the ocean.

In particular, the effects of (1) time-of-day and days-on-shift as well as (2) acute and chronic sleep loss on the rate at which fatigue accumulates were investigated.Methods: 42 day-shift offshore workers were examined. Fatigue was measured using pre- and post-shift scores on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Total sleep time was measured using actigraphy (Motionwatch8, Camntech). Data was analyzed using a linear mixed model analyses.Results: Average sleep loss per night was 92 min (95%CI: 89.6-94.0; p <.001). Mean cumulative sleep loss across the study was 21:20hrs (SD = 08:10hrs) over the 14 days. Chronic sleep loss was significantly related to a modest increase in sleepiness (KSS) across the shift (95%CI: 0.01-0.17; p =.020) and in post-shift scores (95%CI:.07-0.19; p <.001). Time-of-day (95%CI: 0.63 to 0.01; p =.042) and days-on-shift (95%CI: 0.03-0.08; p <.001) as well as their interaction (95%CI: 0.08 to 0.00; p =.027) influenced the rate at which fatigue accumulated over a two-week offshore period.Conclusions: Pre- and post-shift fatigue accumulate in different ways over the two-week offshore period. The accumulation of post-shift fatigue scores was positively related to successive days-on-shift and chronic sleep loss. Our results suggest that prolonging offshore periods will likely result in elevated fatigue risk. Accumulating fatigue and sleep loss over two-week offshore periods should be considered in fatigue risk management plans and systems.",,,,,,,,,14,1,0,0,2,0,16,,,0003-6870,1872-9126,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Hlth Sci Community & Occupat Med, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 AV Groningen, NetherlandsKarolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Nobels Vag 9, S-17177 Stockholm, SwedenStockholm Univ, Stress Res Inst, Frescati Hagvag 16 A, SE-10691 Stockholm, SwedenCent Queensland Univ Australia, Appleton Inst Behav Sci, Adelaide Campus,44 Greenhill Rd, Wayville, SA 5034, AustraliaVrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Hlth Sci, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,,,2019-06-04,WOS:000468251600016,31046947,

Carbon dioxide system including DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon), Alk (alkalinity), pH and pCO(2) (partial pressure of CO2) in multilayered waters of the Yellow Sea was studied for the first time in March and May 2005. The results show that: DIC and Alk are obviously enriched in SML. The contents of DIC, Alk and pCO(2) become lower in turn from SML, SSL to SL, higher in March and lower in May, whereas for pH it was opposite. The relationship between DIC and Alk is clearly positive, but negative between pH and pCO(2). Meanwhile, pCO(2) and temperature/salinity is also in positive relation, pCO(2) decreases with latitude increase. DIC and Alk show a similar variation trend with the maximum at 02:00-03:00, but pH and pCO(2) show an opposite pattern. In addition, the distribution patterns are similar to each other in the three layers.

The Norwegian assumption that northern oil and gas is of interest to the international community is tested by analysing and explaining the character of the US approach, with an assessment of whether Norway has succeeded in influencing how the USA views the high north as an energy region. Norway has managed to raise the awareness of the high north as an energy region in Washington, but the interest in the topic has been moderate. Moreover, Norwegian policy makers in the first phase of the high north initiative have misinterpreted US officials' definition of the situation in which Washington's foreign energy policy is developed. Ironically, Norway's 'exemplary' energy policy hits led to less response than was initially expected, whereas Russia seems to be of significantly greater interest for the USA. With its relatively small resource potential, straightforward investment climate and unclear high north strategy, Norway and its high north do not stand out as very interesting to the USA, which tends to direct more attention to cases in which its oil and gas companies work under more uncertain investment framework conditions in regions with huge energy resources.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,0032-2474,1475-3057,,,,,,,,,,"Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, NO-1326 Lysaker, Norway",Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000262568600006,,

Exploration and extraction for gas hydrate is a nascent science in international scenario and varies with reference to the different site conditions. Methane hydrate is solid clathrate compound that can trap small hydrocarbon natural gas within polyhedral cages formed from hydrogen-bonded water molecules at low temperature and high pressure conditions. Natural occurrence of methane hydrates are reported from permafrost regions and deep ocean marine settings. In India gas hydrates were found to be available in Krishna-Godhavari (KG) basin, Mahanadi basin and Andaman Basin. Occurrence of gas hydrates varies with reference to the different settings with a maximum of thickness of 120 m in fractured clays in KG basin at a water depth of 1000 m and 40m below seafloor. Gas hydrate extraction techniques can be classified under the categories of thermal stimulation, depressurization and inhibitor injection. Each methodology has its own advantage and disadvantages. Phase changes are the key requirement to understand reservoir behavior when applying the gas hydrate extraction technique. This article deals with heat transfer mechanism by thermal stimulation in combination with de-pressurization concept for methane gas extraction. By using thermal stimulation technique, it is possible to confine the energy delivery into the gas hydrate bearing reservoir to dissociate the reservoir for methane production. Since the overburden materials are unconsolidated montmorillonite type clays with high water content and swelling nature, stability of the reservoir in sustainable way is the challenge. By considering the reservoir settings, simulations were performed using MATLAB and TOUGH + HYDRATE software with the results from laboratory studies. Results indicate that it is possible to raise the temperature of gas hydrate bearing sediments to the extent required for dissociation. Experiments were performed using the bentonite clay prepared with matching water content and having similar thermal conductivity to the gas hydrate reservoir associated sediment conditions. It is also observed that the heating the low thermal conductivity sediments bearing reservoir had limitations which could be overcome by combining with the depressurization to pump out the dissociated water in the reservoir. This will work as depressurization concept for further enhancing the dissociation of surrounding reservoir. The energy balance results show that the energy supplied and produced could be better than the ratio of 1: 4. An approach on sustainable extraction and the practical challenges in realizing a field scale system with reference to Indian gas-hydrate reservoir settings are dealt.",,,,,Oceans ConferenceOceans Conference,"APR 07-10, 2014APR 07-10, 2014",,"Taipei, TAIWANTaipei, TAIWAN",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4799-3646-5,,,,,,,,,"Minist Earth Sci, Natl Inst Ocean Technol, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India",,,,2014-01-01,WOS:000412588000149,,

Recent findings have also shown that methylotrophs, including Methylophaga, were in a heightened state of metabolic activity within oil plume waters during the active phase of the spill. Taken collectively, these findings suggest that members of this group may have participated in the degradation of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons in plume waters.

To structure our review, we employ the framework of sequential stages in the innovation process, with which we code each NETs article in innovation space. We find that while there is a growing body of innovation literature on NETs, 59% of the articles are focused on the earliest stages of the innovation process, 'research and development' (R&D). The subsequent stages of innovation are also represented in the literature, but at much lower levels of activity than R&D. Distinguishing between innovation stages that are related to the supply of the technology (R&D, demonstrations, scale up) and demand for the technology (demand pull, niche markets, public acceptance), we find an overwhelming emphasis (83%) on the supply side. BECCS articles have an above average share of demand-side articles while direct air carbon capture and storage has a very low share. Innovation in NETs has much to learn from successfully diffused technologies; appealing to heterogeneous users, managing policy risk, as well as understanding and addressing public concerns are all crucial yet not well represented in the extant literature. Results from integrated assessment models show that while NETs play a key role in the second half of the 21st century for 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C scenarios, the major period of new NETs deployment is between 2030 and 2050. Given that the broader innovation literature consistently finds long time periods involved in scaling up and deploying novel technologies, there is an urgency to developing NETs that is largely unappreciated. This challenge is exacerbated by the thousands to millions of actors that potentially need to adopt these technologies for them to achieve planetary scale. This urgency is reflected neither in the Paris Agreement nor in most of the literature we review here. If NETs are to be deployed at the levels required to meet 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C targets, then important post-R&D issues will need to be addressed in the literature, including incentives for early deployment, niche markets, scale-up, demand, and-particularly if deployment is to be hastened-public acceptance.",,,,,,,,,203,4,0,0,40,0,212,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Wisconsin Madison, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, 1225 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USAMercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15,EUREF Campus 19, D-10829 Berlin, GermanyTech Univ Berlin, Str 17,Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, GermanyUniv Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, EnglandUniv Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Inst Geol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, GermanyPotsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, GermanyUniv Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, 23 St Machar Dr, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland",Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change,,,2018-06-01,WOS:000432858900002,,

Vessel collisions are a serious threat to the right whale and the program was among the first formal attempts to reduce this threat. Under the provisions of the MSR, all ships >300 gross tons are required to report their location, speed, and destination to a shore-based station when entering two key right whale habitats: one in waters off New England and one off coastal Georgia and Florida. In return, reporting ships receive an automatically-generated message, delivered directly to the ship's bridge, that provides information about right whale vulnerability to vessel collisions and actions mariners can take to avoid collisions. The MSR has been in operation continuously from July 1999 to the present. Archived incoming reports provided a 15-plus year history of ship operations in these two locations. We analyzed a total of 26,772 incoming MSR messages logged between July 1999 and December 2013. Most ships that were required to report did so, and compliance rates were generally constant throughout the study period. Self-reported vessel speeds when entering the systems indicated that most ships travelled between 10 and 16 (range = 5-20+) knots. Ship speeds generally decreased in 2009 to 2013 following implementation of vessel speed restrictions. The number of reports into the southern system remained relatively constant following a steady increase through 2007, but numbers in the northern system decreased annually beginning in 2008. If reporting is indicative of long-term patterns in shipping operations, it reflects noteworthy changes in marine transportation. Observed declines in ship traffic are likely attributable to the 2008-2009 economic recession, the containerized shipping industry making increased use of larger ships that made fewer trips, and diminished oil/gas US imports as previously inaccessible domestic deposits were exploited. Recent declines in shipping activity likely resulted in lowered collision risks for right whales and reduced their exposure to underwater noise from ships.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,10,0,15,,,2167-8359,,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Off Protected Resources, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USANOAA, Ocean Associates Inc, Contract Off Protected Resources, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Silver Spring, MD USANOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Gloucester, MA USANOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Woods Hole, MA USAUS Coast Guard, Atlantic Area Command Maritime Secur, Portsmouth, VA USALaw Enforcement Sect, Portsmouth, VA USAFish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, St Petersburg, FL USANOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Fernandina Beach, FL USA",US Coast GuardLaw Enforcement Sect,,,2015-03-31,WOS:000352299200003,25861555,

Maritime fuel combustion currently contributes 3% of the annual global greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly all shipping-related emissions occur within 400 km of land and cause death and morbidity to millions of people. The initial greenhouse gas strategy on the reduction of carbon emissions to at least half of its 2008 levels by 2050, adopted by the International Maritime Organization, has the potential to spur innovations and alternative fuel, enabling the shipping industry to adapt to future challenges. Some zero-emission options such as the use of hydrogen and biofuels are considered potential strategies, but they lack the infrastructure capacity needed to meet the world's shipping demand. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) has gained substantial interest as a marine fuel because it can comply with the strictest environmental regulations currently in force, and it is often regarded as a future fuel as most newly constructed ships are built to run on it. Although the use of LNG leads to lower CO2 emissions compared to traditional heavy fuel oils (HFOs), there is still a need to consider further reduction. A solution which can be implemented is the use of an onboard capture system on ships, also known as ship-based carbon capture. In this study, a process and economic evaluation was carried out on a solvent-based postcombustion capture process for the energy system of a CO2 carrier. A rate-based model was developed, validated, and scaled up to process the flue gas from a Wartsila 9L46 DF marine diesel engine. Different modes of operation with respect to engine load and capture rate were analyzed in this study, and the capture cost was estimated. The cost of CO2 capture was used as an economic index for this study. It was observed via a sensitivity analysis that, at 90% capture rate, the cost of capture was at least $117/t. The effect of exhaust gas recycling was also explored, and this resulted in a considerable reduction in the capture cost. The exhaust gas waste heat was utilized and was adequate to supply the required energy needed by the reboiler at each capture rate examined. Also, for LNG-fueled CO2 ships, the cold energy obtained while converting the LNG to gas was utilized to liquefy the captured CO2 from the flue gas.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,0,17,,,0888-5885,,,,,,,,,,,"Cranfield Univ, Sch Energy Water & Environm, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",,,,2020-04-28,WOS:000526339100017,,

The production of produced water is over three fold of the oil production. The water-cut has increased over time and continues to do so because the fraction of oil in the reservoir decreases and it is more difficult to get the oil out from an old oil-field. It therefore requires more sea water to be injected in order to force the oil out; hence more produced water is generated. Produced water can pollute the environment if it is not treated properly. In this research, produced water will be treated biologically using bacterial consortium which is isolated from petroleum processing facility with Molecular Imprinted Hydrogel Polymer (MIHP) for microbial immobilization media. Microbial growth rate is determined by measuring the MLVSS and hydrogel mass, also by SEM-EDS analysis. SEM-EDS analysis is an analysis to evidence the presence of microbe trapped in hydrogel, and also to determine the types and weight of the molecules of hydrogel. From this research, suspended microbial growth rate was found at 0.1532/days and attached microbial growth rate was 0.3322/days. Furthermore, based on SEM analysis, microbe is entrapped inside the hydrogel. Effectiveness of microbial degradation activity was determined by measuring organic materials as COD.

However, this approach is becoming obsolete due to changes in communication technology such as a switch to unlisted mobile phones. Other methods, such as boat ramp interviews, are often impractical due to high labor cost. We trialed an autonomous, ultra-high-resolution photosampling method as a cost effect solution for direct measurements of a recreational fishery. Our sequential photosampling was batched processed using a novel software application to produce big data time series movies from a spatial subset of the fishery, and we validated this with a regional bus-route survey and interviews with participants at access points. We also compared labor costs between these two methods. Most trailer boat users were recreational fishers targeting tuna spp. Our camera system closely matched trends in temporal variation from the larger scale regional survey, but as the camera data were at much higher frequency, we could additionally describe strong, daily variability in effort. Peaks were normally associated with weekends, but consecutive weekend tuna fishing competitions led to an anomaly of high effort across the normal weekday lulls. By reducing field time and batch processing imagery, Monthly labor costs for the camera sampling were a quarter of the bus-route survey; and individual camera samples cost 2.5% of bus route samples to obtain. Gigapixel panoramic camera observations of fishing were representative of the temporal variability of regional fishing effort and could be used to develop a cost-efficient index. High-frequency sampling had the added benefit of being more likely to detect abnormal patterns of use.

The sensor measurement using factory calibrations for the LI-CO2 820 is typically within 1 micromol/mol of the reference gas value. If the LI-COR 820 measurements and the CO2-in-air reference gas values are different by more than 2 micromol/mol, a correction is applied to Li-CO2 820 output based the reference gas values. A seawater bath operated over a range of temperatures and CO2 expected in the field is then used to check the MapCO2 system (equilibrator and LI-COR 820 measurement) against a General Oceanics 8050 CO2 sensor to ensure the systems agree within 2 micromol/mol. Pressure measurements are made using the LI-COR 820 pressure sensor, checked against a Druck DPI142 pressure indicator and verified to agree within 0.5 kPa before and after each deployment.

For instance, mooring lines may provide 80% of the total LF surge motion damping of a moored tanker in water depth of 200 m, thus reducing the floater resonant excursion significantly. Therefore, when designing truncated mooring system for model testing, mooring damping equivalence should be considered. Thus, simple but effective method for predicting mooring line damping is required for designing truncated mooring system. Different with other quasi-static methods for estimating mooing line damping, besides normal drag forces, tangential drag forces and seabed friction are also considered in the improved quasi-static model presented in this paper. The analytical results based on the improved method are compared to other quasi-static and time domain results for a chain mooring line and a wire line.

The system enables determination of daily radiation fluxes over the entire Baltic Sea employing data from satellites in combination with data from numerical prognostic models. Data from satellite radiometers like SEVIRI, AVHRR are used together with algorithms that take into account the specificity of this sea and are developed based on large empirical data sets collected in this region. A verification of the system has been carried out based on separate, empirical data collected in 2015 on the oil rig Plat placed on the Baltic Sea and Svenska Hogarna station. The analysis showed that daily average NET had been calculated with RMSD of 15 Wm(-2) and R-2 = 0.95 for the South Baltic. For downward radiation fluxes in the solar wavelength range (SW) and the terrestrial, thermal wavelength range (LW) RMSD is respectively 11.9 Wm(-2) and 9.6 Wm(-2) and in both cases increase with latitude. The NET components estimated using SBRB were also compared with the corresponding magnitudes OSI -303-a and OSI 304-a from OSI SAF, EBAF surface Edition 4.0 from CERES and ERA-interim data from ECMWF systems. The main reasons for the discrepancies are discussed. The analyses confirmed the advisability of using local solutions which ensure high accuracy and spatial resolution.SBRB was developed and implemented as part of the comprehensive SatBaltyk System designed to monitor the Baltic Sea environment.

Because the global navigation satellite system cannot be used for underwater dynamic gravimetry, we developed a new method based on underwater multisensor integrated navigation, in which a federal Kalman filter was applied for error estimation.

Dominant bacteria shifted substantially over time and were dependent on relative quantities of different hydrocarbon fractions. Unmitigated flow from the wellhead early in the spill resulted in the highest proportions of n-alkanes and cycloalkanes at depth and corresponded with dominance by Oceanospirillaceae and Pseudomonas. Once partial capture of oil and gas began 43 days into the spill, petroleum hydrocarbons decreased, the fraction of aromatic hydrocarbons increased, and Colwellia, Cycloclasticus, and Pseudoalteromonas increased in dominance. Enrichment of Methylomonas coincided with positive shifts in the delta C-13 values of methane in the plume and indicated significant methane oxidation occurred earlier than previously reported. Anomalous oxygen depressions persisted at plume depths for over six weeks after well shut-in and were likely caused by common marine heterotrophs associated with degradation of high-molecular-weight organic matter, including Methylophaga.

Since the 1960s, the UK has enjoyed the benefits of a domestic supply of oil and gas but most of the focus and much of the production has been from offshore reserves. Onshore oil production, though it exists, has received much less attention until recently, with the potential for commercial exploitation of onshore oil and gas (OOG) from shales and other tight formations. Appropriate regulatory control and protection of the environment and human health will be crucial to any successful exploitation of these opportunities and will rely on understanding the risks of these operations based on sound scientific evidence. Unfortunately our current knowledge of existing natural linkages is incomplete, either because the data doesn't exist, or more likely because it hasn't been compiled appropriately. Potential pathways that will be examined include faults, unconformities, sedimentary linkages, karst systems, boreholes, mineshafts and mines.The project proposes to use the National Geological Model, in particular the GB3D Bedrock Fence Diagram (http://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/ukgeology/nationalGeologicalModel/GB3D.html compiled by the British Geological Survey in conjunction with the Environment Agency) and other data sources and models to develop a national model that will support regulation of the OOG industry, thereby ensuring environmentally sustainable exploitation. The project will follow a staged approach starting with an extensive user consultation, the establishment of the methodology and the cataloging of nationally available datasets and models. The data and models will be synthesised in a three-dimensional Geoscience Information System to develop a prototype source - pathway - receptor analysis tool.

Contrary to the international scholarly tradition, which views wrecking as an activity of the common people, this article sheds light on the deceptive and opportunistic activities of manorial lords, who were responsible for enforcing the law at the local level by performing police and court functions, but who, at the same time, benefited on a large scale from wrecking. The article contrasts this with the opportunities coastal peasants had to wreck for their own profit. In wrecking and salvage, the three characteristic elements of peasant-landlord relationships - exploitation, partnership, and patronage - emerge.

Mittels einer qualitativen Analyse narrativer Quellen werden die auf dem Strandrecht beruhenden Aktivitaten sowohl der Grundherren als auch ihrer Bauern untersucht. Entgegen einer international verbreiteten, traditionellen Forschungsmeinung, derzufolge die Aneignung von Strandgut eine Tatigkeit gewohnlicher Leute war, wirft der Beitrag ein Licht auf die betrugerischen und opportunistischen Aktivitaten der Grundherren. Diese waren einerseits fur die Durchsetzung der Gesetze auf lokaler Ebene verantwortlich, etwa indem sie polizeiliche und gerichtliche Funktionen ubernahmen, sie profitierten aber andererseits auch im gro ss en Ma ss stab von der Aneignung von Strandgut. Im Beitrag wird dies mit den Gelegenheiten verglichen, die sich aus dem Strandrecht fur die in Kustennahe lebenden Bauern ergaben.

En el articulo se contrata este aspecto con las oportunidades de desguazar que tenian los campesinos de las regiones costeras para su propio beneficio. En las practicas de desguace y de rescate se nos muestran los tres elementos caracteristicos de las relaciones entre campesinos y senores -explotacion, colaboracion y patronazgo-. En contraste con los estudios que se centran en las fricciones entre los campesinos y sus senores en regiones dominadas por el feudalismo, en este articulo se sostiene que a lo largo del periodo la colaboracion entre ambos grupos se mantenia sin demasiadas situaciones conflictivas.

In fact, algorithms designed to estimate carbon export from satellite products incorporate fundamentally different assumptions about the relationships between plankton biomass, productivity, and export efficiency. To test the alternate formulations of export efficiency in remote-sensing algorithms formulated by Dunne et al. (2005), Laws et al. (2011), Henson et al. (2011), and Siegel et al.

A food-web based approach formulated by Siegel et al. (2014) performs as well or better than other empirical formulations, while simultaneously providing reasonable estimates of protozoan and mesozooplankton grazing rates. By tuning the Siegel et al.

Adequate representations of food-web relationships and grazing dynamics are therefore crucial to improving the accuracy of export predictions made from satellite-derived products.

However, influence of global warming on structure durability was not considered in the issued code. This would overestimate the durability of concrete structures. In this paper, a reliability based method was adopted to evaluate the influence of climate change on the durability of offshore RC bridges considering the acceleration of chloride ion penetration caused by temperature rise. Two climate change scenarios according to IPCC report were considered to define the global warming. A baseline scenario, in which the mean average temperature equals to that of the year 2000, were defined. It is found that the amount of chloride ion on the surface of reinforcing steel bar in the global warming scenarios are 6%-15% higher than that of structure in the baseline scenario.

In-situ burning (ISB), along with the use of chemical herders (to thicken the slick of spilled oil) has emerged as a potentially viable oil-spill response technique for various Arctic scenarios. The purpose of this research review is to document the field use, research, and analysis regarding the use of ISB to address an offshore oil spill response in the Arctic, with a specific focus on the use of chemical herders to aid ISB in Arctic waters. The compilation of this work involved a systematic review of available experimental data, studies on actual spill-response events, and resulting recommendations on this topic. Both peer-reviewed and available gray literature from the early 1970s through 2018 were evaluated. Selection criteria centered on herders for use with ISBs, Arctic conditions as they relate to ISB, and operational windows of opportunity and environmental risk for this type of oil spill response. From the available literature, more than a hundred articles are referenced herein, and annotated summaries provided. There is general agreement that ISB should be classified as a viable response option for the Arctic offshore to be implemented as part of a multi-layered approach (ASTM 2014; Fritt-Rasmussen et al. 2017; NRC 2014; Rolandsen 2018). In addition, there continue to be gaps noted concerning the availability of monitoring/surveillance personnel and equipment, and logistical/safety considerations for working in the Arctic, as well as specific information on the fate and potential impact of herders and burn residue on Arctic receptors (NRC 2014; Nuka 2016; US-DOI and USGS 2011). This review provides background information for researchers, responders, decision-makers, communities, and is a resource when developing and approving an oil spill response plan or planning future research which includes the use of ISB and herders.

As a result, suppliers of such systems normally take a cautious and deliberate approach to the introduction of new technologies. Development involving the construction of a prototype and deployment at sea may last years. Even incremental improvements may require extensive qualification tests stretching over eighteen months or more. Entirely novel approaches may be shelved due to the cost of trials or test deployments.Science communities around the world are installing, or proposing to install, a new generation of cabled infrastructure that will provide standard communications and power interfaces in the deep ocean. The first of these large scale observatories, NEPTUNE Canada, is scheduled for final deployment in 2008. While the primary goal of cabled ocean observatories is observation of the ocean environment, engineering research is also encouraged, and facilities can be made available for use demonstration and qualification of new technologies.The primary interfaces to NEPTUNE Canada are the node science ports. Each science port provides optical Gigabit Ethernet connection and up to 9 kW of power at 400 Volts DC. These interfaces are suitable for connection of equipment within a few kilometres of the node. For longer extensions, a power interface providing a direct connection to backbone power at 5 to 10 kV, and long reach optics are available.The NEPTUNE Canada physical infrastructure consists of an 800 kin loop beginning and ending at Port Alberni British Columbia. NEPTUNE nodes are located at depths ranging from 100m to 2700m, which encompasses the range at which most commercial subsea activity takes place. There are active hot volcanic vents, outcrops of gas hydrates and existing ODP drill holes adjacent to the planned node sites.These capabilities make the new generation of ocean observatories, and NEPTUNE Canada in particular, an ideal test bed for any application requiring high bandwidth communication and hundreds or thousands of watts of electrical power.Communication between the nodes and shore is provided via Ethernet and wavelength division multiplexed optics.

Field measurements across the Arctic have documented long-term and gradual warming of permafrost and recently the observations have also included rapid ice-wedge degradation in response to a single and unusually warm summer. The goal of this project is to understand the complex and interlinked processes responsible for the evolution of the pan-Arctic ice-wedge polygon tundra landscape by combining field measurements from nine Canadian, Russian, and Alaskan field sites, numerical modeling, and very high spatial resolution optical imagery that has recently become available for the entire Arctic tundra domain. A combination of detailed imagery and advanced processing algorithms will allow pan-Arctic mapping of ice-wedge polygon extent and types (low- and high-centered). A map of that extent and detail does not yet exisxt, but is necessary to link carbon, water, and energy processes occurring at the ice-wedge polygon scale to the larger Arctic land-ocean-atmosphere system. Currently, permafrost thaw and subsequent carbon release is, at best, described in global models via gradual increases in active layer thickness, while field observations clearly show additional dramatic changes to the tundra ecosystem due to rapid differential ground subsidence as ice-wedges melt. A low-centered polygon landscape, which evolved over several thousand years via the slow process of ice-wedge growth, can harbor a sea of shallow ponds throughout the summer that supports a myriad of migratory birds during the breeding season. In just two years, the scene could change dramatically with exposed dry mounds where the shallow water bodies once were, while the surface water area can shrink into narrow elongated beads of deeper ponds above the melted ice-wedges. A complicated set of sub-polygon to watershed scale responses will determine the fate of the landscape. These mechanisms, part of the soil-vegetation-water continuum, will be defined via a numerical biogeophysical model informed by field measurements and repeat imagery of ice-wedge evolution. The new knowledge will support the research community in refining the role of the Arctic in the global climate system. Broader impacts of this project include training of the new generation of Arctic researchers by supporting a graduate student, a post-doctoral fellow, and an early-career scientist. Fairbanks, Alaska, the base for several of the investigators, offers an excellent opportunity to show K-12 students the results of ice-wedge degradation. The products, such as the maps of ice-wedge polygon types and the projected transformation of the vegetation, water, and topography, are at spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to managers. Digital maps of ice-wedge polygon type and ground-ice estimates will be given to state and federal agencies operating in Alaska in a half-day workshop along with ice-wedge polygon ecosystem projections. The information could inform management decisions about habitat protection, or surface-water dependent oil and gas exploration activities.

Final report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD) as part of the Defra Horizon Scanning Programme.",,,,,,,,1,38,,,,,,,,,,,Book,2006,2006,"Renewable energy (RE) sources are central to the Government's energy strategy for the next 50 years (DTI, 2003). The UK is committed under the Kyoto Protocol to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5%, relative to 1990 levels, by 2010. The UK also has a domestic commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by 2020 and by 60% by 2050. As part of a basket of other climate change-related policies and measures, the UK's Renewables Obligation aims to supply 10% of electricity from renewable sources by 2010, 15% by 2015 and to reach an aspirational target of 20% by 2020. This study has reviewed the potential impacts of renewable energy sources on UK biodiversity and assessed how biodiversity in the future may be affected by a growth in these types of technology. The renewable energy technologies considered are those where the energy source may be wholly derived from non-fossil fuel sources: Onshore wind, Biomass crops (including agricultural residues, forestry residues and energy crops), Small scale hydro (<5MW), Novel technologies (solar water heating (SWH), ground source heat pumps (GSHP), photovoltaic (PV) and hydrogen fuel cells), Offshore wind, Marine current, and Tidal energy sources. The review has been undertaken using a risk assessment methodology to produce a series of impact matrices, with the effects summarised by Broad Habitat type to provide a comparison across the different technologies. A brief review of the impacts of conventional technologies has also been provided to set the context against which the impacts of renewable technologies may be assessed. All the renewable energy technologies reviewed have some negative effect on the biodiversity of their locality. These effects may be slight and often temporary, such as disturbance of feeding patterns of fauna during construction operations, or they may be highly significant permanent and widespread impacts, such as loss of a habitat through flooding for small-scale hydroelectric schemes. Some technology types also have the capacity to enhance biodiversity and whilst such enhancements are generally slight and affected by the level of existing biodiversity, the changes can also be highly significant and they are usually permanent. Of the renewable energy sources examined, novel technologies appear to present least risk to UK biodiversity, at least in terms of their operation (risks associated with materials sourcing need to be considered). Within this technology type, it is photovoltaics that provide least direct impact upon biodiversity, provided that mining, manufacturing and recycling are subject to stringent environmental requirements. But their rate of future development, even in a best-case assessment, suggests that this technology is unlikely to provide more than 10% of the renewables target by 2020 (i.e. 2% of national energy demand). Solar water heating and ground source heat pumps (GHSP) may also have indirect biodiversity benefits by reducing electricity demand (both through the provision of heat and, for GSHP, cooling). However, biodiversity impact assessment needs also to consider the scale at which energy will be generated from each technology type, both in terms of the size of the power generation unit and the number in operation. The study considered scenarios for future levels of contribution from different renewable energy sources in order to assess possible biodiversity impacts of scaling up renewable energy output. The scenarios examined assumed major contributions from wind and biomass technologies to the 2020 target and examined cases where each of these energy sources was in turn further enhanced. The assessment of the size and scale required for renewable sources to meet the 2020 targets demonstrated that only a small area of UK land or seabed is required for each technology considered in the scenarios. Hence, it is anticipated that the future energy generation scenarios presented could be met with minimal impacts on biodiversity, if: (a) Renewable energy developments avoid sites of high biodiversity interest, (b) All the suggested mitigation measures for all energy sectors are implemented and effective, and (c) Multiple sources of biomass fuel are utilised. The issue of mitigation is critical and it highlights the need for research and post-construction monitoring at consented installations to test the effectiveness of mitigation measures. Such monitoring and assessment should be published to facilitate the spread of best practice. The land take required for sufficient production of biomass fuels in the UK means that it is unlikely to make up more than 5-20% of the 2020 target, without having a major impact on the area of agricultural land needed, unless large quantities of fuel are imported. But the issue of scale of planting for biomass production is also important in determining the nature and, to some extent, the direction (positive or negative) of its impact on biodiversity. The provision of smaller scale plantings of biomass has a stronger positive effect on biodiversity than large-scale plantings. Small-scale Combined Heat and Power (CHP) generation through biomass burning would also provide an indirect biodiversity benefit through improved energy efficiency, since heat demand in the UK currently uses around 50% of primary energy. However, the economic viability of CHP plants may depend on the extent to which the heat energy produced can be used directly. In cases where larger areas of biomass crop are required, guidelines aimed at ensuring biodiversity within the plantations may help offset the effect of plantation scale. Currently these are best developed for short rotation coppice (SRC) plantation design, with the specific aim of increasing the biodiversity value of the crop by including features such as rides, headlands and stands of different age-class to increase habitat heterogeneity. Further guidance is needed to maximise biodiversity benefits and minimise impacts for other crop types. The biodiversity impact of importing biomass fuel depends upon the type of fuel sourced, the country of origin and the measures in place within that country to reduce biodiversity impacts. The use of international supplies may result in considerable biodiversity impact outside of the UK, with no potential for mitigation measures to be enforced. At the very least biomass fuel should be sourced from countries where minimum acceptable standards of biodiversity protection are ensured, to avoid exporting negative effects of this technology. Assessment of the biodiversity impacts of biomass fuels in potential source countries would help to guide sourcing of such materials if it is necessary. Wind energy is likely to provide the largest proportion of the renewable energy target by 2020. But there remain some fundamental gaps in knowledge of the impacts on biodiversity and the effectiveness of some mitigation proposals, such as tailored turbine layouts to aid bird species' movements. Post-construction monitoring is mostly in its infancy, with rather little UK experience on which to draw, so far, and most of that experience relates to small installations and/or small turbine size. Monitoring programmes now in place are starting to deliver results that will make an essential contribution to the knowledge base relating to impacts of wind energy generation on biodiversity, notably birds. These need to be analysed and summarised into guidelines for developers to provide an indication of best practice for effective mitigation measures. In particular, a comparison needs to be made of the impacts of different turbine sizes on biodiversity. The biodiversity impact of individual house turbines (particularly if widely used in urban areas) has not yet been assessed. It has been suggested that the intermittency of wind power generation may be partially offset by importing electricity from Europe. However, this may only create biodiversity problems elsewhere. An assessment is needed of the biodiversity impacts of energy sources in other EU countries in order that such effects may be minimised internationally as well as in the UK. There is considerable uncertainty about the potential impacts of marine energy generation on biodiversity. There is little evidence about the effects of the type and scale of wave and tidal technologies that are most appropriate for the UK. The effects of developing technologies, in particular, are unclear since many are still at the early experimental stages. The current understanding of impacts or potential impacts arises largely from large-scale tidal barrages, but the likely nature and scale of impacts arising from the new marine technologies are thought to be different and/or of a lower order of magnitude. It is important that potential impacts on biodiversity, as indicated in the significance matrices, are researched from an early stage and that these studies continue into the scaling-up phases of development of these technologies. Further research. A number of areas have been identified from this assessment as requiring further research. Knowledge gaps are greatest within the marine environment for the relatively new wave and tidal technologies, particularly the developing technologies. The scale of energy production units and the number of units operating are both important aspects in determining biodiversity impacts, but there is insufficient understanding of their interaction for most renewable technologies. For onshore wind and biomass technologies, there is less known about the effects of widespread, small-scale developments than about the effects of large-scale production. Conversely for marine technologies there is a need to determine the impacts of scaling-up to large energy generation systems from the small-scale demonstration units. For novel technologies the impacts of widespread use of PV panels on the risk of bird collision needs further study. On-going monitoring and analysis are required to assess the effectiveness of existing and evolving UK and country-level policy, land use planning and legal mechanisms to mitigate renewable energy impacts on biodiversity, with particular reference to the need for rationalising, coordinating and improving controls in the marine environment. Publication of such assessments is important to highlight and encourage best practice.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2006-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14503017815,,

Consequently, several polls have been conducted over time to gauge public attitude towards offshore drilling. Nevertheless, the economic literature on this issue is sparse. This paper contributes to the literature and analyzes support for offshore drilling based on demographic, economic, social, belief, and shock (e.g. spill) factors. The data is taken from ten nationwide surveys conducted before, during and after the British Petroleum (BP) oil spill and analyzed within the framework of discrete choice model. The results from an ordinal probit model demonstrate that age, annual household income, affiliation to Republican Party, and residence in oil-rich states positively affect the probability of strong support and reduce the probability of strong opposition for offshore drilling. In contrast, the female gender, higher education, association to Democratic Party, and environmental concern affect opinion in opposite direction. Marginal effects show that belief about environmental consequences of drilling has the highest impact on opinion. Binary probit model also yields a similar result and suggests that BP oil disaster resulted in a transient decrease in support for offshore drilling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Laherrere, J",,,,,,,,,,Oceanic hydrates: More questions than answers,,,,,,,,ENERGY EXPLORATION & EXPLOITATION,,,,18,4,,,349,383,,,,10.1260/0144598001492175,,,,,,,Article,2000,2000,"From an oil industry standpoint, methane hydrate is known as a major problem because it plugs casing and pipelines. From a media standpoint, hydrates provide an almost inexhaustible supply of articles concerning greenhouse effects, landslides, global warming and mysterious events such as the loss of aircraft in the Bermuda Triangle. From a scientific standpoint, they provide much scope for academic research projects.Oceanic hydrates have been recovered in some of the thousands of ODP/Joides boreholes, from which a total of over 250 km of core have been taken. Unfortunately, hydrates dissociate when brought on deck, and few samples were preserved for further analysis. Most of the oceanic hydrates are reported to be of biogenic origin, except where they overlie petroleum reservoirs, as in the Caspian Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The hydrates in the cores are found mostly as dispersed grains or thin laminae. Massive pieces of hydrate, greater than 10cm thick, have been found only at three sites. Downhole logs are unreliable indicates of hydrates due to cave-ins, and in many instances the inferred presence of hydrates depends on indirect evidence, such as seismic reflectors (BSR) or chlorinity changes in pore waters.The oil industry requires much better evidence than this before attributing reserve status to a resource, yet in the case of hydrates, enormous deposits (such as recently declared in New Caledonia) are reported on the strength of no more than uncertain seismic information.The gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) occurs in oceanic sediments over the first few hundred meters below the seabed. In this zone, any methane from organic material, including any seepages from below, is converted into solid hydrate, and is locked in place in the sediments. The origin of the methane is poorly understood, with even its biogenic origin being challenged.Dissolved methane or free gas may precipitate at geological discontinuities such a faults, fractures and lithological boundaries, as well as at water salinity, temperature and pressure interfaces. In the past, the porosity in the GHSZ was thought to be dominantly filled by hydrate, thus providing a seal to gas, at and below the base of the stability zone. However, at the Blake Ridge, ODP Leg 164 found only minor porosity (maximum of about 5%) being filled by hydrate or gas. The recent Leg 172 in the same area failed to find any hydrate at all. A much higher concentration has been indicated in the Japan National Oil Company hydrate borehole in the Nankai Trough, although this is contradicted by other reports.The Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR) seismic reflector is caused mainly by gas bubbles at the base of the stability zone, which accordingly cannot act as a seal because the porosity is more than 95% filled by water, with the size of the pores and the gas bubbles being further factors. This is one reason why the BSR reflector does not correspond with the hydrate zones, as had been assumed. Cascadia, off Oregon, is one of the best places to investigate hydrates, as they crop out on the seafloor whereas on the Blake Ridge the first 200 m lack hydrates.Prior to 1998, the resources of hydrates were often declared to be much greater than all known fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas). Ginsburg (1998) disputed such claims on the grounds that the hydrates are not continuously distributed vertically or horizontally. Mole recently, the USGS (Course 14, AAPG 2000) has drastically reduced its past estimates to a level where it is now claimed that hydrate accumulations may only rival the known reserves of conventional gas. These dispersed hydrate deposits may be better compared with dispersed oil and gas in petroleum systems, which are very much larger than the amounts contained in commercial reservoirs.Many graphs on solubility of methane in water are computed from formulae, being rarely checked by experiments. Measurements in the laboratory seem to differ from field measurements in sediments. The solubility of methane in deep water is but poorly known, as few measurements have been taken, bur it seems to be about a hundred rimes higher than in near surface-water. Methane released in deep ware, is dissolved in water, even when a large amount of methane is released. It cannot accordingly be the cause of any hazards. But little is known about the fate of the deep dissolved methane in upwelling seawater currents.Methane hydrates are less dense than water when on the seafloor down to a certain depth, which is still unknown (2650 m for CO2 hydrate). So, extrusions of hydrate tend to float upwards, disappearing into the seawater. Log measurements in sediments report hydrates being denser than water, but direct measurements are lacking, and it would seem that such sediments are also subject to buoyancy pressure. Surficial pockmarks and mud volcanoes arise from gas expelled from overpressured, underconsolidated sediments - with or without hydrates being present.Progress in understanding oceanic hydrates has not advanced much over the last twenty years because of the poor quality of measurements in soft sediments (cores, samples and logs) and because of the lack of calibration of seismic against a known oceanic hydrate system.The chance of a viable production method being developed is slim because the oceanic hydrates are dispersed and occur in erratic patches. Only national oil companies in Japan and India are actively exploring for them.Future progress may come from the deepwater exploration being undertaken by the oil industry using better tools, but oceanic hydrates seem to be similar in some respects to metallic nodules or gold in seawater-too dispersed to ever prove economic in most places. It is well said that they are a fuel for the future and likely to remain so.",,,,,,,,,14,1,0,0,0,0,15,,,0144-5987,2048-4054,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2000-01-01,WOS:000089646200004,,

Current climate warming is accompanied by deglaciation, increased availability of water, and vegetation establishment in many regions of Antarctica. The effect of these changes on soil P and S availability, ecosystem succession, mineral weathering, and important processes of soil formation and geochemistry (e.g. organic carbon sequestration, formation of secondary minerals) are largely unknown. Detailed knowledge on different P and S pools in soils of Antarctica is required for sound predictions of climate warming effects on important (bio)geochemical processes. We quantified the P and S concentration and speciation for various Antarctic soils using synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and related the soil P and S status to important soil and site properties. The soils, which have mostly remained at an initial stage of pedogenesis, differed considerably with respect to their P and S status. The P stock of most soils was dominated by Ca-bound (apatite) P (60-70% of total P). Some soils showed a marked accumulation of either Al-bound P (up to 60% of total P), Fe-bound P (up to 57%), Na- and K-bound P (up to 37%), or organic P (up to 54%). The S speciation also differed considerably among soils. Similar to other terrestrial environments, we observed a transformation of lithogenic apatite P and sulfide S into Al- and Fe-bound phosphate and sulfate as well as organic S and P. The transformation proceeded much more slowly than in soils with temperate humid climate, reflecting the cold and arid climate as well as the absence of vascular plants. The different P and S status of the soils could be related to the following site factors: (i) Parent material-soils formed from basalt had larger contents of total P as well as Al- and Fe-bound P compared to soils formed from mixture of basalt and sandstone. (ii) Sea spray influence-An upland soil affected by eolian deposition of sea spray showed topsoil enrichment of alkali-bound P, Ca-bound P, and CaSO4. (iii) Inundation by seawater - Soils inundated by seawater had higher total P and S concentrations and higher concentrations of inorganic sulfide than upland soils. (iv) Soil moisture-Soils with increased soil moisture or wet conditions showed increased concentrations of P bound to pedogenic Al and Fe minerals and smaller contributions of Ca-bound (apatite) P to total P than soils under permanently arid conditions. (v) Colonization by mosses-Moss establishment resulted in topsoil P depletion and transformation of apatite P into Al- and Fe-bound P, but also in topsoil S accumulation and conversion of sulfide S into organic S forms. According to our study, the ongoing climate warming in Antarctica at many places will likely change soil P and S speciation as well as P and S availability to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, thus altering key biogeochemical processes like mineral weathering, secondary mineral formation, and soil C sequestration.

As opposed to drying the CO2 stream to excessive levels, one alternative option is the application of corrosion resistant alloys such as 13Cr. This paper performs a comparison between X65 carbon steel and 13Cr in pure and impure CO2, evaluating the influence of SO2 and O-2 on the general and localized corrosion rate of both materials at 80 bar and 35 degrees C. The results show that 13Cr is able to perform exceptionally well in comparison to X65 in pure CO2 as well as when SO2 and O-2 are present in the system individually, producing no localized corrosion and general corrosion rates below 0.02 mm/y. However, when SO2 and O-2 were combined, the formation of sulfuric acid was permitted which proved detrimental to 13Cr, producing excessive localized attack much greater than that observed on X65.

Successful management of this risk requires a precise forecast of the hydrate growth rate. Such predictions should incorporate quantitative descriptions of both deterministic and probabilistic hydrate phenomena. In this work, we present a first step towards such a quantitative risk assessment for systems that form hydrate slurries, based on a consideration of the stochastic nature of hydrate formation. Our framework introduces a new approach to risk assessment, by coupling a laboratory-derived probabilistic nucleation model with existing deterministic calculations for hydrate slurry viscosification. This new approach is used to extend a previously-described hydrate risk algorithm, the Hydrate Flow Assurance Simulation Tool (HyFAST), which enables the rapid assessment of hydrate slurry viscosification using the most advanced models available. Importantly, while the previous version of HyFAST was constrained to calculations in flowloop and autoclave geometries, for which it is sufficient to consider a single volume element, the new version of the HyFAST algorithm allows calculations for flowlines wherein a series of multiple volume elements are considered. The advanced hydrate formation models within this algorithm allow identification of critically important hydrate formation scenarios, and may serve as a screening tool for cases that then require study within rigorous hydrodynamic packages such as OLGA (R) or LedaFlow (R) to examine behaviour during key transient events. By coupling the outputs of our predictive algorithm and quantitative risk framework, we demonstrate a new capability to assess what constitutes an acceptable level of hydrate formation. We use this algorithm in a series of case studies that compare the effectiveness of common hydrate mitigation strategies over the life of a reservoir, including the optimization of a wellhead choke opening for both production rate and hydrate blockage risk.

In this paper, the most effective types of marine power plants were discussed. The history of the development of each type was presented first and the technical aspects were discussed second. Also, the fuel cells as a new type of power plants used in marine sector were briefed to give a complete overview of the past, present and future of the marine power plants development.

This results in the increasing use of energetic resources, especially primary energy carriers: hard coal and lignite, oil and natural gas. Global resources of primary energetic resources (in 2005) were estimated at 900 mid ton (1 ton = 42 GJ).Within the structure of reserves of fossil energetic resources, solid resources (hard coal and lignite) amount to about 540 mld ton, which constitutes about 60% of the global resources.Global hard coal resources are estimated at about 431 mld ton. The USA has the greatest resources of hard coal - about 112.3 mid ton (about 26%), just before China - over 62 mid ton (over 14%). Hard coal in Poland can be found in 136 deposits, however, only 47 of them are managed. Poland has about 43 mid ton of balanced stocks of hard coal, with 16 mid ton of managed deposits, while industrial reserves (extraction resources) constitute only 4.2 mid ton. The extraction of hard coal in Poland in 2007 amounted to about 82.8 mln ton.Global lignite resources amount to about 417 mid ton. The greatest reserves of this carrier belong to the USA - about 130.5 mid ton (more than 31%) and Russia - about 108 mid ton (26%). The efficient resources of lignite in Poland amount to about 1.9 mid ton. The extraction takes place in the four lignite mines (Adamow, Belchatow, Konin and Turow) and in 2007 amounted to 59.6 mln ton.The evidenced global reserves of oil constitute about 160 mid toe (19% of global reserves). The distribution of these resources is very uneven. More than 60% of oil reserves is located in the Middle East, with the three countries - Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq owning about 42% of the global reserves. In Poland, the oil resources have been recorded in 84 deposits and amount to about 23 mln ton, where about 20 mln ton are managed deposits, and about 15 mln ton - industrial resources. The oil extraction in Poland in 2007 amounts to 700.5 thous. ton, including: Polish Plain - 465 thous. ton, Baltic Shelf - 191 thous. ton, the Carpathian Mountains - 26.2 thous. ton and Carpathian Foreland - 18.3 thous. ton.Global natural gas reserves are estimated at about 161 mid toe (about 19% of primary global resources). The unconventional reserves of natural gas (among others - hydrates) are also estimated at about 280 mid toe. The greatest evidenced resources of natural gas occur in the Middle East (more than 40%) as well as in Russia (about 32% of global reserves).In Poland natural gas can be found in 263 deposits, out of which 181 deposits are managed. The balance stocks amount to about 139 mld m(3), with about 108 mld m(3) of the gas in managed deposits. The extraction of natural gas in Poland in 2007 amounted to 5.18 mid m(3), including: Polish Plain - 3 333.9 mln m(3), Carpathian Foreland - 1 798.23 mln m(3), the Carpathian Mountains - 30.3 mln m(3), Baltic Shelf - 21.01 mln m(3).The methane recorded reserves of coal deposits in 51 deposits have been estimated at 99 mid m(3), including 30 deposits in operational areas - 33 mld m(3).There are numerous forecasts for national electric energy demand made by various institutions and authors. All of them (until 2030) assume electric energy production on the basis of primary stable energy carriers, thus, hard coal and lignite.These carriers are burdensome for the environment, since they are characterized by excessive greenhouse gases emission. The growing demand for direct energy, in accordance with ecological conditions, will require the use of clean technologies as well as disposal and deposition of CO2 - that is, CCS technologies (Carbon Capture and Storage). Since Poland joined the European Union in 2004, we have to face and prepare for all the changes which the European Commission has planned for the EU countries. The essential issue is the reduction of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. There are many technologies allowing to capture CO2 from the stream of gases, and consequently, its sequestration by means of storage in the oceans, deep geological layers or mineral carbonation.In 2006 the EU-27 emitted greenhouse gases in the total amount of more than 5.14 mid ton of CO2 equivalent. The greatest emittant of greenhouse gases in the power economy is the power industry, which emitted 1.59 mid ton of CO2 equivalent. The emission of greenhouse gases in Poland amounted to 400.5 mln ton of CO2 equivalent, out of which 330 mln ton is CO2 emission.The international community the - UN, the EU and many developed countries - already in 1990s (and earlier), intended to counteract the negative impact of greenhouse gases and dust emission. The problem of the environment protection is presently a matter of great importance, as far as the strategy of global economy development. It has been the subject-matter of numerous conventions, protocols, conferences, directives, regulations and etc.Polish power industry and energo-chemical industry in 2008 were entitled to emit about 201 mln ton of CO2 (additional in the reserves for the new investments). In the next years coming Poland will not be able to meet the granted emission limits.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,0,13,,,1506-218X,,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Gospodarki Surowcami Mineralnymi & Energia P, Krakow, Poland",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000281370600007,,

A new conceptual formulation of oil-particle coagulation efficiency is introduced to account for the effects of oil stabilization by particles, particle hydrophobicity, and oil-particle size ratio on OPA formation. A-DROP was able to closely reproduce the oil trapping efficiency reported in experimental studies. The model was then used to simulate the OPA formation in a typical nearshore environment Modeling results indicate that the increase of particle concentration in the swash zone would speed up the oil-particle interaction process; but the oil amount trapped in OPAs did not correspond to the increase of particle concentration. The developed A-DROP model could become an important tool in understanding the natural removal of oil and developing oil spill countermeasures by means of oil particle aggregation.

Dynamic tidal power is a new concept for extracting tidal potential energy in which a coast-perpendicular dike is used to create water head and generate electricity via turbines inserted in the dike. Before starting such a project, the potential power output and hydrodynamic impacts of the dike must be assessed. In this study, a two-dimensional numerical model based on the Delft3D-FLOW module is established to simulate tides in China. A dike module is developed to account for turbine processes and estimate power output by integrating a special algorithm into the model. The domain decomposition technique is used to divide the computational zone into two subdomains with grid refinement near the dike. The hydrodynamic processes predicted by the model, both with and without the proposed construction, are examined in detail, including tidal currents and tidal energy flux. The predicted time-averaged power yields with various opening ratios are presented. The results show that time-averaged power yield peaks at an 8% opening ratio. For semidiurnal tides, the flow velocity increases in front of the head of the dike and decreases on either side. For diurnal tides, these changes are complicated by the oblique incidence of tidal currents with respect to the dike as well as by bathymetric features. The dike itself blocks the propagation of tidal energy flux.",,,,,,,,,5,1,0,0,2,0,5,,,1672-5182,1993-5021,,,,,,,,,,"Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaHohai Univ, Coll Harbor Coastal & Offshore Engn, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Hydraul Res Inst, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,,,2017-11-23,WOS:000414791700003,,

In this paper, we will review and assess technical and theoretical aspects of land-based, atmosphere-based, ocean-based and space-based geoengineering schemes as well as their potential impacts on global climate and ecosystem. Most of the proposed geoengineering schemes carried out on land or in the ocean are to use physical, chemical or biological approaches to remove atmospheric CO2. These schemes are able to only sequester an amount of atmospheric CO2 that is small compared with cumulative anthropogenic emissions. Most of geoengineering schemes carried out in the atmosphere or space are based on increasing planetary albedo. These schemes have relatively low costs and short lead times for technical implementation, and can act rapidly to reduce temperature anomalies caused by greenhouse gas emissions. The costs and benefits of geoengineering are likely to vary spatially over the planet with some countries and regions gaining considerably while others may be faced with a worse set of circumstances than would be the case without geoengineering. Since current research on geoengineering is limited and various international treaties may limit some geoengineering experiments in the real world, the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) provides a framework of coordinated experiments for all earth system modeling groups to test geoengineering schemes. However, these experiments used on a global scale have difficulty with accurate resolution of regional and local impacts, so future research on geoengineering is expect to be done by combining earth system models with regional climate models.

Although the most substantial oiling of coastal salt marshes occurred in Louisiana, oiling of salt marshes in Mississippi and Alabama was documented as well. A field study conducted in Mississippi and Alabama salt marshes as a component of the Deepwater Horizon Natural Resource Damage Assessment determined that >10% vertical oiling of plant tissues reduced live vegetation cover and aboveground biomass (live standing crop) relative to reference sites in this region through fall 2012. This reduction of live vegetation cover and aboveground biomass appears to have largely resulted from diminished health and vigor of Juncus roemerianus, a key salt marsh species in Mississippi and Alabama. Fewer significant reductions in live vegetation cover and aboveground biomass were detected by the fall 2013 sampling, suggesting that vegetation in oiled salt marshes in this region may have begun to recover. This is corroborated by low levels of Deepwater Horizon oil contamination in these salt marsh soils.

We quantified carbon (C) density in 20 managed longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forests ranging in age from 5 to 118 years located across the southeastern United States and estimated above-and belowground C trajectories. Ecosystem C stock (all pools including soil C) and aboveground live tree C increased nonlinearly with stand age and the modeled asymptotic maxima were 168 Mg C/ha and 80 Mg C/ha, respectively. Accumulation of ecosystem C with stand age was driven mainly by increases in aboveground live tree C, which ranged from < 1 Mg C/ha to 74 Mg C/ha and comprised < 1% to 39% of ecosystem C. Live root C (sum of below-stump C, ground penetrating radar measurement of lateral root C, and live fine root C) increased with stand age and represented 4-22% of ecosystem C. Soil C was related to site index, but not to stand age, and made up 39-92% of ecosystem C. Live understory C, forest floor C, downed dead wood C, and standing dead wood C were small fractions of ecosystem C in these frequently burned stands. Stand age and site index accounted for 76% of the variation in ecosystem C among stands. The mean root-to-shoot ratio calculated as the average across all stands (excluding the grass-stage stand) was 0.54 (standard deviation of 0.19) and higher than reports for other conifers. Long-term accumulation of live tree C, combined with the larger role of belowground accumulation of lateral root C than in other forest types, indicates a role of longleaf pine forests in providing disturbance-resistant C storage that can balance the more rapid C accumulation and C removal associated with more intensively managed forests. Although other managed southern pine systems sequester more C over the short-term, we suggest that longleaf pine forests can play a meaningful role in regional forest C management.",,,,,,,,,36,2,0,0,23,1,40,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"Auburn Univ, Ctr Longleaf Pine Ecosyst, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USAUniv Vermont, Southern Res Stn, US Forest Serv, USDA,Aiken Ctr, 81 Carrigan Dr,Room 208, Burlington, VT 05405 USAUS Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, USDA, 3041 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 28809 USAUniv Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, POB 110410, Gainesville, FL 32611 USAUS Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, USDA, 1577 Brevard Rd, Asheville, NC 28806 USAOregon State Univ, Dept Forest Engn Resources & Management, Coll Forestry, 269 Peavy Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000391985300020,28052499,

It is demonstrated that Bayesian networks are appropriate for facilitating the re-assessment and re-validation of contingency plans following pollutant release, thus helping ensure that the optimum response strategy is adopted.

A control and six replicated experimental treatments of crude oil additions at final concentrations of 10, 50, or 100 mu l l(-1) of either Deepwater Horizon spill oil or the Texas crude mixture were incubated under in situ conditions. Photopigments were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography and community composition was determined using ChemTax. Total phytoplankton biomass (as chl a) declined with increasing crude oil concentrations. Prasinophytes, the most abundant microalga in both experiments, showed no response to oil exposure in one experiment and a significant negative response in the other. Diatoms euglenophytes and chlorophytes appeared relatively resistant to oil contamination at the exposure levels used in this study, maintaining or increasing their relative abundance with increasing oil concentrations. Chlorophytes and cyanobacteria increased in relative abundance while cryptophyte abundance decreased with increasing oil concentrations. The results of these experiments suggest that low levels of crude oil exposure may reduce total biomass and alter phytoplankton community composition with possible cascade effects at higher trophic levels in salt marsh estuaries.",,,,,,,,,48,11,0,0,46,0,70,,,1559-2723,1559-2731,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Carolina, Marine Sci Program, Columbia, SC 29208 USAUniv S Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",,,,2012-05-01,WOS:000302481200013,,

To develop future sustainable agricultural production and food systems, agronomic, ecological, economic and social challenges have to simultaneously be taken into account. The framework of agroecology applied on the food system could be a useful concept to support this development. Although the scale and dimension of scientific research in agroecology has been enlarged in the last years towards the food system approach, it is still difficult to outline clear concepts, new models and new methods that specify it. In using two contrasted research case studies, we evaluate benefits and challenges using the framework of agroecology applied on the food system.The first case study illustrates research questions around water quality and management of shallow lakes with fish production, biodiversity of the lakes, agricultural land use on the surrounding land, and local fish products and its marketing strategies. It shows that research was initiated by an ecologist working at the lake scale, but implementing quite quickly a systems approach in integrating the disciplines ecology, agronomy, geography, socio-economy and sociology with a food systems approach. The second case study illustrates research questions around organic wheat. production and food chain. It shows the evolution of a research program where research objectives and methodology have been slowly turned from technical questions on nitrogen management of organic wheat, supported by agronomist, applied at field scale, to overall agroecological questions around organic grain producers, raised by economists, sociologists, agronomists and food technologists, focussing on the wheat-flour food chain, applied at farm and food system scales.This chapter underlines the importance of the articulation between disciplines such as agronomy, ecology and social science. In using the food system approach, the indispensable interdisciplinary research is-carried out automatically by integrating other disciplines such as sociology, socio-economy and geography supporting the disciplines of agronomy and ecology. This chapter also shows that in combining already existing research methods from different disciplines, and applying them to different scales, a concept for agroecological analyses of the food system already exists. In conclusion, we propose necessary prerequisites for agroecological research with the food system approach: ex-ante impact anticipation of expected results when starting research, multi-scale and interdisciplinary research as well as scale related impact assessment of proposed recommendations. In considering these prerequisites, quality of agricultural research will substantially improve in the future, and thus contributing in search for more sustainable food systems.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,5,2,18,,,2210-4410,2210-4429,978-94-007-1904-0,,,,,,,,,"ISARA Lyon, Dept Agroecosyst Environm & Prod, F-69364 Lyon 07, France",,,,2013-07-17,WOS:000320563200002,,

Hydrothermal vents are one potential Fe source to this region, but it is not known whether hydrothermal Fe persists in seawater long enough to reach the surface before it is removed by particle scavenging. A new study (Jenkins, 2020, ) fills an important gap in this puzzle: a helium-3 mass balance model is used to show that it takes similar to 100 yr for deep hydrothermally influenced waters to upwell to the surface around Antarctica. However, estimates of Fe scavenging time scales range from tens to hundreds of years and must be more narrowly constrained to fully resolve the role of hydrothermal Fe in the ocean's biological pump.Plain Language Summary Deep-sea volcanoes (known as hydrothermal vents) release a variety of elements into seawater, including iron. If this iron reaches the ocean surface, it can fuel photosynthesis and carbon drawdown by marine algae, especially in the remote Southern Ocean where algal communities are particularly starved of iron. New work (Jenkins, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL087266) uses helium-3 (also released at hydrothermal vents) as a gauge to estimate that it takes approximately 100 yr for deep waters to emerge at the surface in the Southern Ocean. However, iron is also continually removed from seawater, and the potential for vent-sourced iron to reach the surface rests on whether this loss occurs on time scales longer or shorter than 100 yr, which remains unknown.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,,,0094-8276,1944-8007,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Rochester, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",,,,2020-11-19,WOS:000586497000027,,

In the Southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO) islands, bacterial wilt (BW) caused by the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) is hampering the production of many sustainable and cash crops. To thoroughly analyze the genetic diversity of the RSSC in the SWIO, we performed a wide sampling survey (in Comoros, Mauritius, Reunion, Rodrigues, and Seychelles) that yielded 1,704 isolates from 129 plots, mainly from solanaceous crops. Classification of the isolates to the four major RSSC phylogenetic groups, named phylotypes, showed that 87% were phylotype I, representing the most prevalent strain in each of the SWIO islands. Additionally, 9.7% were phylotype II, and 3.3% were phylotype III; however, these isolates were found only in Reunion. Phylotype IV (2 isolates), known to be restricted to Indonesia-Australia-Japan, was reported in Mauritius, representing the first report of this group in the SWIO. Partial endoglucanase (egl) sequencing, based on the selection of 145 isolates covering the geographic and host diversity in the SWIO (also including strains from Mayotte and Madagascar), revealed 14 sequevars with Reunion and Mauritius displaying the highest sequevar diversity. Through a multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) scheme based on the partial sequencing of 6 housekeeping genes (gdhA, gyrB, rplB, leuS, adk, and mutS) and 1 virulence-associated gene (egl), we inferred the phylogenetic relationships between these 145 SWIO isolates and 90 worldwide RSSC reference strains. Phylotype I was the most recombinogenic, although recombination events were detected among all phylotypes. Amultilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme identified 29 sequence types (STs) with variable geographic distributions in the SWIO. The outstanding epidemiologic feature was STI-13 (sequevar I-31), which was overrepresented in the SWIO and obviously reflected a lineage strongly adapted to the SWIO environment. A goeBURST analysis identified eight clonal complexes (CCs) including SWIO isolates, four CCs being geographically restricted to the SWIO, and four CCs being widespread beyond the SWIO. This work, which highlights notable genetic links between African and SWIO strains, provides a basis for the epidemiological surveillance of RSSC and will contribute to BW management in the SWIO.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,17,0,26,,,1664-462X,,,,,,,,,,,"CIRAD, UMR Peuplements Vegetaux & Bioagresseurs Milieu T, St Pierre, Reunion, FranceAnses, Natl Plant Hlth Lab, Trop Pests & Dis Unit, St Pierre, Reunion, FranceUniv La Reunion, UMR Peuplements Vegetaux & Bioagresseurs Milieu T, St Pierre, Reunion, FranceCtr Natl Rech Appl Dev Rural, Antananarivo, MadagascarInst Natl Rech Agr Peche & Environm, Moroni, ComorosSeychelles Agr Agcy, Victoria, SeychellesFood & Agr Res & Extens Inst, Curepipe, MauritiusUniv Mauritius, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Reduit, MauritiusCommiss Agr, Port Mathurin, MauritiusAssoc Reunionnaise Modernisat Econ Fruitiere Legu, St Pierre, Reunion, FranceINRA, UMR Peuplements Vegetaux & Bioagresseurs Milieu T, St Pierre, Reunion, France",Ctr Natl Rech Appl Dev RuralInst Natl Rech Agr Peche & EnvironmSeychelles Agr AgcyFood & Agr Res & Extens InstCommiss AgrAssoc Reunionnaise Modernisat Econ Fruitiere Legu,,,2017-12-29,WOS:000418250200003,29312394,

The program achieved its primary goals of validating the pre-drill estimates of gas hydrate occurrence and thickness based on 3-D seismic interpretations and wireline log correlations and collecting a comprehensive suite of logging, coring, and pressure testing data. The upper section of the Mount Elbert well was drilled through the base of ice-bearing permafrost to a casing point of 594 m (1950 ft), approximately 15 m (50 ft) above the top of the targeted reservoir interval. The lower portion of the well was continuously cored from 606 m (1987 ft) to 760 m (2494 ft) and drilled to a total depth of 914 m. Ice-bearing permafrost extends to a depth of roughly 536 m and the base of gas hydrate stability is interpreted to extend to a depth of 870 m. Coring through the targeted gas hydrate bearing reservoirs was completed using a wireline-retrievable system. The coring program achieved 85% recovery of 7.6 cm (3 in) diameter core through 154 m (504 ft) of the hole. An onsite team processed the cores, collecting and preserving approximately 250 sub-samples for analyses of pore water geochemistry, microbiology, gas chemistry, petrophysical analysis, and thermal and physical properties. Eleven samples were immediately transferred to either methane-charged pressure vessels or liquid nitrogen for future study of the preserved gas hydrate. Additional offsite sampling, analyses, and detailed description of the cores were also conducted. Based on this work, one lithostratigraphic unit with eight subunits was identified across the cored interval. Subunits II and Va comprise :he majority of the reservoir facies and are dominantly very fine to fine, moderately sorted, quartz, feldspar, and lithic fragment-bearing to -rich sands. Lithostratigraphic and palynologic data indicate that this section is most likely early Eocene to late Paleocene in age. The examined units contain evidence for both marine and non-marine lithofacies, and indications that the depositional environment for the reservoir facies may have been shallower marine than originally interpreted based on pre-drill wireline log interpretations. There is also evidence of reduced salinity marine conditions during deposition that may be related to the paleo-climate and depositional conditions during the early Eocene.

Seawater samples were collected from the Gulf of Mexico during October 2010 and October 2011, three months and fifteen months, respectively, after the oil spill was stopped. Together with previous results from samples collected during the oil spill in May/June 2010, these time series samples allow us to elucidate changes in the optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the time of maximum oil impact to its recovery, 15 months after the spill. Although the oil had profoundly altered the optical properties of the DOM in the entire water column during the oil spill, naturally occurring DOM became predominant in surface waters by October 2010, three months after the spill. Anomalous DOM with high optical yields, however, still resided in deep waters even 15 months after the oil spill in October 2011, showing a persistent influence of the oil in deep waters. Based on fluorescence EEM data and PARAFAC modeling, three oil components and one natural humic-like DOM could be readily identified. The most prominent oil component had its maximum fluorescence intensity at Ex/Em 224/328 nm, and the other two centered on Ex/Em 264/324 and 232/346 nm, respectively. The humic-like DOM component had its wide emission peak from 390 to 460 nm over the excitation wavelength at similar to 248 nm. We hypothesized that component-2 (264/324 nm) was mostly derived from photochemical degradation and the component-3 (232/346 nm) could be a degradation product from both microbial and photochemical degradation, although both C2 and C3 are subject to degradation at different rates.

This paper focuses on development of new energy-saving and economic alkali sources for seawater decalcification by mineral carbonation process, with which not only carbon dioxide could be sequestrated, but also the calcium ions in the seawater could be removed. Magnesium hydroxide was firstly tested as the alkali source in a simple Ca2+,Mg2+/Cl--H2O system, showing the ability of assisting in the decalcification according to the monitor of calcium ions concentration in solution and the analytical results of the sediments using XRD and SEM. This innovative approach permits the use of moderate temperature and pressure conditions in the process of seawater decalcification with mineral carbonation and the production of pure CaCO3 with a potential sale value. Then it is inspired that the brine pretreatment waste of soda ash plant, mainly containing Mg(OH)(2) and CaCO3, may act as the alkali source. Therefore, the seawater decalcification processes using the brine pretreatment waste of soda ash plant as alkali source by CO2 were carried out.

However in such an environment, dust accumulation and bird droppings have been critical issues to the operation of off-grid solar devices. These factors do not only reduce the available power of the modules but also makes the cost of solar devices ineffective since cleaning, especially on well-head towers, is very expensive due to the location.

J,,,,,,,,,Paul Bown,,Planktonic Foraminifera@Nannotax: A web resource for foraminifera taxonomy and biostratigraphy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 31 2016,2016,"Planktonic foraminifera are minute, single-celled, marine microorganisms that float in the upper layers of the open ocean, producing chambered calcareous shells. They are an important part of the modern marine ecosystem and after death their shells sink to become one of the principal components of deep-sea deposits (microfossils). These fossils have a geological record stretching back almost 200 million years and they provide a simple and quick means of age-dating the rocks in which they are found. For this reason they are of great importance to a wide range of earth scientists, including industrial biostratigraphers. Using the small samples that come from subsurface boreholes, biostratigraphers are able to identify the oil and gas reservoir and source rocks of specific ages and can precisely steer while drilling to maximise hydrocarbon production. However, the effective use of foraminifera microfossils for age dating is dependent upon the availability of up-to-date and reliable information concerning their classification (taxonomy - which species is which, and why?), their ecology (which species live where, when and why?) and their geological history (which species lived when and where?). This type of taxonomic skill is in short supply and is difficult to acquire owing to the essential data being locked up in academic texts of limited availability - especially outside research institutions. Increasingly, end-users expect to be able to find such data via the internet but they are poorly served by current systems. In order to widen access to this crucial information we will develop a web resource called Planktonic Foraminfera@Nannotax or PF@N that we hope will become the online reference source for anyone needing to obtain basic to specialist information on planktonic foraminifera. The project will build on an online resource called Nannotax that we previously developed for another microfossil group, calcareous nannofossils, using NERC knowledge exchange funding. This resource has proved highly successful as shown by usage statistics and personal feedback. The foraminifera information will come from a combination of newly compiled data for the last 30 million years (Oligocene to Present) and a previous Cretaceous to Eocene compilation from an older and now out-of-date database called Chronos. The availability of this Chronos content will considerably aid the development of the database content. When completed, PF@N will provide a comprehensive listing of living and fossil planktonic foraminifera taxa ranging over 120 million years of evolutionary history. Each species will have a short description, age data, multiple illustrations, bibliographic references and original descriptions. There will be identification keys and linked pages providing information on study methods. Our Principal Investigators and Project Partners will ensure that expert information, much of it derived from NERC-funded UK research, will be incorporated into the resource and our industrial partners will 'test-drive' the system and provide feedback and applied expertise. We think that the development of this system is essential to the effective use of foraminifera in the hydrocarbon industry, but also to their application more broadly, for example, as used by palaeoceanographers, geochemists, palaeobiologists, plankton biologists and oceanographers. By removing the barriers to learning foraminifera taxonomy, identifying specimens and obtaining accurate information about species, we think that existing users will be able to expand their expertise and that this will also open the way to a range of new users.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/N017900/1,,,,,,,,University College London,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15352576,,

In order to examine the diagenetic history from the perspective of geochemical elements, the concentrations of minor element (Sr, Na, Mg), trace elements (Ba, Fe, Mn, Al, Si), and rare-earth elements (REE) and yttrium (Y) were determined for 105 corals and 84 matrices collected from the Rogers Wreck Point (RWP), Western Onshore area (WO), and offshore George Town (GT) areas. With the transformation of aragonite to calcite, the Sr, Na, and Ba values decreased, but Mg increased, which are indicative of diagenetic alteration in an open water system. Due to intrinsic vital effects and the extrinsic diagenetic environment, the variations of Sr, Na, Ba, and Mg concentrations between Acropora and Montastrea from the GT area are different to those of their counterparts from RWP and WO. The signatures of Sr, Na, Ba, and Mg are in good agreement with the diagenetic history as determined from petrographic and stable isotopic criteria.The REE + Y (REY) concentrations (Sigma REY) are higher in the matrices (0.2-6.9 ppm, average 2.6 ppm) than in the associated corals (0.1-5.4 ppm, average 0.6 ppm). Shale-normalized REY patterns of the Pleistocene Ironshore Formation are similar to those of oxygenated seawater, which are characterized by (1) light REE depletion relative to heavy REE (average Dy-SN/Sm-SN = 1.7, n = 35), (2) positive La anomalies (average Pr/Pr* = 1.17, n = 53), and (3) negative Ce anomalies (average Ce/Ce* = 0.49, n = 53). The preserved seawater-like REY distribution pattern, the lack of correlation between Sigma REY and mineralogy, and the lack of correlation between Sigma REY and diagenesis-sensitive stable oxygen isotope (delta O-18) indicate that meteoric diagenesis did not have a major impact on the REY distribution patterns. The matrices and corals in the GT area, compared to their counterparts from RWP and WO, have relatively less depleted LREE and lower Y in REY distribution pattern, suggesting contamination by minor amounts of detrital sediments. This is supported by the fact that limestones from the GT area contain abnormally high contents of detrital elements (Al, Si). The variations in Sigma REY in carbonate rocks from locality to locality probably reflect variations that existed in the local depositional environments where these deposits originally formed.

Intertidal communities are particularly sensitive since most organisms from these ecosystems are sessile or present reduced mobility. Hence, it is important to validate the use of resident species as sentinels to characterize the impact of oil spills on the rocky shores and the improvement during the restoration process. Recently the advantages of using the shanny Lipophrys pholis in pollution monitoring within the northwestern Atlantic coast has been pointed out. Therefore, with the aim of further validating the use of L. pholis in pollution monitoring associated with petrogenic hydrocarbon contamination, a multi-biomarker approach study was carried out 1 week after a moderate oil spill from the waste treatment plant (WTP) of the major Portuguese refinery in the north of Portugal (Petrogal). Fish collected at 2 km from the accident displayed a significant induction of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity (EROD) and fluorescent aromatic compounds (FACs) in bile (up to a 5-fold induction) in comparison with the pre-spill scenario, and a 15% induction in erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA), a biomarker of genotoxicity. In contrast, no significant differences were recorded in the reference site. In order to better characterize the time-course accumulation of FACs in bile after a PAH insult, laboratory exposure of L pholis to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) was performed. A clear dose response accumulation of B[a]P metabolites was observed that closely reflected nominal exposure concentrations already after 3 d. Overall, the findings of the present study highlight the potential of L. pholis in pollution monitoring dealing not only with chronic contamination, but also with oil spill accidents of a moderate scale. Taking into consideration that EROD and FACs determinations in L pholis are cost effective, rapid and easy to use, they offer a great potential to be incorporated into risk assessment of PAHs in the scope of national monitoring programs and the European Water Policy legislation.

Tissue concentrations and accumulation rates of especially organic contaminants (PAHs, PCBs and organotins) were clearly elevated at the innermost coastal stations near the harbor area. Biological effects of contaminant exposure on caged mussels were evaluated by measuring a suite of biomarkers including catalase, glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, lipid peroxidation, acetylcholinesterase activity and lysosomal membrane stability. Mussels transplanted near the harbor area were able to elevate their antioxidant defense in response to environmental contamination. Reduced morphometric condition index and soft tissue growth rate together with increased lipid peroxidation and low lysosomal membrane stability were also observed at the most contaminated site.

Knowledge of carbon storage in tropical forests is improving, but regional variations are still poorly understood, and this constrains forest management and conservation efforts associated with carbon valuation mechanisms (e.g., carbon markets). This deficiency is especially pronounced in tropical islands and low-lying coastal areas where climate change impacts are expected to be among the most severe. This study presents the first field estimate of island-wide carbon storage in ecosystems of Oceania, with special attention to the regional role of coastal mangroves, which occur on islands and coastal zones throughout the tropics. On two island groups of Micronesia (Yap and Palau), we sampled all above- and belowground C pools, including soil and vegetation, in 24 sites distributed evenly among the three major vegetation structural types: mangroves, upland forests, and open savannas (generally on degraded lands formerly forested). Total C stocks were estimated to be 3.9 and 15.2 Tg C on Yap and Palau, respectively. Mangroves contained by far the largest per-hectare C pools (830-1218 Mg C ha(-1)), with deep organic-rich soils alone storing more C (631-754 Mg C ha(-1)) than all pools combined in upland systems. Despite covering just 12-13% of land area, mangroves accounted for 24-34% of total island C stocks. Savannas (156-203 Mg C ha(-1)) contained significantly lower C stocks than upland forests (375-437 Mg C ha(-1)), suggesting that reforesting savannas where appropriate has high potential for carbon-based funding to aid restoration objectives. For mangroves, these results demonstrate the key role of these systems within the broader context of C storage in island and coastal landscapes. Sustainable management of mangrove forests and their large C stocks is of high importance at the regional scale, and climate change mitigation programs such as REDD+ could play a large role in avoiding deforestation of mangroves where this is a management objective.

In this study, we successfully identify the host litho-units of gas hydrate and show its effects in the identification of lithology using neural network techniques, which is not reported earlier. We use well log data acquired at three holes (10A, 03A and 04A) in 2006 during the first expedition of the Indian National Gas IIydrate Program (NGIIP-01). Five different logging while drilling data (e.g. density, neutron porosity, gamma ray, resistivity and sonic) are considered for the mapping of lithology and gas hydrate. In the presence of gas hydrate, the resistivity and sonic velocity of the host sediments increase significantly, whereas density, neutron porosity and gamma ray arc negligibly affected. Therefore, we calculate resistivity and sonic velocity for water-saturated sediment (without gas hydrate) theoretically to remove the effects of gas hydrate. At first, we apply the seven unsupervised classification methods (i.e. elbow, dendrogram, K-means, 3-D clustering, principal component analysis, Devies-Bouldin index and self-organizing map) to the data with gas hydrate (e.g. observed) and without gas hydrate (i.e. water-saturated/theoretical) to assess the data dimensionality and the number of clusters/litho-units. Each of the unsupervised schemes has its own pros and cons, and may provide different number of cluster/litho-units; sometimes, it is difficult to interpret from only one method. However, all seven methods provide same number of clusters in our study. Then, we apply the supervised classification method (i.e. Bayesian neural networks optimized by hybrid Monte Carlo searching technique) to the training data to refine the defined litho-units and map them with depth. Our approach identifies four types of litho-units and illustrates that the lithology in this area is dominated by clay (similar to 64 per cent) with some amount of silty clay, silt and minor sand. Gas hydrate is found in clay, silty clay and silt and not in sand. Results also show that, if gas hydrate is not considered as a separate unit, it is distributed as lithology in its hosts (i.e. clay, silty clay and silt). The method is very stable up to similar to 15 per cent of random noise added to the data and results are well matched with the analysis of recovered core data. Identified lithologies at three wells correlate very well with seismic section crossing the wells. Very low permeability (<0.1 mD) estimated at three wells also indicates the clay-dominated lithology in our study area.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,0,15,,,0956-540X,1365-246X,,,,,,,,,,"CSIR, Natl Geophys Res Inst, Hyderabad 500007, Telangana, IndiaWadia Inst Himalayan Geol, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India",,,,2020-04-27,WOS:000525944600026,,

This study investigates the horizontal performance of acoustic communication to better determine its suitability for relaying data directly to land based stations. Modelling of both deep and shallow underwater acoustic propagation was performed using the ray tracing model, Bellhop. This determined that the position of the modems is important to ensure optimum signal to noise ratio due to the refraction throughout the medium. In shallow water, multipath effects including selective fading and inter-symbol interference become the dominant source of problems.Data obtained from trials off the south coast of France is studied to investigate the various mechanisms affecting the performance of the AQUAmodem from Aquatec Group Limited. The environment included a descending bathymetry from 350m to 1000m over a range of approximately 6km. Based on FSK techniques, the modems were found to work effectively despite being located in unfavourable positions for efficient transmission. Communication over the entire trial range was attained, although it was expected further could have been achieved if not for time constraints. Additionally, data obtained using the same modelling methods applied to the trial environment show a close relationship with the data recorded by the modems.The results from this study indicate several areas of interest for further experimentation that can be better suited to assess performance parameters of underwater acoustic modems.

However, uncertainties remain regarding any environmental impacts of these devices, especially their potential interaction with marine species. In fact, little is known about interactions of MRE devices with the environment and this is mainly due to the difficulties associated with the monitoring at high energy marine deployment sites. Industry, governmental bodies and research institutes need to work closely together in order to alleviate environmental uncertainties, de-risk the marine renewable energy sector, facilitate consenting and reduce the cost of delivering MRE. The industrial partner Tidal Energy Limited (TEL) will deploy its DeltaStream tidal turbine in Ramsey Sound, Pembrokeshire in April 2014 for a period of 12 months. The DeltaStream turbine will operate without shut down mitigation, constituting one of the first commercial deployment in such manner. Nevertheless, the licensing requirements include the close monitoring of range behaviour and empirical encounter rates [1]. TEL is currently in the process of designing the installation and commissioning plans in order to meet their environmental monitoring requirements. The business partner requested the need of environmental R&D support from Swansea University regarding their Environmental Monitoring Plan (EMP). The intern will support TEL in the installation, commissioning and testing of the real-time marine mammals monitoring instrumentation which are undertaken using active and passive acoustics (radar, hydrophones, hardware and software) and will participate in the development, validation and refinement of these monitoring techniques. This joint knowledge transfer activity between Swansea University and TEL will offer an insight of the current specific MRE industry research needs and will result in a more focused academic research support to the sector. Merin Broudic's work considers the environmental impact of marine energy devices, in particular underwater acoustics. He has 4 years experience in projects to record, process, analyse and characterise underwater noise in high tidal flow environments. He has experience of working with marine mammal observers and boat based surveys. He has worked closely with the industrial partner TEL since 2010, delivering underwater acoustic expertise. Merin has a good knowledge of the Pamuard software which will be used to process the raw data collected during marine mammals detection activities in the DeltaStream project.[1] Sparling, C.

Two large block sugarcanetrials were started at the beginning of the 2014/15 season, in plant and ratoon crops, being commercially grown in far north Queensland, Australia. Both trials consist of two adjacent, irrigated cane blocks (3.57.5 ha) with similar soils and identical agronomic inputs. In each trial, both blocks are irrigated/fertigated by sub-surface drip irrigation (SSDI) - one receiving ongoing, monthly injections of SEASOL (R) at 10 L ha(-1) and the other serving as an untreated control. Crop yield assessments were conducted at each site, by comparing harvested mill tonnages and CCS (commercial cane sugar) values from whole treatment block areas. Results data have been statistically analysed by 1-way ANOVA and means separated to P= 0.05. It is intended the trials should continue, until replanting of the trial crops is deemed to be necessary, according to commercial standards. Results summary: SEASOL (R) treated blocks yielded between 9.5-36% more tonnes of raw cane ha(-1) and between 11.1-37% more tonnes of raw sugar ha(-1), compared to the untreated controls. There were no treatment differences in CCS values. These results support the use of the liquid seaweed extract biostimulant (SEASOL (R)), as a regular management input, for improving tropical sugarcane production and farm profitability. There is also the potential (pending further research) to show whether lower rates of fertilisers can be used to produce satisfactorily yielding crops.",,,,,International Symposia on Tropical and Temperate Horticulture (ISTTH)International Symposia on Tropical and Temperate Horticulture (ISTTH),"NOV 20-25, 2016NOV 20-25, 2016",Int Soc Horticultural SciInt Soc Horticultural Sci,"Cairns, AUSTRALIACairns, AUSTRALIA",3,0,0,0,1,0,3,,,0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62612-00-6,,,,,,,,,"Farmsnorth Res, Innisfail, Qld, AustraliaSeasol Int, Bayswater, Vic, Australia",Farmsnorth ResSeasol Int,,,2019-06-04,WOS:000467945500098,,

An extensive monitoring program is being considered in order to ensure the Carbon Capture and Geological Storage (CCGS) projects efficiency. However, there are several challenges to be confronted concerning the CO2 monitoring in such adverse conditions as the Pre-salt reservoirs. Among the existing techniques for monitoring offshore storage sites, some of them have already technological maturity and applicability to the Pre-salt environment but other methods must rely on some development or methodology adaptation to the specific features of these fields and they will be initiatives of the PRO-CO2 technological program of PETROBRAS Research Center.

A case study was performed using a 50K bulk carrier engaged in domestic services in South Korea. Considering the energy exporting market for South Korea, the fuel supply chain was designed with the two largest suppliers: Middle East (LNG-Qatar/MGO-Saudi Arabia) and U.S. The life cycle of each fuel type was categorized into three stages: Well-to-Tank (WtT), Tank-to-Wake (TtW), and Well-to-Wake (WtW). With the process modelling, the environmental impact of each stage was analyzed based on the five environmental impact categorizes: Global Warming Potential (GWP), Acidification Potential (AP), Photochemical Potential (POCP), Eutrophication Potential (EP) and Particulate Matter (PM). Analysis results reveal that emission levels for the LNG cases are significantly lower than the MGO cases in all potential impact categories. Particularly, Case 1 (LNG import to Korea from Qatar) is identified as the best option as producing the lowest emission levels per 1.0 x 10(7) MJ of fuel consumption: 977 tonnages of CO2 equivalent (for GWP), 1.76 tonnages of SO2 equivalent (for AP), 1.18 tonnages of N equivalent (for EP), 4.28 tonnages of NMVOC equivalent (for POCP) and 26 kg of PM 2.5 equivalent (for PM). On the other hand, the results also point out that the selection of the fuel supply routes could be an important factor contributing to emission levels since longer distances for freight transportation result in more emissions. It is worth noting that the life cycle assessment can offer us better understanding of holistic emission levels contributed by marine fuels from the cradle to the grave, which are highly believed to remedy the shortcomings of current marine emission indicators.",,,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,2,0,36,,,,2077-1312,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn, Glasgow G4 0LZ, Lanark, ScotlandPusan Natl Univ, Dept Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Busan 46241, South KoreaKorea Ctr Int Maritime Safety Cooperat, Maritime Res Inst, Sejong 30103, South KoreaHarbin Inst Technol, Fac Marine Sci & Technol, Weihai 264209, Peoples R China",Korea Ctr Int Maritime Safety Cooperat,,,2019-12-09,WOS:000498398700033,,

An interdisciplinary approach of various fields such as microbiology, molecular biology, chemistry, genetics, chemical engineering and agriculture in addition to cross-sectional technologies such as economy, logistics and digitalization is necessary to meet the future global challenges. The genomic era has contributed significantly to the exploitation of nature's biodiversity also from extreme habitats. By applying modern technologies it is now feasible to deliver robust enzymes (extremozymes) and robust microbial systems that are active at temperatures up to 120 degrees C, at pH 0 and 12 and at 1000 bar. In the postgenomic era, different sophisticated omits analyses will allow the identification of countless novel enzymes regardless of the lack of cultivability of most microorganisms. Furthermore, elaborate protein engineering methods are clearing the way towards tailor-made robust biocatalysts. Applying environmentally friendly and efficient biological processes, terrestrial and marine biomass can be converted to high value products e.g. chemicals, building blocks, biomaterials, pharmaceuticals, food, feed and biofuels. Thus, further application of extremophiles has the potential to improve sustainability of existing biotechnological processes towards a greener biobased industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The model structure is based on the steps provided in the Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and adapted into a Bayesian Network model.

While land change impacts on ecosystem carbon dynamics have been the focus of numerous studies, few efforts have been based on observational data incorporating multiple ecosystem types spanning large geographic areas over long time horizons. In this study we use a variety of synoptic-scale remote sensing data to estimate the effect of LULC changes associated with urbanization, agricultural expansion and contraction, forest harvest, and wildfire on the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems (forest, grasslands, shrublands, and agriculture) in the conterminous United States (i.e. excluding Alaska and Hawaii) between 1973 and 2010. We estimate large net declines in the area of agriculture and forest, along with relatively small increases in grasslands and shrublands. The largest net change in any class was an estimated gain of 114 865 km(2) of developed lands, an average rate of 3282 km(2) yr(-1). On average, US ecosystems sequestered carbon at an annual rate of 254 Tg C yr(-1). In forest lands, the net sink declined by 35% over the study period, largely a result of land-use legacy, increasing disturbances, and reductions in forest area due to land use conversion. Uncertainty in LULC change data contributed to a similar to 16% margin of error in the annual carbon sink estimate prior to 1985 (approximately +/- 40 Tg C yr(-1)). Improvements in LULC and disturbance mapping starting in the mid-1980s reduced this uncertainty by similar to 50% after 1985. We conclude that changes in LULC are a critical component to understanding ecosystem carbon dynamics, and continued improvements in detection, quantification, and attribution of change have the potential to significantly reduce current uncertainties.",,,,,,,,,53,1,0,0,26,0,59,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Tacoma, WA 98402 USAUS Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USAApex Resource Management Solut Ltd, Ottawa, ON, CanadaUniv Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON, CanadaUS Geol Survey, Box 25046, Denver, CO 80225 USAUS Geol Survey, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 22092 USAUS Geol Survey, Sioux Falls, SD USA",Apex Resource Management Solut Ltd,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000428799600001,,

The systems monitor energy consumption using ambient intelligence (AmI) and knowledge management (KM) technologies. Together they create a decision support system as an innovative add-on to currently used energy management systems.Design/methodology/approach - Energy consumption data (ECD) are processed within a service-oriented architecture-based platform. The platform provides condition-based energy consumption warning, online diagnostics of energy-related problems, support to manufacturing process lines installation and ramp-up phase and continuous improvement/optimisation of energy efficiency. The systems monitor energy consumption using AmI and KM technologies. Together they create a decision support system as an innovative add-on to currently used energy management systems.Findings - The systems produce an improvement in energy efficiency in manufacturing small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The systems provide more comprehensive information about energy use and some knowledge-based support.Research limitations/implications - Prototype systems were trialled in a manufacturing company that produces mooring chains for the offshore oil and gas industry, an energy intensive manufacturing operation. The paper describes a case study involving energy-intensive processes that addressed different manufacturing concepts and involved the manufacture of mooring chains for offshore platforms. The system was developed to support online detection of energy efficiency problems.Practical implications - Energy efficiency can be optimised in assembly and manufacturing processes. The systems produce an improvement in energy efficiency in manufacturing SMEs. The systems provide more comprehensive information about energy use and some knowledge-based support.Social implications - This research addresses two of the most critical problems in energy management in industrial production technologies: how to efficiently and promptly acquire and provide information online for optimising energy consumption and how to effectively use such knowledge to support decision making.Originality/value - This research was inspired by the need for industry to have effective tools for energy efficiency, and that opportunities for industry to take up energy efficiency measures are mostly not carried out.

Here we present a modelling approach to predict the potential for compressed-air energy storage in porous rocks. By combining this with an extensive geological database, we provide a regional assessment of this potential for the United Kingdom. We find the potential storage capacity is equivalent to approximately 160% of the United Kingdom's electricity consumption for January and February 2017 (77-96 TWh), with a roundtrip energy efficiency of 54-59%.

A novel mobile floating desalination plant is proposed for Ras Ghareb city in Egypt. The compatibility between floater natural periods and the energy excitation range of waves in deployment area can lead to resonance responses. Therefore, understanding the motions behaviour among waves of such floaters at a particular location is important for its safety, performance and operation. The goal of the present study is to investigate the suitability of proposed concept for Egyptian environment conditions by characterising the behaviour of the plant motion responses during its entire deployment conditions. Based on full scale design of the proposed plant, experimental study over a range of wave heights and frequencies was performed in the present study using a 1:100 scale model test. In order to identify the plant natural frequency and damping ratio, free decay and swinging tests were performed for different load conditions. Different wave heights were tested during the experiments in order to investigate the effect of wave height on the heave and pitch responses at plant natural frequencies. The experimental test results were compared with numerical results from frequency domain program HydroD implemented in Sesam DNV GL software package. Results show that heave and pitch motion responses give the closest agreement between the measurements and numerical predictions over the whole range of wave periods except the peak spike. The proposed cylindrical FDP is compared against a conventional ship FPSO concept widely used for offshore freshwater production and it was concluded that new cylindrical FDP shows better motion responses compared to conventional ship FPSO concept in same wave bands in Egypt.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,0,13,,,0029-8018,1873-5258,,,,,,,,,,"Port Said Univ, Dept Naval Architecture & Marine Engn, Port Fouad City, EgyptUniv Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",,,,2020-08-06,WOS:000551161000024,,

Oxidative stress responses including hepatic cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) and serum antioxidant capacity were evaluated in fish exposed to PAHs. Fish were exposed to water-accommodated fractions (WAFs) of crude oil (7.0 +/- 0.10mg/L C6-C28) after which solutions were diluted below the level of detection over 8h using 15 ppt aerated artificial seawater. Before euthanasia, fish remained in aquaria for 12h, 24h, or 48h. Three replicate experiments were conducted at each time point using unexposed fish as experimental controls. Significant differences (p<0.05) in CYP1A induction were observed in exposed versus control fish at 24h. Expression of CYP1A increased by 25%, 66%, and 23% in exposed fish at 12h, 24h, and 48h, respectively. Significant increases were observed in antioxidant capacity of nonenzymatic antioxidants in exposed versus control fish at each time point. Given the activity of CYP1A, radicals formed during PAH detoxification likely resulted in increased oxidant load requiring elevated antioxidant defenses. Research is needed to determine the duration of oxidative stress responses considering the potential for lipid oxidation in exposed fish or species feeding on exposed fish.

It examines the potential for the planting of 15 selected tree species for carbon storage under various water-energy regimes to create carbon neutral (or negative) villa neighborhoods. Recent improvements to solar photovoltaic and reverse-osmosis desalination technology have lowered the carbon emissions for water production by over 99% relative to current gas-powered multi-stage flash desalination (0.08 kg CO2/m(3) vs.12.8 kg CO2/m(3)). This allows trees planted in hot, desert climates to utilize treated ocean water while net sequestering between 1.7 and 38.2 kg C/tree/yr depending on species. When planted in existing neighborhood open spaces, we find that net carbon storage rates from trees are significant (15-800%) relative to operational emissions rates for building energy (cooling, lighting, equipment) when households are supplied from 100% renewable energy sources. Thus, as technology advances, landscape design strategies in the region could evolve to maximize planting to sequester carbon while also creating more comfortable outdoor spaces that enhance the livability of neighborhoods. This study provides a first step in identifying the potential for landscape architectural design to employ a tree-based, neighborhood scale, carbon storage strategy in arid regions such as those in the Arabian Peninsula. As nations move towards a carbon-neutral future, it is imperative to develop innovative solutions that address urban sustainability, especially in resource-challenged and extreme climate regions where new urban development is planned.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,4,0,13,,,0169-2046,1872-6062,,,,,,,,,,"MIT, Norman B Leventhal Ctr Adv Urbanism, E14-140,75 Amherst St, Cambridge, MA 02139 USAMIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,,2019-09-30,WOS:000484871000012,,

Appropriate species compositions and spacing regimes are critical to achieve ecosystem benefits and improve yields of all the component crops. Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) is an important cash crop globally but it requires shade for survival and growth. However, the effects of shade-tree species composition and spacing regime on nutrient cycling in cocoa plantations are not well understood. This study investigated the effects of shade tree species and spacing regimes on soil and plant nutrient availability at 8 years after plantation establishment in Papua New Guinea. Three cocoa intercropping systems were established in which T. cacao was planted with either a non-legume timber tree, Canarium indicum, or a legume non-timber tree, Gliricidia sepium. The shade-tree spacing regimes included either 8 m x 16 m or 8 m x 8 m in the Theobroma + Canarium plantations. There was an ongoing thinning regime in the Theobroma + Gliricidia plantation, with a final shade-tree spacing of 12 m x 12 m. Soil total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) were significantly higher in the Theobroma + Gliricidia plantation with 12 m x 12 m spacing and the Theobroma + Canarium plantation with 8 m x 16 m spacing than in the Theobroma + Canarium plantation with 8 m x 8 m spacing. Foliar TN and P were correlated with soil TN and P, respectively, whereas no correlation was detected between soil and leaf K concentrations. Foliar TN, P and K were under ideal concentrations for T. cacao in all of the plantations. The Theobroma + Gliricidia plantation had higher soil water extractable phosphorus (P) than the two Theobroma + Canarium plantations, probably due to frequent pruning of the G. sepium trees. Foliar C isotope composition (delta C-13) of T. cacao suggested that T. cacao close to G. sepium or close to C. indicum with spacing of 8 m x 16 m and 8 m x 8 m had similar light interception. However, increased C. indicum spacing increased the light interception of T. cacao trees that were not planted next to C. indicum. This study indicated that non-legume timber trees with an optimized spacing regime can be used as overstorey shade trees for T. cacao.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is developing a laboratory testing protocol to evaluate the effectiveness of SWAs in removing crude oil from a solid substrate. This paper summarizes some of the defining research supporting this new protocol. Multiple variables were tested to determine their effect on SWA performance. The protocol was most sensitive to SWA-to-oil ratio and rotational speed of mixing. Less sensitive variables were contact time, mixing time, and SWA concentration when total applied mass of active product was constant. EPA recommendations for the testing protocol will be made following round robin testing.

The paper is particularly concerned with how environmental awareness can function as a specific CSR activity, and how environmental awareness can impact corporate brand. The paper also investigates the role of personal leadership, both within the company and externally, in developing an environmentally responsible company.Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses an explorative research method and studies one company within the Norwegian offshore oil and gas industry. The analysis is based on qualitative interview data.Findings - The study shows how the founder's role as cultural architect has a positive impact on how external constituents assess the image of the company, especially with regard to the company's innovations and its awareness of environmental issues, in two ways: first, it shapes, coordinates, energizes and leverages employees' attitudes and behaviors in relation to environmental issues; second, it thereby enforces a positive external reputation for the company, especially as a green innovator.Research limitations/implications - The findings are induced from a case study of one company in a particular industry. The results may therefore not be applicable or generalizable to other companies or other industries.Practical implications - The study suggests that companies may gain reputational advantages and differentiation in integrating corporate social responsibility and environmental awareness as a core element of their business strategy.Originality/value - The paper contributes to the corporate branding literature by exploring the role of CSR, and in particular concern for environmental issues and personal leadership, in building corporate reputation and developing a strong corporate brand.",,,,,,,,,69,0,0,0,2,0,78,,,1061-0421,2054-1643,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Strategy & Management, Bergen, NorwayStord Haugesund Univ Coll, Dept Tech Econ & Maritime Studies, Haugesund, Norway",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000211795500008,,

The largest simulated variations in carbon fluxes occurred in the Midwest, where large fire events (1937, 1988) decreased vegetation biomass and soil carbon pools. The Southeast showed decadal-type trends and alternated between a carbon source (1920s, 1940s, 1970s) and a sink (1910s, 1930s, 1950s) in response to climate variations. The drought of the 1930s was most obvious in the creation of a large carbon source in the Midwest and the Great Plains, depleting soil carbon reserves. The Northeast shows the smallest amplitudes in the variation of its carbon stocks. Western regions release large annual carbon fluxes from their naturally fire-prone grassland- and shrubland-dominated areas, which respond quickly to chronic fire disturbance, thus reducing temporal variations in carbon stocks. However, their carbon dynamics reflect the impacts of prolonged drought periods as well as regional increases in rainfall from ocean-atmosphere climate regime shifts, most evident in the 1970s. Projections into the future by using the warm CGCM1 climate scenario show the Northeast becoming mostly a carbon source, the Southeast becoming the largest carbon source in the 21st century, and the two western-most regions becoming carbon sinks in the second half of the 21st century.

The resilience of the forest to the combined pressures of deforestation and global warming is therefore of great concern(2), especially as some general circulation models ( GCMs) predict a severe drying of Amazonia in the twenty- first century(3-5). Here we analyse these climate projections with reference to the 2005 drought in western Amazonia, which was associated(6) with unusually warm North Atlantic sea surface temperatures ( SSTs). We show that reduction of dry-season ( July - October) rainfall in western Amazonia correlates well with an index of the north - south SST gradient across the equatorial Atlantic ( the 'Atlantic N - S gradient'). Our climate model is unusual among current GCMs in that it is able to reproduce this relationship and also the observed twentieth- century multidecadal variability in the Atlantic N - S gradient(7), provided that the effects of aerosols are included in the model(8).

Porosity in caprocks evaluated for sealing capacity before injection can be altered by geochemical reactions induced by dissolution of injected CO2 into pore fluids, impacting long-term sealing capacity. Therefore, long-term performance of CO2 sequestration sites may be dependent on both initial distribution and connectivity of pores in caprocks, and on changes induced by geochemical reaction after injection of CO2, which are currently poorly understood. This article presents results from an experimental study of changes to caprock porosity and pore network geometry in two caprock formations under conditions relevant to CO2 sequestration. Pore connectivity and total porosity increased in the Gothic Shale; while total porosity increased but pore connectivity decreased in the Marine Tuscaloosa. Gothic Shale is a carbonate mudstone that contains volumetrically more carbonate minerals than Marine Tuscaloosa. Carbonate minerals dissolved to a greater extent than silicate minerals in Gothic Shale under high CO2 conditions, leading to increased porosity at length scales approximate to 1m. Mineral reactions also contributed to a decrease in pore connectivity, possibly as a result of precipitation in pore throats or hydration of the high percentage of clays. This study highlights the role that mineralogy of the caprock can play in geochemical response to CO2 injection and resulting changes in sealing capacity in long-term CO2 storage projects.",,,,,,,,,50,0,0,0,4,0,59,,,1092-8758,1557-9018,,,,,,,,,,"Colorado Sch Mines, Hydrol Sci & Engn Program, Golden, CO 80401 USAOak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Chem Sci, Oak Ridge, TN USAUniv Wyoming, Dept Geol & Geophys, Laramie, WY 82071 USAUniv Wyoming, Sch Energy Resources, Laramie, WY 82071 USASandia Natl Labs, Sandia, NM USAUniv Wyoming, Dept Chem Engn, Laramie, WY 82071 USAColorado Sch Mines, Civil & Environm Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USAUniv Texas El Paso, Dept Phys, El Paso, TX 79968 USAChina Univ Petr, Dept Petr Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China",,,,2016-12-07,WOS:000386857200002,,

We used a model (MEL-GEM, Marine Biological Laboratory General Ecosystem Model) of ecosystem C and nitrogen (N) dynamics to predict and analyze historical (1829-1990) changes in C storage in a N-limited, tussock-tundra ecosystem near Toolik Lake on the North Slope of Alaska. The model simulates stand-level photosynthesis and N uptake by plants, allocation of C and N to foliage, stems, and fine roots, respiration in these tissues, turnover of biomass through litterfall, and decomposition of litter and soil organic matter. We first calibrated the model by deriving a single parameter set that closely simulated the response of tussock tundra to decade-long experimental manipulations of nutrients, temperature, light, and atmospheric CO2.The calibrated model predicts that historical increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 have increased total ecosystem C storage. Higher temperatures increased soil and plant respiration, but those losses of C were overcompensated by increased photosynthesis resulting from redistribution of N from soil to plants. This redistribution of N was due to increased net mineralization and uptake of N. Increases in atmospheric CO, also increased photosynthesis, but consequent increases in C storage were constrained by limits on increases in the C:N ratio of vegetation. In contrast, hypothesized historical decreases in soil moisture substantially decreased simulated total ecosystem C storage as a result of large increases in soil respiration. With decreased soil moisture, increases in photosynthesis associated with redistribution of N from soil to plants only partially compensated for respiratory C losses, as plant uptake of N could not keep pace with increased N mineralization rates. Consequent losses of N from the ecosystem contributed to the declines in C storage under drier conditions.Based on the combined effects of reconstructed historical changes in atmospheric CO2, mean growing-season temperature, and two alternative soil moisture scenarios, the model predicts a -5.4 to +2.3% change in ecosystem C from 1829 to 1990. These estimates are consistent with field evidence that historically recent changes in C storage of tussock tundra have been relatively small. However, the model also predicts that relatively large transient losses of ecosystem C (50-180 g.m(-2).yr(-1)) may frequently have occurred since the late 1800s, with one of the largest simulated C losses of the 20th century occurring from 1988 to 1990 (3-yr average = 133 g C.m(-2).yr(-1)). These simulated losses were similar to losses measured in tussock tundra at Toolik Lake from 1983 to 1990 (e.g., 1990 losses = 156 g Cm-2.yr(-1)) but nonetheless suggest that these measured losses may be transitory in nature.",,,,,,,,,62,2,0,0,19,0,68,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,,,,,,,"MARINE BIOL LAB, CTR ECOSYST, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USAUNIV CALIF BERKELEY, DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL, BERKELEY, CA 94720 USA",,,,1997-06-01,WOS:A1997XB14400019,,

As potential pathways toward a net-zero-power system, this work analyzes future power systems based on intermittent renewable electricity with long-term storage through chemical energy carriers, so called Power-to-Fuel-to-Power systems, and a system based on the combustion of natural gas with 100% carbon capture and storage. The chemical energy carriers selected for electricity storage are hydrogen, methane and ammonia. Using life cycle assessment, we determine and compare the environmental impacts of 1 kWh of dispatchable electricity produced by the two pathways on seven impact categories. There was not one single pathway that had the most environmental benefits on all seven impact categories. Of the Power-to-Fuel-to-Power systems assessed the use of hydrogen for storage has the lowest environmental impact in all categories. Additionally, all the Power-to-Fuel-to-Power systems have a lower environmental impact on climate change, photochemical ozone formation and fossil resource depletion compared with the natural gas with carbon capture and storage system. The natural gas with carbon capture and storage system has a lower environmental impact on particulate matter formation, marine eutrophication and mineral resource scarcity. Our work is complemented by an analysis of pathways from a net-zero-direct-CO2 to a life-cycle net-zero-CO2-equivalent power system which is actually climate neutral, achieved by direct air capture of the residual CO2 from the atmosphere. However, this leads to an increase in all other impact categories of 11% for the Power-to-Fuel-to-Power systems and 21% in the natural gas combustion with carbon capture and storage system. A system sizing study also highlights the very low capacity factors of the capital employed for electricity storage, raising the point of economic feasibility.

Unfortunately, large-scale, high-spatial-resolution observations of plant assemblages associated with these regions are generally unavailable, so accurate modeling of plant assemblages and biome boundaries is often needed. We built different discriminant analysis models and used them to convert various combinations of spatial climatic data (surface temperature and precipitation) and spatial environmental data (topography, soil, permafrost) into a biome-level map of Alaska. Five biomes (alpine tundra and ice fields, Arctic tundra, shrublands, boreal forest, and coastal rainforest) and one biome transition zone are modeled. Mean annual values of climatic variables were less useful than their annual extrema in this context. A quadratic discriminant analysis, combined with climate, topography, permafrost, and soil information, produced the most accurate Alaskan biome classification (skill = 74% when compared to independent data). The multivariate alteration detection transformation was used to identify Climatic Transition Zones (CTZs) with large interannual variability, and hence, less climatic consistency than other parts of Alaska. Biome classification was the least accurate in the CTZs, leading to the conclusion that large interannual climatic variability does not favor a unique biome. We interpret the CTZs as transition biome areas or ecotones between the five core biomes cited above. Both disturbance events (e.g., fires and subsequent plant succession sequences) and the partial intersection of the environmental variables used to characterize Alaskan biomes further complicate biome classification. Alaskan results obtained from the data-driven quadratic discriminant model compare favorably (based on Kappa statistics) with those produced by an equilibrium-based biome model for regions of Canada ecologically similar to the biomes we studied in Alaska. Climatic statistics are provided for each biome studied.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,0,11,,,0004-0843,1923-1245,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, DIAL, La Jolla, CA 92093 USAOregon State Univ, Dept Geosci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,,,2007-12-01,WOS:000252419100001,,

Due to its qualitative nature and high dependency on sound engineering judgment, screening assessment is vulnerable to human biases and errors, and thus subject to output variability and threatens the integrity of the assets. This paper attempts to tackle these challenges by utilizing a machine learning approach to conduct screening assessment. A case study using a dataset of RBI assessment for oil and gas production and processing units is provided, to illustrate the development of an intelligent system, based on a machine learning model for performing RBI screening assessment. The best performing model achieves accuracy and precision of 92.33% and 84.58%, respectively. A comparative analysis between the performance of the intelligent system and the conventional assessment is performed to examine the benefits of applying the machine learning approach in the RBI screening assessment.

The purpose of the study is to determine managerial practices that undermine trust in the company by the stakeholders in a situation of risk concern, to explore why this happens and to develop practical implications for the formation of trust in a company under such situations. Four approaches to trust theory - a rational choice under risk, an act of faith, a psychological condition and a moral attitude - form the theoretical basis of the study. Stakeholder risk concern is examined by drawing on the example of the industrial development of the Arctic by the Gazprom group of companies (Gazprom Neft, Gazprom Neft Shelf, Gazprom). The research examines the position of environmental NGOs, Russian Bird Conservation Union, WWF Russia, Greenpeace Russia and Bellona-Murmansk. Data include press releases of these environmental organizations and other archival documents in which representatives of the environmental organizations express their concerns about the actions of the Gazprom group of companies in the development of the Prirazlomnoe oil field. The author identifies seven managerial practices that may seem reasonable for managers but undermine trust in the company and increase stakeholder concern.

However, global temperature excluding short-term variability now exceeds +1(circle)C relative to the 1880-1920 mean and annual 2016 global temperature was almost +1.3(circle)C. We show that global temperature has risen well out of the Holocene range and Earth is now as warm as it was during the prior (Eemian) interglacial period, when sea level reached 6-9m higher than today. Further, Earth is out of energy balance with present atmospheric composition, implying that more warming is in the pipeline, and we show that the growth rate of greenhouse gas climate forcing has accelerated markedly in the past decade. The rapidity of ice sheet and sea level response to global temperature is difficult to predict, but is dependent on the magnitude of warming. Targets for limiting global warming thus, at minimum, should aim to avoid leaving global temperature at Eemian or higher levels for centuries. Such targets now require negative emissions, i.e., extraction of CO2 from the air. If phasedown of fossil fuel emissions begins soon, improved agricultural and forestry practices, including reforestation and steps to improve soil fertility and increase its carbon content, may provide much of the necessary CO2 extraction. In that case, the magnitude and duration of global temperature excursion above the natural range of the current interglacial (Holocene) could be limited and irreversible climate impacts could be minimized. In contrast, continued high fossil fuel emissions today place a burden on young people to undertake massive technological CO2 extraction if they are to limit climate change and its consequences. Proposed methods of extraction such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or air capture of CO2 have minimal estimated costs of USD 89-535 trillion this century and also have large risks and uncertain feasibility. Continued high fossil fuel emissions unarguably sentences young people to either a massive, implausible cleanup or growing deleterious climate impacts or both.",,,,,,,,,162,1,0,0,37,0,166,,,2190-4979,2190-4987,,,,,,,,,,"Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Climate Sci Awareness & Solut, New York, NY 10115 USAMercator Ocean, 10 Rue Hermes, F-31520 Ramonville St Agne, FranceUniv Sheffield, Leverhulme Ctr Climate Change Mitigat, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, EnglandInst Earth Environm, Key Lab Aerosol Chem & Phys, SKLLQG, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaUniv Wisconsin, Dept Geosci, 1215 W Dayton St,Weeks Hall, Madison, WI 53706 USAUniv Paris Saclay, CEA, CNRS, UVSQ,Inst Pierre Simon Laplace,Lab Sci Climat & E, Gif Sur Yvette, FranceUniv Calif Irvine, Earth Syst Sci Dept, Irvine, CA 92717 USAAustralian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 2601, AustraliaUniv Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, EnglandBoston Coll, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USAUniv Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, 23 St Machar Dr, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, ScotlandNASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USASciSpace LLC, 2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA",Mercator OceanSciSpace LLC,,,2017-07-18,WOS:000405777900001,,

Carbon dioxide production was measured daily for 42?d. Aerobic alkane, total hydrocarbon, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degraders were enumerated in treated and control mesocosms and changes in their abundances were measured weekly. Hydrocarbon mineralization occurred in all treatments. In the inorganic nutrient-amended treatments, the degradation rates were 2.31 and 2.00 times greater in the 2,000?mg/kg diesel and crude oil treatments, respectively, and 3.52 (diesel) and 4.14 (crude) times higher for the fuel types at the 4,000?mg/kg fuel concentrations compared to unamended treatments. Microbial lag phases were short (<3?d) and alkane and total hydrocarbon degrader numbers increased by five orders of magnitude compared to the uncontaminated treatments within 7?d in most treatments. Hydrocarbon degrader numbers in diesel and in crude oil treatments were similar; however, the PAH degraders were more abundant in the crude oil relative to diesel treatment.

This global warming will lead to substantial changes of climate, many of which will impact human communities in deleterious ways. In terms of the likely global pattern of climate change over the twenty-first century, in the absence of any mitigating action the global average temperature is likely to rise by between about 1-5 and 5-5degreesC and sea level by about half a metre (range 0(.)1-0(.)9 m). The hydrological cycle is likely to be more intense (leading in some places to more frequent and more intense floods and droughts) and the rate of climate change is likely to be substantially greater than the earth has experienced over at least the last ten thousand years. It is particularly to this rapid rate of change that it will be difficult for many ecosystems and for humans to adapt. Action has been taken by the world's scientists through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to assess as thoroughly as possible knowledge regarding the basic science and the impacts, including an assessment of the uncertainties. The world's governments have also taken action in setting up the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) at the Earth Summit in 1992 and at subsequent meetings of the parties to that convention, especially that at Kyoto in 1997. In order to mitigate climate change the FCCC in its article 2 has set the objective of stabilisation of the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level and on a timescale consistent with the needs both of the environment and of sustainable development. Such stabilisation will eventually demand severe cuts in global emissions, for instance of carbon dioxide, to levels well below today's by the second half of the twenty-first century. To achieve the required reductions in the emissions of carbon dioxide, three possibilities are available, to sequester carbon dioxide resulting from the burning of fossil fuels rather than releasing it to the atmosphere, to become much more efficient in the generation and use of energy, and to provide for energy supply from non-fossiI fuel sources. This article will summarise the science of climate change including the evidence for it and will describe the main impacts, the actions taken so far, and the further actions that are likely to be necessary to mitigate climate change.",,,,,,,,,33,2,0,0,19,0,43,,,0308-0188,,,,,,,,,,,"Meteorol Off, Hadley Ctr, Bracknell RG12 2SY, Berks, England",,,,2001-12-01,WOS:000174439100005,,

The traits were recorded on seven discrete year-classes: five year-classes for vibriosis (11,936 individuals), two year-classes for VNN (6185 individuals) and five year-classes for BW (22,703 individuals), with each trait recorded on separate sub-samples of the full-sib families. Three genetic groups were defined in the dataset: coastal cod south (CCS), coastal cod north (CCN) and north-east Arctic cod (NEAC). Significant differences between the groups were found only for VNN resistance, with expected survival rates of (approx.) 52% vs. 13% in CCS and NEAC, respectively. Furthermore, significant favorable heterosis was estimated for BW (+ 147 g) and vibriosis resistance (similar to 22% relative increase in survival). All three traits had significant heritability estimates, with a moderate heritability for vibriosis resistance (0.16 +/- 0.04), exceptionally high heritability for VNN resistance (0.68 +/- 0.14) and a moderate to high heritability for BW (0.28 +/- 0.05). All estimated genetic correlations between the traits were weak and not significantly different from zero. Common environmental family effects explained 5.6% and 6.6% of the liability variance for vibriosis and VNN, and 8.6% of the phenotypic variance for BW. The significant heritabilities and low genetic correlations indicate that joint genetic improvement of vibriosis resistance, VNN resistance and growth rate would be feasible. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

As potential pathways toward a net-zero-power system, this work analyzes future power systems based on intermittent renewable electricity with long-term storage through chemical energy carriers, so called Power-to-Fuel-to-Power systems, and a system based on the combustion of natural gas with 100% carbon capture and storage. The chemical energy carriers selected for electricity storage are hydrogen, methane and ammonia. Using life cycle assessment, we determine and compare the environmental impacts of 1 kWh of dispatchable electricity produced by the two pathways on seven impact categories. There was not one single pathway that had the most environmental benefits on all seven impact categories. Of the Power-to-Fuel-to-Power systems assessed the use of hydrogen for storage has the lowest environmental impact in all categories. Additionally, all the Power-to-Fuel-to-Power systems have a lower environmental impact on climate change, photochemical ozone formation and fossil resource depletion compared with the natural gas with carbon capture and storage system. The natural gas with carbon capture and storage system has a lower environmental impact on particulate matter formation, marine eutrophication and mineral resource scarcity. Our work is complemented by an analysis of pathways from a net-zero-direct-CO2 to a life-cycle net-zero-CO2-equivalent power system which is actually climate neutral, achieved by direct air capture of the residual CO2 from the atmosphere. However, this leads to an increase in all other impact categories of 11% for the Power-to-Fuel-to-Power systems and 21% in the natural gas combustion with carbon capture and storage system. A system sizing study also highlights the very low capacity factors of the capital employed for electricity storage, raising the point of economic feasibility.

For future requirements, it may be necessary to operate at depths greater than those at which divers can function safely or efficiently and to have the capability of joining materials other than C-Mn steels.Thus, the advent of laser welding may introduce a potentially more flexible system by developing new applications previously not possible with the existing techniques. Specifically targeted areas are the installation and repair of pipelines or structural members and root welding of pipelines. The environment in which this welding will be required may be under wet or hyperbaric conditions. Therefore, the marinisation of the laser welding system, with the aim of assessing the feasibility of implementing a remote welding system controlled either locally or from a surface position, is also a necessary consideration.A brief review of current underwater welding technology is covered, and the feasibility of implementing lasers in the offshore environment is discussed.

The wireline logging data were reprocessed, core-calibrated and interpreted in the framework of reservoir and seal characterization for carbon dioxide storage. Particular attention is paid to the capabilities and limitations of borehole spectroscopy for chemical characterization of basalt. Neutron capture spectroscopy logging is shown to provide accurate concentrations for up to 8 major and minor elements but has limited sensitivity to natural alteration in fresh-water basaltic reservoirs. The Wallula borehole intersected 26 flows from 7 members of the Grande Ronde formation. The logging data demonstrate a cyclic pattern of sequential basalt flows with alternating porous flow tops (potential reservoirs) and massive flow interiors (potential caprock). The log-derived apparent porosity is extremely high in the flow tops (20-45%), and considerably overestimates effective porosity obtained from hydraulic testing. The flow interiors are characterized by low apparent porosity (0-8%) but appear pervasively fractured in borehole images. Electrical resistivity images show diverse volcanic textures and provide an excellent tool for fracture analysis, but neither fracture density nor log-derived porosity uniquely correlate with hydraulic properties of the Grande Ronde formation. While porous flow tops in these deep flood basalts may offer reservoirs with high mineralization rates, long leakage migration paths, and thick sections of caprock for CO2 storage, a more extensive multiwell characterization would be necessary to assess lateral variations and establish sequestration capacity in this reservoir.",,,,,,,,,30,1,0,0,6,1,32,,,,1525-2027,,,,,,,,,,"Columbia Univ, Borehole Res Grp, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USAPacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USASchlumberger Doll Res Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,,2012-12-05,WOS:000310691100001,,

The experiments are performed for seawater with slicks of crude oil, crude oil-dispersant mixture and dispersant only. The measurements investigate the effects of wave energy and slick properties on the temporal evolution of the emissions. The total number concentrations of particles originating from the oil dispersant mixture are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those of crude oil across the entire nano-scale range, reaching 100x for 20 nm particles. Conversely, the differences in concentration are small in the micron range. The average concentrations of pPAH are variable but similar (150-270 ng/m(3)). The VOC concentrations for crude oil-dispersant mixtures are 2-3 times lower than those of crude oil, presumably due to the surfactant effect on mass diffusion. The drastic increase in ultrafine particle concentrations may raise concerns about effects of inhalation by cleanup workers and downstream communities though VOC emissions reduce.

Genetic families include Jurassic Smackover, Flexure Trend, Upper Cretaceous, and Paleogene oils. Smackover oils have high sulfur contents, pristane/phytane ratios < 1.0, CPI < 1.0, abundant extended hopanes, C35/C34 hopane ratios greater-than-or-equal-to 1.0, and C30/C29 hopane ratios usually less-than-or-equal-to 1.0. Flexure Trend oils are similar and contain abundant extended hopanes, high sulfur contents, and V/(Ni + V) > 0.5; these oils are inferred to be sourced in Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous strata. Upper Cretaceous oils contain a distinctive suite of tricyclic and nonhopanoid triterpanes; oleanane is low or absent. Paleogene oils can be recognized by the presence of 18-alpha(H) oleanane and a lack of extended hopanes. These oils occur from south Texas to southern and offshore Louisiana. Two subfamilies can be recognized based on the relative abundance of triterpanes and steranes. These oils have a presumed Paleogene source. Mixing of oil types is quite prevalent at the geographic boundaries of oil types.The initial control on the distribution of oil and gas in the northern Gulf of Mexico is provided by the areal extent of source rocks. Secondary control is due to Cenozoic deposition, which provides the thermal stress to generate, as well as destroy, oil. Salt tectonics provide conduits for migrating fluids to escape the zone of thermal destruction.

Despite their importance, multiple interacting controls over landscape-level variation in foliar N and ACD are poorly understood. We assessed the relative importance of individual ecologically important state factors (climate, substrate, age, vegetation, and topography) associated with canopy foliar N and ACD throughout a humid forest landscape. We combined high-resolution remotely sensed data, machine learning, and field data to map and assess canopy foliar N and ACD patterns across a 5016-ha forest reserve in Hawai'i. Distance to non-native forests had the largest relative influence on canopy foliar N concentration, followed by mean annual temperature (MAT), vegetation type, precipitation, soil, canopy height, and substrate age. In contrast, soil type was the strongest determinant of spatial variability in ACD, followed by precipitation, MAT, and vegetation type. Similar to foliar N, climate and vegetation variables were associated with ACD. However, soil type was found to be much more important in the ACD model (30%) than in the foliar N model (4%). Landscape-scale patterns in canopy foliar N and ACD are the result of shifts in vegetation type and composition, most likely due to species' responses to past disturbances, current climate conditions, and available nutrients.

This trend is widely considered to be the result of multidecadal and global scale growth stimulation arising from increases in atmospheric CO2 and temperatures. However, contrasting patterns have been recorded across the tropics, and the role of disturbance in driving biomass and stem dynamics has been highlighted as an alternative explanation. Australian tropical forests have rarely been assessed in pan-tropical analyses of long-term dynamics. We have measured recruitment, mortality and growth in 20 permanent plots in tropical forest across north-eastern Australia since 1971. We assess changes in plot level above-ground live biomass (AGB) and stem density, and compare our results with those documented over a similar time frame in the neo-tropics. No significant increase in AGB was found over the 40-year time period. Above-ground biomass tended to increase over the first two decades of the monitoring period and decrease in the final two with gain terms (growth and recruitment) lower than loss terms (mortality) by the final decade (2000s). Stem density significantly decreased over the monitoring period with recruitment consistently lower than mortality. There was large variation in individual plots in their pattern of AGB and stem density changes over time which was consistent with the response of each plot to known disturbance events, including cyclones, pathogen outbreaks and drought. Our results are in contrast to those described for neo-tropical plots which appear to show a widespread pattern of increasing growth and stem density.Synthesis. The trend towards increasing biomass and stem density of tropical forests described for the neo-tropics does not necessarily reflect patterns in areas of the tropics where large-scale natural disturbances are relatively frequent. Australian tropical rain forests are either not increasing in productivity in response to global change, or cyclones and other regional and local mechanisms of change mask any evidence of larger-scale patterns.",,,,,,,,,21,1,0,0,21,1,29,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,,,,,,,"CSIRO Ecosyst Sci Trop Forest Res Ctr, Atherton, Qld 4883, AustraliaMontpellier SupAgro, F-34060 Montpellier 1, FranceCSIRO Ecosyst Sci EcoSci Precinct, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia",,,,2013-11-14,WOS:000325984300022,,

This section connects the pipe that runs on the seabed to the production facility, be it a floating platform or a FPSO.Hanging from the platform over deep waters, risers are subject to very extreme operating conditions such as high loads and underwater currents. Corrosion, fatigue, abrasion and damages caused by stray object collisions are factors that must be taken into account, so that oil and gas production are not compromised. A flexible pipeline, a well engineered solution used in most riser installations, provides high reliability while requiring little maintenance but, in spite of advances in project and installation, the inspection of riser pipelines is an immature field where technology has not yet met the user's demands.In the search for better riser inspection techniques, a project was started to design a new inspection tool. The basic concept consists of an autonomous vehicle, the Autonomous Underwater Riser Inspection tool (AURI), that uses the riser itself for guidance.The AURI tool can control its own velocity and is suited to carry different types of inspection devices. The first AURI prototype is designed to perform visual inspection with an built-in camera system, covering 100% of the external riser surface. The AURI can reach water depths up to a thousand meters. It was built with several embedded security mechanisms to ensure tool recovery in case of failure and also to minimize chances of damage to the pipeline or other equipment. It uses two electrical thrusters to push it along the riser. The mission is set to a maximum depth to be inspected and is considered complete when one of the following conditions is met: (1) maximum pressure on depth sensor is reached or (2) the length of the run is achieved or (3) maximum mission duration is exceeded or (4) maximum allowed tilt is detected by the inclinometer. Thanks to its positive buoyancy, the AURI will always return to the surface even if the electronics fail or the batteries get exhausted.

Such biological sulfide production is a detrimental, widespread phenomenon in the petroleum industry, occurring within oil reservoirs or in topside processing facilities, under low- and high-temperature conditions, and in onshore or offshore operations. Sulfate reducers can exist either indigenously in deep subsurface reservoirs or can be inoculated into a reservoir system during oilfield development (e.g., via drilling operations) or during the oil production phase. In the latter, souring most commonly occurs during water flooding, a secondary recovery strategy wherein water is injected to re-pressurize the reservoir and sweep the oil towards production wells to extend the production life of an oilfield. The water source and type of production operation can provide multiple components such as sulfate, labile carbon sources, and sulfate-reducing communities that influence whether oilfield souring occurs. Souring can be controlled by biocides, which can non-specifically suppress microbial populations, and by the addition of nitrate (and/or nitrite) that directly impacts the sulfate-reducing population by numerous competitive or inhibitory mechanisms. In this review, we report on the diversity of sulfate reducers associated with oil reservoirs, approaches for determining their presence and effects, the factors that control souring, and the approaches (along with the current understanding of their underlying mechanisms) that may be used to successfully mitigate souring in low-temperature and high-temperature oilfield operations.",,,,,,,,,196,10,1,0,143,1,229,,,0175-7598,1432-0614,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, CanadaUniv Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Petr Microbiol Res Grp, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",,,,2011-10-01,WOS:000295325300005,21858492,

Past studies done under diverse conditions yielded conflicting results about the effects of shoot density on flow through seagrass bed canopies. We used eelgrass, Zostera marina, to study how the density of flexible shoots affect the hydrodynamics of seagrass beds in unidirectional water flow. By exposing randomly-arranged shoots of uniform length to current velocities controlled in a flume, the effects of shoot density and distance downstream from the bed edge could be determined without confounding factors. Comparison of velocity profiles within beds to those upstream of beds showed that flow was slower in the beds. However, shoot density, downstream distance, and current velocity did not affect the percent reduction in flow velocity in a bed. Turbulence enhances mixing of substances carried in the water. Here, turbulence intensity (index of the importance of turbulent velocity fluctuations relative to average current velocity) was lower when ambient flow was faster, but was not affected by shoot density or downstream position, Drag (hydrodynamic force on a shoot that bends it over in the flow direction) provides another measure of how the canopy affects flow experienced by a shoot. Drag was not affected by current velocity, shoot density, or downstream position in the bed. Gaps between shoots can enhance light and flow penetration into the canopy, but when shoots are bent over by flow, they can cover gaps. Faster ambient currents caused greater gap closure, which at each current speed was greater for high shoot densities. Thus, canopy gap closure did not correlate with percent flow reduction in grass beds or with drag on individual shoots, both of which were independent of shoot density and ambient current velocity. Since changing shoot density does not affect the flow in a grass bed exposed to a given ambient current, our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the high shoot densities observed in grass beds in habitats exposed to rapid flow are due to a direct, adaptive response of the grass to the flow environment.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,19,0,26,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"CSA Ocean Sci Inc, Stuart, FL 34997 USAFlorida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Coastal Oceans Res, Miami, FL 33199 USAUniv Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",CSA Ocean Sci Inc,,,2019-07-09,WOS:000474404800001,,

In addition to a more conventional steel configuration, two different fiber materials, carbon and glass, are considered as construction materials for pressure vessels (PVs) to be stored on board ships, with thickness optimized by FEM analysis.The considered scenario is represented by the transportation of CNG from an offshore well to a terminal on shore. Fleets of ships carrying CNG in pressure vessels manufactured with the investigated materials are generated by means of a ship synthesis model (SSM) software and compared on the basis of technical and economical indicators.The choice of the construction material influences considerably the weight of the PVs, which represent a major item of total ship weight and reflects directly on the general transport performances in terms of resistance, seakeeping and reliability in the service. On the other hand, capital as well as operating expenditures are considerably affected by the choice. When exploring the design space, the ship synthesis model is able, at a preliminary stage of the design, to account for the various technical and economical aspects, their implications and relationships. Results are presented of computations carried out in a specific case, identified by the annual gas production and other characteristics of the well terminal and a cruising route for the ships. The comparison is carried out on the basis of the cost per transported unit of gas and of the percentage of success in the transportation process. The computations show that the choice of the PV material has a key influence on the results in terms of optimal number, dimensions and speed of the ships. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Submerged archaeological sites including cargoes from shipwrecks or ancient city ruins have been a topic of interest from a perspective of in situ musealization, as a way of making underwater cultural heritage accessible to the public. In an experimental study conducted at an underwater archaeological site in the Bay of Cadiz (SW Spain), we subjected two types of marble (Carrara and Macael) to three conditions to which submerged archaeological objects are often exposed: full exposure to the water column, natural processes of burial and unearthing, or permanent burial. After an 18-month study period, the factor found to mostly affect these materials was their biological colonization. This factor was assessed by estimating total surface biocover and the rate of surface biocolonization, and also through the identification of skeletons and associated alteration forms by light microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Biofouling and bioerosion were the main causes of biodeterioration and dependent on the position of the marble specimens in the seawater. The response of both materials was similar, though dolomite crystals in the Carrara marble acted as a protective barrier against actively penetrating microorganisms. These investigations have allowed the study of tracers left by epilithic encrusting organisms and endolithic bioeroders on marbles intentionally exposed to seawater, providing new insights to the understanding of the biodeterioration processes occurring in cultural heritage stones, with significant implications when they are part of underwater archaeological remains.

It is sometimes assumed that old- growth forests can serve as fixed, steady-state storage of biomass and carbon for indefinitely long periods, but it is shown by both modelling and remote sensing that forests are dynamic systems, the state of which can change considerably over as short a time as a decade. Forecasting methods show that maximum biomass and carbon storage in some important forest types occurs in mid-succession, not in old-growth. It is proposed, therefore, that realistic biomass and carbon storage estimates used for carbon credits and offsets be determined as the statistical mean minus the confidence interval and that practical carbon sequestering programs include specific timeframes, not indefinitely long periods of time.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1644-3985,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAQueensland Herbarium, Toowong, AustraliaUniv Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland Herbarium,,,2015-02-25,WOS:000348606600001,,

The required pipe wall thickness (WT) to resist internal and external pressures is commonly determined using a hoop stress formula. Several hoop stress formulas have been used in the industry codes [1-4] but most of them do not correctly account for external pressure.There are two types of formulas available in calculating hoop stress; a thin wall pipe formula and a thick wall pipe formula. The thin wall pipe formula is simpler and easier to use, but it is not accurate for thick wall pipes and high external pressures. The thick wall pipe formula gives an accurate solution, but the formula is complicated and does not give the required WT directly, so it is not widely used.In this paper, a modified thin wall pipe formula (very simple but moderately accurate) and an improved hoop stress formula (less simple but very accurate) are introduced to improve the accuracy of the thin wall pipe formula and to reduce the complexity of the thick wall pipe formula.Eventually, the pipe WT may be governed by collapse, bending buckling, or installation restraints (such as reeling requirements), but it is true that the hoop stress formula is useful to initially check for the required pipe WT. The purpose of this paper is to draw special attention when using the thin wall pipe hoop stress formula with the (P-i - P-o) term. If the external pressure is to be considered, the proposed modified thin wall pipe formula (containing an extra -P-o term) or the improved hoop stress formula (containing another extra -0.4 (P-i - P-o) term) is recommended.",,,,,OCEANS MTS/IEEE ConferenceOCEANS MTS/IEEE Conference,"MAY 21-24, 2012MAY 21-24, 2012",Marine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc (IEEE OES); Korean Assoc Ocean Sci & Technol Soc (KAOSTS)Marine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc (IEEE OES); Korean Assoc Ocean Sci & Technol Soc (KAOSTS),"Yeosu, SOUTH KOREAYeosu, SOUTH KOREA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4577-2091-8,,,,,,,,,"Genesis Oil & Gas, Pipeline Dept, Houston, TX 77079 USA",Genesis Oil & Gas,,,2012-11-19,WOS:000309461400262,,

Following the Prestige wreck, Cu (4.3-10 mu g g(-1)) and Pb concentrations (1.0-1.4 mu g g(-1)) were, respectively, between two and five times higher than pre-spill levels (1.5-3.6 and 0.1-0.4 mu g g(-1)), but returned to previous background concentrations after three years.

The dissolved gaseous CO2 presents naturally, or that generated by acidification of the sample, is separated by diffusion using a hydrophobic semipermeable gas porous membrane, and the permeating gas is incorporated into a stream of deionised water and measured by means of an electrical conductometric microdetector. In order to make the system suitable and easy to use for in-field measurements aboard oceanographic ships, the single components of the analyser were compacted into a robust and easy to use system. The calibration of the system is carried out by using standard solutions of potassium bicarbonate at two concentration ranges. Calibration and sample measurements are carried out inside a temperature-constant chamber at 25 A degrees C and in an inert atmosphere (N-2). The detection and quantification limits of the method, evaluated as 3 and 10 times the standard deviation of a series of measurements of the matrix solution were 2.9 and 9.6 mu mol/kg of CO2, respectively. Data quality for dissolved inorganic carbon was checked with replicate measurements of a certified reference material (A. Dickson, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego), both accuracy and repeatability were -3.3% and 10%, respectively. Optimization, performance qualification of the system and its application in various natural water samples are reported and discussed. In the future, the calibration step will be operated automatically in order to improve the analytical performance and the applicability will be increased in the course of experimental surveys carried out both in marine and freshwater ecosystems.

Therefore, this paper aims to present a device, multifunctional oil-injection equipment (MOIE), expected to be able to purify hydraulic oil in deep-sea hydraulic systems. Its major functions are to absorb oil, remove impurities and fill oil, among which the removal of water and gas, i.e. dewatering and degassing, is of significance. Theoretical analysis shows that the paper oil filter is able to remove the solid particles in hydraulic oil, and degassing and dewatering of hydraulic oil could be achieved through vacuum filtration and vacuum heating in high-temperature and low-pressure environment.

Stakeholder concern often focuses on the potential for local displacement caused by impact piling, where piles are hammered into the seabed. To mitigate this threat, use of vibration piling, where piles are shaken into place with a vibratory hammer, is often encouraged due to presumed impact reduction. However, data on comparative responses of cetaceans to these different noise sources are lacking. We studied the responses of bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises to both impact and vibration pile driving noise during harbor construction works in northeast Scotland, using passive acoustic monitoring devices to record cetacean activity and noise recorders to measure and predict received noise levels. Local abundance and patterns of occurrence of bottlenose dolphins were also compared with a five-year baseline. The median peak-to-peak source level estimated for impact piling was 240 dB re 1 muPa (single-pulse sound exposure level [SEL] 198 dB re 1 muPa2 s), and the r.m.s. source level for vibration piling was 192 dB re 1 muPa. Predicted received broadband SEL values 812 m from the piling site were markedly lower due to high propagation loss: 133.4 dB re 1 muPa2 s (impact) and 128.9 dB re 1 muPa2 s (vibration). Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises were not excluded from sites in the vicinity of impact piling or vibration piling; nevertheless, some small effects were detected. Bottlenose dolphins spent a reduced period of time in the vicinity of construction works during both impact and vibration piling. The probability of occurrence of both cetacean species was also slightly less during periods of vibration piling. This work provides developers and managers with the first evidence of the comparative effects of vibration and impact piling on small cetaceans, enabling more informed risk assessments, policy frameworks, and mitigation plans. In particular, our results emphasize the need for better understanding of noise levels and behavioral responses to vibration piling before recommending its use to mitigate impact piling.

This study also explores the availability of these waste materials by performing a statistical analysis in a good number of countries worldwide. The statistical study was performed starting with a study on which countries generate waste the most overall, followed by examining multiple countries and investigating their top three most available waste. The results showed that the USA is the leading country in terms of municipal solid waste generation of 258 million metric tons, followed by China that generates around 220.4 million metric tons and then India that generates 168.4 million metric tons of municipal solid waste. The regions that generate the most food waste are North America and Oceania, providing the availability of food waste in those regions. Most of the palm tree wastes are available in the Middle East and some parts of the USA, while green waste can be found in the USA, China, and the UK. Sawdust wastes are mostly available in Europe and North America, while hay waste is abundant in the USA. Waste materials were also examined for various petroleum industry applications. Food wastes were found to be effective in drilling and completion fluids. Various food waste products were utilized to alter the drilling fluid properties such as potato peels and mandarin peels. Food wastes were also effective in altering the pH of the drilling fluids. Some plant-based wastes such as date trees were effective treatments used to stop lost circulation. Based on biodegradability and toxicity basis, waste materials were also classified into four main categories, which are eco-friendly, biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and toxic using color category classification. In summary, waste materials have the potential to be used in the petroleum industry, and they might as well be a good alternative for the future.

By using waste materials as drilling fluid additives, the cost of the drilling fluid can be minimized.

It is shown here that the results of such ocean-centered studies are very sensitive to the assumption made about the response of the carbon reservoirs on the atmospheric side of the sea surface. Assumptions made include prescribed atmospheric pCO(2), an interactive atmospheric CO2 pool exchanging carbon with the ocean but not with the terrestrial biosphere, and an interactive atmosphere that exchanges carbon with both oceanic and terrestrial carbon pools. The impact of these assumptions on simulated annual to millennial oceanic carbon uptake is investigated for a hypothetical increase in the C:N ratio of the biological pump and for an idealized enhancement of phytoplankton growth. Compared to simulations with interactive atmosphere, using prescribed atmospheric pCO(2) overestimates the sensitivity of the oceanic CO2 uptake to changes in the biological pump, by about 2%, 25%, 100%, and >500% on annual, decadal, centennial, and millennial timescales, respectively. The smaller efficiency of the oceanic carbon uptake under an interactive atmosphere is due to the back flux of CO2 that occurs when atmospheric CO2 is reduced. Adding an interactive terrestrial carbon pool to the atmosphere-ocean model system has a small effect on annual timescales, but increases the simulated fertilization-induced oceanic carbon uptake by about 4%, 50%, and 100% on decadal, centennial, and millennial timescales, respectively, for pCO(2) sensitivities of the terrestrial carbon storage in the middle range of the C4MIP models (Friedlingstein et al., 2006).

A Multiline Ring Anchor (MRA) is a ring-shaped anchor designed to be deeply embedded in offshore soils for the purposes of anchoring multiple floating platforms. The increase in offshore development in the wind energy, wave energy and aquaculture sectors requires multiple closely spaced nominally identical platforms that need this type of omni-directional anchor. This novel configuration differs substantially from the typical oil and gas installation and allows consideration of sharing anchors among multiple platforms, thereby driving down capital, material, fabrication and installation costs and duration significantly. Previous simulation-based research conducted by the research team has shown that this concept is feasible but that truly leveraging the advantages of multiline anchoring will require novel anchor designs that can be installed quickly and inexpensively and that also deliver omni-directional capacity and resistance to cyclic loading. To achieve this, the research team will develop models for the loading placed on the anchors from wind, waves and other forces; perform reduced-scale centrifuge tests to provide data on the behavior of MRA systems under these loads; and develop numerical models to assess the behavior of the anchors under multiple loading scenarios. This research project includes a collaboration with an industrial partner, Vryhof Anchors, to ensure that results are driven by the needs of industry and can move rapidly to further industry-driven technology development. In order to demonstrate proof-of-concept for the MRA, a series of research tasks are planned that will quantify stochastic and time-varying loads placed on the anchor by wind, wave and aquaculture platforms. Additionally, the team will develop conceptual MRA designs based on finite element and plastic limit analysis and assess the suitability of the MRA for sand and clay conditions by a range of methods including centrifuge testing. These tasks will enable the development of fundamental understanding of the response of embedded anchors to cyclic and directionally varying loading. The team will deliver a system evaluation for realistic installations that will provide the impetus for further demonstration-scale research into the MRA. Fundamental advances in understanding the dynamics of interconnected offshore systems as well as the response of deeply embedded anchors in different types of soil to complex loading form the core of the intellectual merit.

Tidal energy converters (turbines) are being developed in many countries as part of attempts to reduce reliance on hydrocarbon fuels. However, the moving blades of tidal turbines pose potential collision risks for marine animals. Accurate assessment of mortality risk as a result of collisions is essential for risk management during planning and consenting processes for marine energy developments. In the absence of information on the physical consequences of such collisions, predicting likely risks relies on theoretical collision risk models. The application of these at a population level usually assumes that all collisions result in mortality. This is unlikely and the approach therefore produces upwardly biased estimates of population consequences. 2. In this study, we estimate the pathological consequences of direct collisions with tidal turbines using seal carcasses and physical models of tidal turbine blades. We quantify severe trauma at a range of impact speeds and to different areas of seal carcasses. A dose-response model was developed with associated uncertainty to determine an impact speed threshold of severe trauma to use in future collision risk models. 3. Results showed that severe trauma was: a. restricted to the thoracic region, with no evidence of injury to the lumbar or cervical spine. b. only observed in collision speeds in excess of 5.6 m.s-1 (95% c.i. 4.4 to 6.6). c. affected by body condition; increasing blubber depth reduced the likelihood of severe trauma 4. Synthesis and applications: This study provides important information for policy makers and regulators looking to predict the potential impacts of tidal turbines on marine mammals. We demonstrate that the probability of severe trauma in seals due to collisions with turbine blades is highly dependent upon collision speed, and that the majority of predicted collisions are unlikely to cause fatal skeletal trauma. We recommend that collision risk models incorporate appropriate mortality assumptions to ensure accurate estimates of the population consequences are produced in risk assessments for tidal turbine deployments. Post-trial scansThese images show the post-trial, 3-dimensional scans of the seal skeletons which were used for analysis. Some images are focussed on points of interest to show the important injuries identified for that individual. Relation back to collision speeds and morphometric data can be made through the published manuscript which details collision speeds for each individual and a full list of pathological indicators of mortality which were identified.

Anthropogenic loss hotspots across Southeast Asia and around the world have characterized the ecosystem as highly threatened, though natural processes such as erosion can also play a significant role in forest vulnerability. However, the extent of human and natural threats has not been fully quantified at the global scale. Here, using a Random Forest-based analysis of over one million Landsat images, we present the first 30 m resolution global maps of the drivers of mangrove loss from 2000 to 2016, capturing both human-driven and natural stressors. We estimate that 62% of global losses between 2000 and 2016 resulted from land-use change, primarily through conversion to aquaculture and agriculture. Up to 80% of these human-driven losses occurred within six Southeast Asian nations, reflecting the regional emphasis on enhancing aquaculture for export to support economic development. Both anthropogenic and natural losses declined between 2000 and 2016, though slower declines in natural loss caused an increase in their relative contribution to total global loss area. We attribute the decline in anthropogenic losses to the regionally dependent combination of increased emphasis on conservation efforts and a lack of remaining mangroves viable for conversion. While efforts to restore and protect mangroves appear to be effective over decadal timescales, the emergence of natural drivers of loss presents an immediate challenge for coastal adaptation.

The overall objective of this project is to better understand the spatio-temporal structure of the turbulent inflow and wakes at scales relevant to marine hydrokinetic energy conversion. A suite of state-of-the-art experimental fluid dynamics instrumentation will be employed for turbulence characterization, and both laboratory and open water (tidal estuary) test facilities will be used. The study will focus on tidal energy, however, the results are applicable to ocean and river current energy conversion and wave energy as well. Intellectual Merit: MHK energy conversion devices are subjected to a wide range of turbulent scales. For example, the fastest tidal currents often occur in regions of complex bathymetry, which creates complex boundary layers and flow distortions in locations where MHK devices will be sited. Initial tests have shown that the performance of MHK devices, as well as structural fatigue and failure, are closely linked to turbulence. Downstream, turbulence generated by MHK devices and their support structures can have an effect on the environment and organisms in the water column. The robust Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) commonly used for open water measurements are limited to low sampling rates due to their operational principle, which results in insufficient spatial resolution for scales of turbulence relevant to MHK devices. On the other hand, experimental techniques with higher temporal and spatial resolution are typically limited to laboratory environments. For this project, turbulent inflow and hydrokinetic turbine wakes will first be measured in a large cross-section combined tow-wave tank comparing ADCPs, multi-point Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) and underwater high frame-rate Particle Image Velocimetry (HFR-PIV), to establish baselines on how each instrument measures spatio-temporal flow structures. Then turbulent inflow and hydrokinetic turbine wakes will be measured at an open-water tidal energy test site comparing ADCP and ADV. Data from the laboratory and the open-water deployments will be used in mathematical modeling with low-dimensional model and stochastic estimation techniques to predict turbulent flow states from ADCP profiles and ADV reference measurements. The project will thus fill an instrumentation ?scale gap? that currently exists. Broader Impacts: The project will produce previously unavailable information on the spatio-temporal structure of MHK-relevant flows. It will improve our understanding of the capabilities of the different measurement techniques in an MHK environment and create general predictive tools, which will make possible the study of other phenomena and processes in the marine environment. The results of this research will enable higher-fidelity resource assessment and more accurate energy conversion device evaluation, yield previously inaccessible flow data for fluid-structure interaction, generate data for device array layouts, facilitate environmental impact assessments, and, ultimately, lead to improved designs. It will thus help the United States? MHK industry to become successful. The integration of research and education activities will be achieved through inclusion of research in senior/graduate courses in Renewable Energy and Experimental Fluid Dynamics, industrial research opportunities as part of graduate training, outreach and continuing education, and participation in university open house events, laboratory tours and demonstrations. The outreach will include activities with the NH Seacoast Science Center and the NH Children?s Museum. Underrepresented groups in engineering will be actively recruited through the UNH Office of Diversity and student societies, to work on the proposed research as undergraduate researchers and potential Ph.D. students. The project will be used to attract students interested in the fields of renewable energy, flow measurement and turbulence, and help train the workforce necessary for advancing this new industry.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1150797,,,,,,,,University of New Hampshire,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13843476,,

Brown coal was found to be the most impactful fuel source, followed by hard coal and diesel fuel, all averaging above the Australian national power generation environmental impacts. The renewable energy fuels, bagasse, landfill gas and sewage gas, exhibited the lowest environmental impacts. Global warming and fine particulate matter formation were the two most impactful contributors ranging between 97 and 99.8% of the human health endpoint impacts, while global warming and terrestrial acidification were the most impactful categories to ecosystems contributing between 98.3 and 100% of the ecosystem endpoint impacts. Global warming impacts on human health and ecosystems were the major impactful categories for all fossil fuels, while fine particulate matter formation and terrestrial acidification contributed with the largest respective impacts on human health and ecosystems by the considered renewable energy technologies. The major identified pollutants of concern for the thermal power generation technologies are emissions of greenhouse gases, acidic gases, such as SO2 and NOx, and PM2.5. As an interim solution, reduction of the impacts from the fossil fuel technologies can be achieved by targeting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, better control of acidic gases SO2 and NOx, and blending of the renewable energy sources, bagasse, landfill gas and sewage gas, with coal and natural gas, however long term solutions would require further reduction in fossil fuel reliance for Australia.

Ice covers have formed in a wide range of plate tectonic and structural settings but the bulk of Earth's glacial record can be shown to have been deposited and preserved in basins within extensional settings. In such basins, source area uplift and basin subsidence fulfill the tectonic preconditions for the initiation of glaciation and the accomodation and preservation of glaciclastic sediments. Tectonic setting, in particular subsidence rates, also dictates the type of glaciclastic facies and facies successions that are deposited. Many pre-Pleistocene glaciated basins commonly contain well-defined tectonostratigraphic successions recording the interplay of tectonics and sedimentation; traditional climatostratigraphic approaches involving interpretation in terms of either ice advance/retreat cycles or glacio-eustatic sea-level change require revision.The direct record of continental glaciation in Earth history, in the form of classically-recognised continental glacial landforms and ''tillites'', is meagre; it is probable that more than 95% of the volume of preserved ''glacial'' strata are glacially-influenced marine deposits that record delivery of large amounts of glaciclastic sediment to offshore basins. This flux has been partially or completely reworked by ''normal'' sedimentary processes such that the record of glaciation and climate change is recorded in marine successions and is difficult to decipher. The dominant ''glacial'' facies in the rock record are subaqueous debris flow diamictites and turbidites recording the selective preservation of poorly-sorted glaciclastic sediment deposited in deep water basins by sediment gravity flows. However, these facies are also typical of many non-glacial settings, especially volcanically-influenced environments; numerous Archean and. Proterozoic diamictites, described in the older literature as tillites, have no clearly established glacial parentage. The same remarks apply to many successions of laminated and thin-bedded facies interpreted as ''varvites''.Despite suggestions of much lower values of solar luminosity (the weak young sun hypothesis), the stratigraphic record Of Archean glaciations is not extensive and may be the result of non-preservation. However, the effects of very different Archean global tectonic regimes and much higher geothermal heat flows, combined with a Venus-like atmosphere warmed by elevated levels of CO2, cannot be ruled out. The oldest unambiguous glacial succession in Earth history appears to be the Early Proterozoic Gowganda Formation of the Huronian Supergroup in Ontario; the age of this event is not well-constrained but glaciation coincided with regional rifting, and may be causally related to, oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere just after 2300 Ma. New evidence that oxygenation is tectonically, not biologically driven, stresses the intimate relationship between plate tectonics, evolution of the atmosphere and glaciation. Global geochemical controls, such as elevated atmospheric CO2 levels, may be responsible for a long mid-Proterozoic non-glacial interval after 2000 Ma that was terminated by the Late Proterozoic glaciations just after 800 Ma.A persistent theme in both Late Proterozoic and Phanerozoic glaciations is the adiabatic effect of tectonic uplift, either along collisional margins or as a result of passive margin uplifts in areas of extended crust, as the trigger for glaciation; the process is reinforced by global geochemical feedback, principally the drawdown of atmospheric CO2 and Milankovitch ''astronomical'' forcing but these are unlikely, by themselves, to inititiate glaciation. The same remarks apply to late Cenozoic glaciations.Late Proterozoic glacially-influenced strata occur on all seven continents and fall into two tectonostratigraphic types. In the first category are thick sucessions of turbidites and mass flows deposited along active, compressional plate margins recording a protracted and complex phase of supercontinent assembly between 800 and 550 Ma. Local cordilleran glaciations of volcanic peaks is indicated. Many deposits are preserved within mobile belts that record the subduction of interior oceans now preserved as ''welds'' between different cratons. Discrimination between glacially-influenced and non-glacial, volcaniclastic mass flow successions continues to be problematic.The second tectonostratigraphic category of Late Proterozoic glacial strata includes successions of glacially-influenced, mostly marine strata deposited along rifted, extensional plate margins. The oldest (Sturtian) glaciclastic sediments result from the break-out of Laurentia from the Late Proterozoic supercontinent starting around 750 Ma along its ''palaeo-Pacific'' margin with a later (Marinoan) phase of rifting at about 650 Ma. ''Passive margin'' uplifts and the generation of ''adiabatic'' ice covers on uplifted crustal blocks triggered widespread glaciation along the ''palaeo-Pacific'' margin of North America and in Australia. A major phase of rifting along the opposite (''palaeo-Atlantic'') margin of Laurentia occurred after 650 Ma and is similarly recorded by glaciclastic strata in basins preserved around the margins of the present day North Atlantic Ocean.Glaciation of the west African platform after 650 Ma is closely related to collision of the West African and Guyanan cratons and uplift of the orogenic belt; the same process, involving uplift around the northern and western margins of the Afro-Arabian platform subsequently triggered Late Ordovician glaciation at about 440 Ma when the south polar region lay over North Africa. Early Silurian glaciation in Bolivia and Brazil was followed by a non-glacial episode and renewed Late Devonian glaciation of northern Brazil and Bolivia. The latter event may have resulted from rotation of Gondwana under the South Pole combined with active orogenesis along the western margin of the supercontinent.Hercynian uplift along the western margin of South America caused by the collision and docking of ''Chilinia'' at about 350 Ma (Late Tournasian-Early Visean) was the starting point of a long Late Palaeozoic glacial record that terminated at about 255 Ma (Kungurian-Kazanian) in western Australia. The arrival of large landmasses at high latitude may have been an important precondition for ice growth. Strong Namurian uplift around virtually the entire palaeo-Pacific rim of Gondwana culminated in glaciation of the interior of the supercontinent during the latest Westphalian (c. 300 Ma). There is a clear picture of plate margin compression and propagation of ''far field'' stresses to the plate interior allowing preservation of glacially-influenced strata in newly-rifted intracratonic basins. Many basins show a ''steer's head'' style of infill architecture recording successive phases of subsidence and overstepping of younger strata during basin subsidence and expansion. Exploration for oil and gas in Gondwanan glaciated basins is currently a major stimulus to understanding the relationship between tectonics and sedimentation.Warm Mesozoic palaeoclimates do not rule out the existence of restricted ice covers in the interiors of continental landmasses at high palaeolatitudes (e.g. Siberia, Antarctica) but there is as yet, no direct geological record of their existence. The most likely record of glaciers is contained in Late Jurassic and early Cretaceous strata. In any event, these ice masses are unlikely to have had any marked effect on global sea levels and alternative explanations should perhaps be sought for 4th order, so-called ''glacio-eustatic'' changes in sea level, inferred from Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous strata.The growth of extensive Northern Hemisphere ice sheets in Plio-Pleistocene time (c. 2.5 Ma) was the culmination of a long global climatic deterioration that began sometime after 60 Ma during the late Tertiary. Tectonic uplift of areas such as the Tibetan Plateau and plate tectonic reorganizations have been identified as first-order controls. Initiation of the East Antarctic ice sheet, at about 36 Ma, is the result of the progressive thermal isolation of the continent combined with uplift along the Transantarctic Mountains. In the Northern Hemisphere, the upwarping of extensive passive margin plateaux around the margins of the newly-rifted North Atlantic may have amplified global climatic changes and set the scene for the growth of continental ice sheets after 2.5 Ma. Ice sheet growth and decay was driven by complexly interrelated changes in ocean circulation, Milankovitch orbital forcing and global geochemical cycles. It is arguable whether continental glaciations of the Northern Hemisphere, and the evolution of hominids, would have occurred without the necessary precondition of tectonic uplift.",,,,,,,,,337,12,1,0,33,3,362,,,0012-8252,1872-6828,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1993-09-01,WOS:A1993MC71900001,,

The Regional Aquatics Monitoring Program and its successor, the Joint Canada-Alberta Implementation Plan for Oil Sands Monitoring UOSM), are the primary aquatic programs monitoring this industry. Here we examine sediment data (collected by Ekman grabs) to investigate trends and sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), supplementing these data with sediment core studies. Total PAH (Sigma PAH) concentrations were highest at Shipyard Lake (6038 +/- 2679 ng/g) in the development center and lower at Isadore's Lake (1660 +/- 777 ng/g) to the north; both lakes are in the Athabasca River Valley and lie below the developments. Sigma PAH concentrations were lower (622-930 ng/g) in upland lakes (Kearl, McClelland) located further away from the developments. Sigma PAH concentrations increased at Shipyard Lake (2001-2014) and the Ells River mouth (1998-2014) but decreased in nearshore areas at Kearl Lake (2001-2014) and a Muskeg River (2000-2014) site. Over the longer term, v concentrations increased in Kearl (1934-2012) and Sharkbite (1928-2010) Lakes. Further (200 km) downstream in the Athabasca River delta, Sigma PAH concentrations (1029 +/- 671 ng/g) increased (1999-2014) when %sands were included in the regression model; however, 50 km to the east, concentrations declined (1926-2009) in Lake Athabasca. Ten diagnostic ratios based on anthracene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, indeno[123-cd]pyrene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, dibenzothiophene and retene were examined to infer spatial and temporal trends in PAH sources (e.g., combustion versus petrogenic) and weathering. There was some evidence of increasing contributions of unprocessed oil sands and bitumen dust to Shipyard, Sharkbite, and Isadore's Lakes and increased combustion sources in the Athabasca River delta. Some CCME interim sediment quality guidelines were exceeded, primarily in Shipyard Lake and near presumed natural bitumen sources. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In order to assess the downhole risk in early time and further provide maintenance strategies to optimize well performance, it is necessary to diagnose the source of downhole leakage accurately. This paper presents a pressure-balance-based approach for capturing two types of dynamic annulus pressure behaviors in a gas well with SCP caused by tubing leakage at different well depths. The approach includes models that take into account the influence of temperature and pressure distributions of tubing and annulus fluid, which are used to determine tubing leakage points. In addition, such an approach involves the calculation of maximum annulus pressure at the wellhead in a gas well with SCP under four main cases, representing the effects of the leakage location, bottom hole pressure, annulus liquid level and gas production rate on wellhead pressure. Afterwards, an integrated diagnostic testing system has been developed to monitor the synthetic state of annulus fluid and liquid level parameters, ultimately identifying the source of SCP correctly. In contrast to previous works, leakage diagnostic testing can be performed from an offshore platform, and it meets the requirements of offshore field testing and works without a shut-in condition, which is capable of overcoming limitations of downhole detection. A case study focused on an offshore gas well with SCP is presented to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, and also to demonstrate that leakage diagnosis contributes to the mechanism investigation of SCP, as well as the design improvement of gas wells integrity.",,,,,,,,,15,3,0,0,0,0,18,,,1875-5100,2212-3865,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Petr, Coll Mech & Transportat Engn, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaChina North Vehicle Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China",China North Vehicle Res Inst,,,2018-07-16,WOS:000437088700022,,

Many studies demonstrate the efficacy of dispersants in getting oil off the water surface. Here we show that biodegradation of dispersed oil is prompt and extensive when oil is present at the ppm levels expected from a successful application of dispersants - more than 80% of the hydrocarbons of lightly weathered Alaska North Slope crude oil were degraded in 60 d at 8 degrees C in unamended New Jersey (USA) seawater when the oil was present at 2.5 ppm by volume. The apparent halftime of the biodegradation of the hydrocarbons was 13.8 d in the absence of dispersant, and 11 d in the presence of Corexit 9500 - similar to rates extrapolated from the field in the Deepwater Horizon response.

Black carbon has a significant impact on climate change and pollution in the Arctic. It forms as a result of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels (primarily coal and oil) and biomass or biofuels. It consists of submicron particles and their aggregates and can be transported long distances from their source. Samples were taken by pumping air for 4-6 h through Hahnemule quartz filters at a height of 10 m above sea level in a headwind to prevent exhaust from the smokestack from entering the filters. The black carbon content was subsequently determined in a laboratory with an aethalometer. The backward trajectories of air mass transfer and the transported black carbon particles to the sampling points were calculated by the HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model on the NOAA website at . Studies show low black carbon concentrations (<50 ng/m(3)) along the expedition's route when the air masses came from background regions of the North Atlantic and Arctic. High black carbon concentrations (100-200 ng/m(3) or more) are characteristic of active shipping areas (southwestern Baltic, North Sea) and near ports (e.g., Reykjavik), as well as the arrival of air masses from industrialized areas of Europe in the southeastern Baltic and from oil and gas field areas where gas flaring is carried out (North, Norwegian, and Kara seas).",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,0001-4370,1531-8508,,,,,,,,,,"Russian Acad Sci, Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow 117997, RussiaRussian Acad Sci, Obukhov Inst Atmospher Phys, Moscow 119017, Russia",,,,2020-03-16,WOS:000517281900007,,

This paper describes two recent successful rigless interventions completed in offshore multizone completed gas wells in the Adriatic Sea. A key factor in the success of these remedial treatments has been the application of two different chemical technologies applied to the proppant while it is being pumped into the well.In the first well, production loss was caused by fines migration (fine silt <= 44 microns) into the 40/60 gravel-pack sand, which completely plugged the screens and gravel. An intervention was performed which included sealing the existing completion and then reperforating the premium screen using wireline guns. The interval was then fractured with a tip screenout design and a through-tubing screen was placed across the perforated screen. Critical to this treatment was the use of a surface modifying agent to prevent fines migration and plugging of the gravel pack. Production results have confirmed the correctness of this technical choice.A different problem existed with the second well, which had a frac-pack completion; in this case, a screen failure resulted in formation sand and proppant being produced to the surface. The well was refractured through the hole in the screen and a newly developed resin was applied to the proppant to lock the proppant into place and thus repair the damaged screen without restricting the flow area with a secondary inner string. Unlike conventional resin-coated proppant at low temperatures, this new type of resin does not require confinement pressure and/or the use of chemical flushes to cause the resin to set. Since the intervention, the well has been producing sand-free at very close to the original productivity index (PI).In both cases, these treatments have put back into production wells that in the past could not have been restored to production except through recompletion using a workover rig. This paper will describe the treatment design, well operations performed, materials used. and production performance of each well, comparing each aspect with the case of a conventional recompleted well.",,,,,2006 SPE International Symposium and Exhibition on Formation Damage Control2006 SPE International Symposium and Exhibition on Formation Damage Control,"FEB 15-17, 2006FEB 15-17, 2006",,"Lafayette, LALafayette, LA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1930-1855,,,,,,,,,,,"Halliburton, Global Business & Tech Solut Team, Moscow, Russia",,,,2007-02-01,WOS:000244628000008,,

Therefore, studies were carried out to identify the potential of harnessing ocean energy for electricity generation.

A set of reliable tidal speed and tidal elevation data was therefore generated to determine the types of tides available in Malaysia, the potential areas of installing marine current turbines (MCTs), the total amount of electricity to be generated by MCT, the economical viability and the environmental benefits of using MCT in Malaysia. This paper presents the findings on the studies, encompassing the technical, economical and environmental aspects of installing MCT in Malaysia.

Production techniques such as horizontal drilling and high-volume hydraulic fracturing have led to the recovery of large amounts of natural gas and oil from formations like the Barnett Shale in Texas, the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas, the Bakken Shale in North Dakota, and the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. These resources have created a surplus of natural gas, have provided abundant supplies of oil, and have made the United States essentially energy independent for the first time in decades.Although terms like fracking and Marcellus Shale have become commonplace, few people realize that the development of the technology that enabled the economic production of these resources had its origins in the oil embargos and energy crises of the 1970s. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funded the Eastern Gas Shales Project in the late 1970s and through the 1980s to characterize the resource potential of the extensive, organic-rich Devonian shales in eastern geologic basins, including the Marcellus, and to develop the engineering technology needed to extract natural gas from these rocks economically. Mitchell Energy pursued this into the 1990s, and their persistence eventually achieved the breakthrough needed to produce commercial amounts of gas from low-permeability resources like shale. The application of greatly improved directional drilling technology developed for deep-water offshore platforms, combined with slickwater hydraulic fracturing, allowed Mitchell to use horizontal boreholes with multiple stages of hydraulic fracturing to engineer high-permeability, fracture flow paths into a sufficient volume of reservoir rock to produce significant amounts of gas from the Barnett Shale.Other companies followed suit on other formations, with Range Resources achieving the first commercial horizontal Marcellus Shale well in southwestern Pennsylvania in 2007. Range Resources used data and assessments from the DOE Eastern Gas Shales Project to select target intervals in this well, and their competitors also combed through the DOE archives for relevant reports and data. The development of the Marcellus Shale has been largely in two play areas: southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia, where the shale is a bit thinner, but pipelines are present to receive the gas, and northeastern Pennsylvania, where the shale is thicker, but access to pipelines is not as easy. Estimates of recoverable gas from the Marcellus and other gas shales run to many hundreds of trillions of cubic feet, which should supply the United States with natural gas for decades. Shale gas has completely changed thinking about world fossil energy supplies.The development of natural gas from the Marcellus and other shales has not been without controversy. Antifracking activists have made claims that shale gas development in general, and hydraulic fracturing in particular, contributes to climate change and threatens groundwater resources, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and human health. Based on these claims, the states of New York and Maryland have banned high-volume hydraulic fracturing on the Marcellus Shale, although it is permitted in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The actual environmental impacts are neither as extensive nor as persistent as some activists believe, but there certainly are issues. Shale gas development can affect air quality, water resources, landscapes, and ecosystems.Most of the environmental problems stem from the boom-and-bust nature of the oil and gas business. In their hurry to capitalize on this new resource, exploration and production companies often hired many inexperienced people to install a large number of wells as quickly as possible, resulting in significant impacts. The boom led to an oversupply of gas, causing a drop in gas prices and a slowing of drilling activities. When the bust came, only the most experienced drilling crews were retained, but the damage done during the earlier boom cycle left large numbers of people permanently opposed to fracking.Research is attempting to reduce the uncertainties related to the environmental impacts of shale gas development. Federal interagency studies have been investigating air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, impacts to water availability and water quality, subsurface migration of gas and liquids, wellbore integrity, geochemistry of produced fluids, impacts to ecosystems, and exposure routes and possible impacts to human health. Many university and research foundation studies are working along similar lines, and efforts are being made to coordinate, collaborate, and reduce duplication of efforts. Research is also being focused on finding new uses for the abundant natural gas being produced from shale. Two suggested utilization technologies are generating electricity and use as a transportation fuel.The successful development of the Marcellus Shale achieves the long-sought goal of greater energy independence for the United States. It also contributes to an all-of-the above energy strategy that utilizes existing resources while continuing to develop new ones.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0072-1077,,978-0-8137-2527-7,,,,,,,,,"US DOE, Natl Energy Technol Lab, Morgantown, WV 26507 USA",,,,2017-01-01,WOS:000540460300002,,

Here we present a reconnaissance analysis of groundwater quality in the Eagle Ford region of southern Texas. These data reveal two distinct sample populations that are differentiable by bromide/chloride ratios. Elevated levels of fluoride, nitrate, sulfate, various metal ions, and the detection of exotic volatile organic compounds highlight a high bromide group of samples, which is geographically clustered, while encompassing multiple hydrogeological strata. Samples with bromide/chloride ratios representative of connate water displayed elevated levels of total organic carbon, while revealing the detection of alcohols and chlorinated compounds. These findings suggest that groundwater quality in the Western Gulf Basin is, for the most part, controlled by a series of natural processes; however, there is also evidence of episodic contamination events potentially attributed to unconventional oil and gas development or other anthropogenic activities. Collectively, this characterization of natural groundwater constituents and exogenous compounds will guide targeted remediation efforts and provides insight for agricultural entities, industrial operators, and rural communities that rely on groundwater in southern Texas.

The change in stress state with depletion induces a change in permeability both in the far-field and the near wellbore region. Modeling the depletion induced permeability alteration is crucial in forecasting hydrocarbon production and designing a drilling strategy. Porosity-based permeability models are typically used in which the permeability changes are assumed to be isotropic. However, most rocks are anisotropic, and the stress changes due to depletion and drilling a well are also anisotropic. As an example, we compared isotropic and anisotropic permeability predictions around a hypothetical well drilled in the Tor formation in Valhall field in the North Sea. The results show that isotropic permeability models tend to underestimate the degree of permeability reduction in the near-wellbore region, but even when anisotropy is considered, the permeability in the radial direction still only decreases by about 10%.

The petroleum industry has, therefore, been trying to maximize the recovery from existing and mature oil fields, mainly through enhanced oil recovery (EOR), as well as to extend exploration and production activities to deeper offshore areas and harsher environments such as the Arctic. Offshore reservoirs generally exhibit poor recovery factors due to several challenges and limitations encountered in offshore areas. One of the most critical limiting factors in offshore developments is the lack of sufficient rock and fluid data from the full extent of the reservoir due to the typically limited number of wells drilled in these reservoirs, particularly in the initial stages of field development. This results in high uncertainties in reservoir characterization, hinders the selection of appropriate production techniques and EOR methods, and increases the failure risk of offshore development plans. The logical approach to overcoming such issues starts with building a solid basis of reservoir characterization by trying to maximize the value of rock and fluid data through planning the extraction of sufficient samples from the reservoir, optimizing the experimental procedures, and using appropriate and reliable property-predictive methods where required. This paper is an effort to review the main challenges of offshore developments as well as the main reservoir rock and fluid characterization methods, tests, and predictive tools to provide a comprehensive picture of what can help decision-making and achievement of more reliable offshore reservoir descriptions.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,1091-028X,1934-0508,,,,,,,,,,"Mem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada",,,,2020-01-10,WOS:000505042500006,,

Although a controversial proposition, oil's appearance on the sea floor following the 2010 Macondo 252 spill in the Gulf of Mexico and its large unaccountable volume has raised awareness of possible alternative explanations. Drag-down by settling particles is one known process. Another possible cause is heavy residue sinking due to density increase that follows the evaporation of the light constituents from the mixture. The study outcome impacts the field of oil spill modeling because confirmed mechanism-based process algorithms are required in the oil fate models. Theoretical and experimental studies on the proof of concept for the evaporation/sinking [EVAPO-SINK] process were undertaken using binary chemical mixtures representing model oils. Laboratory macrocosm-scale experiments with surface spills were performed and a theoretical, binary-component mathematical model was developed. Direct visual observations and physical/chemical measurements during both evaporation to air and heavy droplet sinking in the water column confirmed the process. Data obtained on oil component and bulk density concentrations tracked the time-series oil constituent chemodynamics within the slick and droplets. At the critical density the slick exceeded neutral buoyancy in water, after which a droplet formed underneath, broke away from the slick, and settled to the bottom. The drop was collected and physical/chemical measurements performed. Independent of the initial slick composition, the measured critical densities were 1.04 g/mL (+/- 0.006) for fresh water and 1.07 for seawater. Dependent on initial composition, evaporation time to droplet formation varied from 200 to 2400 s. Data yielded evaporation rate kinetics required in the theoretical model. This light component mass transport coefficient ranged from 120 to 300 cm/h. The model correctly mimicked slick and droplet composition chemodynamic behavior patterns and density and drop-time measurements.

Coastal wetlands are globally important carbon sinks, yet the effects of shifts in mangrove cover on organic-carbon (OC) storage remains uncertain. We experimentally maintained black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) or marsh vegetation in patches (n = 1,120, 3 x 3 m) along a gradient in mangrove cover (0-100%) within coastal wetland plots (n = 10, 24 x 42 m) and measured changes in OC stocks and fluxes. Within patches, above and belowground biomass (OC) was 1,630% and 61% greater for mangroves than for recolonized marshes, and soil OC was 30% greater beneath mangrove than marsh vegetation. At the plot scale, above and belowground biomass increased linearly with mangrove cover but soil OC was highly variable and unrelated to mangrove cover. Root ingrowth was not different in mangrove or marsh patches, nor did it change with mangrove cover. After 11 months, surface OC accretion was negatively related to plot-scale mangrove cover following a high-wrack deposition period. However, after 22 months, accretion was 54% higher in mangrove patches, and there was no relationship to plot-scale mangrove cover. Marsh (Batis maritima) leaf and root litter had 1,000% and 35% faster breakdown rates (k) than mangrove (A. germinans) leaf and root litter. Soil temperatures beneath mangroves were 1.4 degrees C lower, decreasing aboveground k of fast- (cellulose) and slow-decomposing (wood) standard substrates. Wood k in shallow soil (0-15 cm) was higher in mangrove than marsh patches, but vegetation identity did not impact k in deeper soil (15-30 cm). We found that mangrove cover enhanced OC storage by increasing biomass, creating more recalcitrant organic matter and reducing k on the soil surface by altering microclimate, despite increasing wood k belowground and decreasing allochthonous OC subsidies. Our results illustrate the importance of mangroves in maintaining coastal OC storage, but also indicate that the impacts of vegetation change on OC storage may vary based on ecosystem conditions, organic-matter sources, and the relative spatiotemporal scales of mangrove vegetation change.",,,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,25,0,35,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USAFlorida Int Univ, Southeast Environm Res Ctr, Miami, FL 33199 USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, POB 1675, Galveston, TX 77553 USAUniv Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USATianjin Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Tianjin Key Lab Anim & Plant Resistance, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R ChinaTexas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, College Stn, TX 77843 USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Life Sci, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA",,,,2020-03-03,WOS:000513811400005,31646613,

Four trial sites also incorporated three different post-harvest organic matter removal treatments. All sites were sampled in early 2002 and 2003. Fertilisation significantly increased the nitrogen content and decreased the carbon:nitrogen ratio of the litter fall. Fertilisation significantly increased the mass of the FH layer in the treatment plots, moisture content in the FH layer, the concentration of nitrogen in the FH layer and the pool of carbon and nitrogen stored in the FH layer. Fertilisation significantly increased the nitrogen concentration of the mineral soil, and decreased the mineral soil carbon:nitrogen ratio and pH. Several significant site x fertilisation interaction terms indicated that variations in the fertilisation regimes and site characteristics substantially influenced the effects of fertilisation. Fertilisation did not significantly decrease the relative differences between the organic matter removal treatments. The significant differences in the litter fall, FH layer and mineral soil characteristics strongly suggest that nitrogenous fertilisation has the capacity to significantly alter the forest floor environment, and may be able to increase carbon storage over the life of the rotation.

These climatic shifts have been associated with major rearrangements in the deep ocean circulation and stratification, which have likely played an important role in the observed atmospheric carbon dioxide swings by affecting the partitioning of carbon between the atmosphere and the ocean. The mechanisms by which the deep ocean circulation changed, however, are still unclear and represent a major challenge to our understanding of glacial climates. This study shows that various inferred changes in the deep ocean circulation and stratification between glacial and interglacial climates can be interpreted as a direct consequence of atmospheric temperature differences. Colder atmospheric temperatures lead to increased sea ice cover and formation rate around Antarctica. The associated enhanced brine rejection leads to a strongly increased deep ocean stratification, consistent with high abyssal salinities inferred for the last glacial maximum. The increased stratification goes together with a weakening and shoaling of the interhemispheric overturning circulation, again consistent with proxy evidence for the last glacial. The shallower interhemispheric overturning circulation makes room for slowly moving water of Antarctic origin, which explains the observed middepth radiocarbon age maximum and may play an important role in ocean carbon storage.",,,,,,,,,63,2,0,0,5,0,69,,,0027-8424,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, 5734 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",,,,2017-01-18,WOS:000391093700024,27994158,
J,,,,,,,,,"Jay, David",,Secular Changes in Pacific Tides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 15 2009,2009,"Intellectual Merit: Global sea level (GSL) rise is well documented. However, changes in extreme Higher high water (HHW), including the tidal contribution, are just as relevant as GSL rise. Analysis of tidal records shows that the diurnal and semi-diurnal amplitudes are both growing at 2.2% per hundred years in the NE Pacific (between 18 to 60ºN). The mean increase in total tidal amplitude (0.59 mm per year) is less than GSL rise (1.7 mm per year). However, spatially averaged mean sea level (MSL) rise is small in the NE Pacific, so tidal evolution plays a major role in changes in HHW. The spatial pattern of tidal evolution suggests the influence of large-scale processes, and seems to exclude mechanisms with strong frequency dependence. The importance of the possible impacts and the large-scale nature of the changes demand an analysis that encompasses multiple tidal amphidromes. This will allow examination of processes in areas with both increasing and decreasing tidal amplitudes, and facilitate investigation of causes. Specifically, we will evaluate from data changes in tidal amplitudes for the entire Pacific Ocean and determine likely causes through numerical modeling. The investigators will carry out the following tasks: 1) Methods, data sources and preliminary analyses: What is the most efficient method to extract secular trends (and possible changes in trends) from time series of the constituent complex amplitude? There are few stations with length of record (LOR) greater than 50 years, and roughly 9 and 18.6 year variations in tidal properties do not exactly follow astronomical forcing, complicating analysis. Optimizing analysis methods to make the best use of scarce data is vital. A harmonic method of constituent extraction from both the tidal data and tidal potential, followed by a regression analysis of the tidal admittance, will be used in an analysis that covers all major diurnal and semidiurnal constituents. Complex demodulation will be used to analyze coherent and incoherent energy in several tidal bands at selected island and coastal stations. 2) Space-time patterns: How do tidal properties vary in space and time? We will objectively map (using empirical orthogonal functions or EOF) spatial patterns of tidal evolution and deter-mine whether tidal amplitude changes show acceleration analogous to GSL rise. Some stations also exhibit apparent, large-amplitude climate responses, e.g. to ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) events, that are easy to detect. Others show annual cycles of admittance. These responses are important clues regarding causation of secular trends. 3) Causation: What are the causes of secular changes in tidal amplitudes? Barotropic and three-dimensional models will be used to test whether the observed large-scale changes could be caused by: a) changes in background vorticity affecting the tides due to changes in winds, or b) interactions with changing ocean stratification resulting in a time-varying balance of baroclinic and barotropic tidal energy. We will also investigate the role of changing shelf stratification in altering the interaction of coastal trapped waves, and internal and surface tides, because this is likely a significant factor causing spatial variations on top of the amphidromic-scale changes. 4) Synthesis: What are the actual mechanisms causing tides to evolve rapidly? Conceptual in-sights from Task 3 must be combined with analysis results from Tasks 1 and 2 to determine this. Broader Impacts: Increasing tidal amplitudes may impact ocean mixing, nutrient supply, primary production, fisheries, coastal infrastructure, and coastal erosion. Changing patterns of tidal properties may also be a significant, but heretofore unrecognized, symptom of global climate change.

There is broad agreement among the results from these methods: carbon sinks are currently found in tropical, temperate and boreal forests as well as the ocean.4 However, on a global scale the effect of the terrestrial sinks (absorbing 2-3 billion tonnes of carbon per year) is largely offset by deforestation in the tropics (losing 1-2 billion tonnes of carbon per year).5 The Kyoto Protocol provides incentives for the establishment of sinks.

Similar to super-martensitic stainless steels used in the oil and gas industry, a common failure sequence in marine environments represents pitting and subsequent hydrogen assisted stress corrosion cracking (HASCC). For addressing such phenomena quantitively, as required for respective lifetime assessments of MLG components and systems, the tolerance of such materials dependent on the absorbed hydrogen concentration must be evaluated quantitatively. However, there is a lack of such valuable materials data, as well as of the fractographic behavior dependent on the hydrogen concentration that might be absorbed during HASCC. To provide an improved understanding of the hydrogen dependent mechanical and fractographic behavior, samples of the legacy AISI 4340 and the new S10500 MLG steels have electrochemically been hydrogen-saturated and subjected to tensile testing. In contrast to a previous study, this contribution for the first time focuses on materials that have been salvaged from real service used landing gear components. In this study, it has been demonstrated that the service-applied S10500 steel has not only a higher strength, but also an improved ductility in comparison to the legacy AISI 4340 steel after similar service durations that provides a higher tolerance against hydrogen concentrations that might be absorbed during potential pitting and HASCC in marine environments. In addition, it has been found that the absorbed hydrogen concentration significantly affects the fracture behavior. Interestingly, hardening of the hydrogen charged low-alloyed AISI 4340 steel changes the fracture topography from trans-toward intergranular, while hardening of the S10500 steel turned the fracture topography from inter-to transgranular at respectively high hydrogen concentrations.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,0010-9312,1938-159X,,,,,,,,,,"BAM Fed Inst Mat Res & Testing, Unter Eichen 87, D-12205 Berlin, GermanyAir Force Life Cycle Management Ctr, Robins AFB, GeorgiaUS Air Force Acad, Ctr Aircraft Struct Lifetime Extens CAStLE, Denver, CO USA",Air Force Life Cycle Management Ctr,,,2019-05-20,WOS:000466978600009,,

Hence, the safety and reliability of SPSs have become a major concern. To guarantee the high integrity of SPSs, investment should be made in inspection and monitoring of SPSs (IMSPSs) in order to prevent failures of the subsea equipment, as much as possible. This paper reviews the current progress in technologies for IMSPSs using non-destructive testing (NDT). The basic principles and features of four common NDT techniques used for IMSPSs are reviewed. Based on these NDT techniques, the current development of IMSPSs, as well as the latest advanced technologies, is then discussed. Furthermore, capabilities and limitations of IMSPSs are discussed.

The nature of a well plugging and abandonment (Well P&A) run is usually conducted in a manner such that the lowest-cost contractor is engaged to plug several wells tapping the same reservoir. Thus, this makes it an ideal case study for incorporating failures based on common causes. The heavy use of operators during a cementing job also provides the case for analysis of human error in such tasks. One proposed method to analyse the above-mentioned is the use of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) to achieve the following objectives (1) to capture better estimates of a well PA event by incorporating dependencies, and meet regulatory requirements by authorities; and (2) to use the same model to provide long term monitoring of a group of wells linked by common dependencies. This model has not only captured the dependencies of multiple variables, but also projected it in a dynamic manner to provide a risk profile for the next decade where well integrity failure is likely to happen.

Such records can test the synchronicity and extent of ice-age climatic events and define how Arctic landscapes respond to rapid climate changes. Here we describe the stratigraphy and sedimentology of a yedoma deposit in Arctic Alaska (the Carter Section) dating to between 37,000 and 9000 calibrated radiocarbon years BP (37-9 ka) and containing detailed records of loess and sand-sheet sedimentation, soil development, carbon storage, and permafrost dynamics. Alternation between sand-sheet and loess deposition provides a proxy for the extent and activity of the Ikpikpuk Sand Sea (ISS), a large dune field located immediately upwind. Warm, moist interstadial times (ca. 37, 36.3-32.5, and 15-13 ka) triggered floodplain aggradation, permafrost thaw, reduced loess deposition, increased vegetation cover, and rapid soil development accompanied by enhanced carbon storage. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ca. 28-18 ka), rapid loess deposition took place on a landscape where vegetation was sparse and non-woody. The most intense aeolian activity occurred after the LGM between ca. 18 and 151 a when sand sheets fringing the ISS expanded over the site, possibly in response to increasingly droughty conditions as summers warmed and active layers deepened. With the exception of this lagged LGM response, the record of aeolian activity at the Carter Section correlates with other paleoenvironmental records from unglaciated Siberia and Alaska. Overall, rapid shifts in geomorphology, soils, vegetation, and permafrost portray an ice-age landscape where, in contrast to the Holocene, environmental change was chronic and dominated by aeolian processes.

To probe the reasons behind this slow pace of development, an emergy evaluation and an economic analysis were conducted on the Jiangxia Tidal Power Station (JTPS), which has an installed capacity of 4.1 MW. The JTPS is the largest tidal power station in China and the fourth largest in the world. The evaluation results exhibited a total power conversion system emergy use of 1.59E+19 sej to generate 5.90E+13 J of electricity in 2014. Tidal energy only accounts for 16.54% of the total energy budget. The rest of the resources were invested to capture and convert tidal energy to electricity, thereby generating a relatively low efficiency or high transformity of 2.69E+05 sej/J. The results revealed a JTPS emergy loading ratio (ELR) and energy sustainability index (ESI) of 3.72 and 0.41, respectively, which indicates poorer environmental performance compared to other renewable energy power plants, with the exception of photovoltaic power. In addition, the economic analysis revealed a JTPS power generation cost of 2.41 CNY/kWh, which is even higher than that of concentrating solar power (CSP). The JTPS is less competitive because tidal energy has a lower quality and is more decentralized when generating electricity compared to other renewable resources. This inefficiency was exacerbated in the JTPS case due to the original multipurpose design and consequential poor site selection with respect to tidal electricity generation. These results further highlight the importance of dam site selection and the tidal range, as they are critical for the improvement of the tidal power generation environmental performance. More importantly, R&D is essential to promote the development of this technology and to ultimately utilize abundant tidal resources in an efficient and sustainable way. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Machine learning models were then used to estimate salinization-induced changes in CH4 fluxes and plant productivity. We observed dynamic CH4 flux-driver relationships across the salinization disturbance event, where temperature connections strengthened, and productivity connections dampened during salinization. Annual gross ecosystem productivity reduced by 64% during peak salinization, whereas annual CH4 emissions only reduced by 10%, suggesting that other CH4 substrate sources compensated for reductions in recent photosynthate.

The potential, upper bound to C storage is difficult to approximate in the field because it requires studying old-growth forests, of which few remain. In this paper, we put an upper bound (or limit) on C storage in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United States using field data from old-growth forests, which are near steady-state conditions. Specifically, the goals of this study were: (1) to approximate the upper bounds of C storage in the PNW by estimating total ecosystem carbon (TEC) stores of 43 old-growth forest stands in five distinct biogeoclimatic provinces and (2) to compare these TEC storage estimates with those from other biomes, globally. Finally, we suggest that the upper bounds of C storage in forests of the PNW are higher than current estimates of C stores, presumably due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic disturbances, which indicates a potentially substantial and economically significant role of C sequestration in the region. Results showed that coastal Oregon stands stored, on average, 1127 Mg C/ha, which was the highest for the study area, while stands in eastern Oregon stored the least, 195 Mg C/ha. In general, coastal Oregon stands stored 307 Mg C/ha more than coastal Washington stands. Similarly, the Oregon Cascades stands stored 75 Mg C/ha more, on average, than the Washington Cascades stands. A simple, area-weighted average TEC storage to I m soil depth (TEC,,,) for the PNW was 671 Mg C/ha. When soil was included only to 50 cm (TEC(50)), the area-weighted average was 640 Mg C/ha. Subtracting estimates of current forest C storage from the potential, upper bound of C storage in this study, a maximum of 338 Mg C/ha (TEC(100)) could be stored in PNW forests in addition to current stores.",,,,,,,,,187,10,0,0,147,0,219,,,1051-0761,,,,,,,,,,,"Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USAUniv Washington, Coll Forest Resources, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,,,2002-10-01,WOS:000179198600006,,

These nitrogen oxides have significant effects on the partitioning and cycling of reactive radicals such as halogens and HOx (OH + HO2). However, little is known about the impacts of local anthropogenic NOx emission sources on gas-phase halogen chemistry in the Arctic, and this is important because these emissions can induce large variability in ambient NOx and thus local chemistry. In this study, a zero-dimensional photochemical kinetics model was used to investigate the influence of NOx on the unique springtime halogen and HOx chemistry in the Arctic. Trace gas measurements obtained during the 2009 OASIS (Ocean - Atmosphere - Sea Ice - Snowpack) field campaign at Barrow, AK were used to constrain many model inputs. We find that elevated NOx significantly impedes gas-phase halogen radical-based depletion of ozone, through the production of a variety of reservoir species, including HNO3, HO2NO2, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), BrNO2, ClNO2 and reductions in BrO and HOBr. The effective removal of BrO by anthropogenic NOx was directly observed from measurements conducted near Prudhoe Bay, AK during the 2012 Bromine, Ozone, and Mercury Experiment (BROMEX). Thus, while changes in snow-covered sea ice attributable to climate change may alter the availability of molecular halogens for ozone and Hg depletion, predicting the impact of climate change on polar atmospheric chemistry is complex and must take into account the simultaneous impact of changes in the distribution and intensity of anthropogenic combustion sources.

Continuation of the use of fossil fuels is set to face multiple challenges: depletion of fossil fuel reserves, global warming and other environmental concerns, geopolitical and military conflicts and of late, continued and significant fuel price rise. These problems indicate an unsustainable situation. Renewable energy is the solution to the growing energy challenges. Renewable energy resources such as solar, wind, biomass, and wave and tidal energy, are abundant, inexhaustible and environmentally friendly. This article provides an overview of the current and projected energy scene. Five countries, that presently have a significant impact on global energy situation, have been studied in this work. These include China, India, Russia, UK and USA. Together the present energy budget of these countries is roughly half that of the globe. Four of the above five countries that are discussed in this work-China, India, UK and USA are all net importers of energy and are heavily dependent on imports of fuel to sustain their energy demands. Their respective local oil reserves will only last 9, 6, 7 and 4 years, respectively. China, the emerging economy in the world, is however making exemplary development in renewable energy-in 2004 renewable energy in China grew by 25% against 7-9% growth in electricity demand. While in the same year, wind energy in China saw a growth of 35%. China is also leading the global solar thermal market as it has already installed solar collectors over 65 million square meters, accounting for more than 40% of the world's total collector area. This article quantifies the period of exhaustion of the current major energy sources, i.e. coal, oil, gas and nuclear fissile material. Projected demand for energy is also presented and a feasibility of switch over to renewable energy is discussed. The article also presents the size of respective wind- and solar farms that would be required for each of the five countries under discussion to meet their year 2020 energy demands. It has been found that to meet 50% of the total energy demands the proposed area for collection of solar and wind energy by means of ultra-large scale farms in fact will occupy a mere fraction of the available land and near-offshore area for the respective countries, e.g. a solar PV electricity farm of 61 km(2) for China represents 0.005% of the Gobi desert. Likewise, the 26 and 36 km(2) PV farm area, respectively, required for India and the US represents 0.01% and 0.014% land area of Rajasthan and Baja deserts. The above areas required for the farms may be further split to form a cluster of smaller energy farms. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The model was assessed in its ability to determine the rate of thickness loss for carbon-steel pipework subjected to a CO2-containing erosion-corrosion environment, reviewing to what extent the prediction agrees with inspection data. The investigation considers whether the developed tool could have predicted pipework failures on the facility, comparing it with the degradation rate calculated from a leak that occurred within the past 2 years. The program of experiments set out to create a means of prediction with the material-loss data from submerged-impinging-jet tests over a range of conditions replicating those within the line. Information pertaining to the temperature, production rate, and sand loading was collated for the offshore facility. These data were used along with mass-loss results to predict the degradation rate on the asset as a function of time over a 5-year period. This in turn was used to predict the total thickness loss of the pipework wall as a function of time. Consideration was also given to the current use of inhibition (10 ppm Inhibitor A) as well as the predicted thickness losses as a function of time had a candidate inhibitor been used instead (50 ppm Inhibitor B). Limitations of the model are presented, along with suggestions for ways to develop the model further.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,0,15,,,1086-055X,1930-0220,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Leeds, Sch Mech Engn, Inst Engn Thermofluids Surfaces & Interfaces, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, EnglandUniv Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, EnglandShell UK Ltd, London, England",,,,2014-08-27,WOS:000339550700009,,

BC has multiple major pipeline transmission systems (e.g., Trans Mountain pipeline, Spectra Energy and Pacific Northern Gas), and at least six major oil and gas pipelines are planned for construction over the next decade [1]. Large pipeline projects like these that span hundreds of kilometres can involve multiple jurisdictions (federal, provincial or joint) and require considerable regulatory planning. Once a pipeline project is approved through an environmental assessment (EA) process, it must still undergo rigorous environmental review as part of regulatory permitting.This paper provides an overview of oil and gas environmental regulatory processes in BC, with a focus on the role and process of the BC Oil and Gas Commission (BC OGC) as it pertains to environmental permitting requirements (i.e., legislation and regulation) for pipeline projects. Current regulatory application and review processes have been developed for small projects. This creates several unique considerations for major pipeline project applications. Among these is how best to coordinate the permit applications required for environmental management and protection of the diverse resource features of interest to BC regulatory agencies (e.g., culturally modified trees, riparian management areas, wildlife tree retention areas and old growth management areas).This paper also highlights the need for an integrated multi-disciplinary approach and discusses lessons learned related to strategic planning of permit applications.

Very high levels (10-28%) of organic carbon within the heavily oiled sediments are clearly distinguished from those in pristine sediments (<3%). Dissolved organic carbon in contaminated pore waters, ranging up to hundreds of mg/kg, are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those at pristine sites. Heavily oiled sediments are characterized by very high sulfide concentrations (up to 80 mg/kg) and abundance of sulfate reducing bacteria.

In CO2 generation by CaCO3 precipitation, theta varies from a fraction of 0.44 to 0.79, increasing with decreasing temperature (25 to 5 degrees C), increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration (195-375 ppmv), and increasing CaCO3 precipitated mass (up to 45% of the initial DIC concentration in surface water). Primary production and net storage of organic carbon counteracts the CO2 production by carbonate precipitation and it results in lower CO2 emissions from the surface layer. When atmospheric CO2 increases due to the ocean-to-atmosphere flux rather than remaining constant, the amount of CO2 transferred is a non-linear function of the surface layer thickness because of the back-pressure of the rising atmospheric CO2. For a surface ocean layer approximated by a 50-m-thick euphotic zone that receives input of inorganic and organic carbon from land, the calculated CO2 flux to the atmosphere is a function of the CaCO3 and C-org net storage rates. In general, the carbonate storage rate has been greater than that of organic carbon. The CO2 flux near the Last Glacial Maximum is 17 to 7x10(12) mol/yr (0.2-0.08 Gt C/yr), reflecting the range of organic carbon storage rates in sediments, and for pre-industrial time it is 38-42x10(12) mol/yr (0.46-0.50 Gt C/yr). Within the imbalanced global carbon cycle, our estimates indicate that prior to anthropogenic emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere the land organic reservoir was gaining carbon and the surface ocean was losing carbon, calcium, and total alkalinity owing to the CaCO3 storage and consequent emission of CO2. These results are in agreement with the conclusions of a number of other investigators. As the CO2 uptake in mineral weathering is a major flux in the global carbon cycle, the CO2 weathering pathway that originates in the CO2 produced by remineralization of soil humus rather than by direct uptake from the atmosphere may reduce the relatively large imbalances of the atmosphere and land organic reservoir at 10(2)-10(4)-year time scales.",,,,,,,,,53,13,0,0,29,0,66,,,1380-6165,1573-1421,,,,,,,,,,"Northwestern Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USAUniv Hawaii, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,,,2005-12-01,WOS:000233733200001,,

Soil samples were collected from 16 study sites where the surface soil was deposited in early stage (before 1970s) or recently years. Soil properties, SMB and bacterial community structure were measured. Relationship between soil properties and bacterial community compositions was simultaneously evaluated by redundancy analysis (RDA). The results indicated that there were significant differences in soil texture and other soil properties between the early sedimentary soil samples and the recently sedimentary soil samples. As a representative for SMB, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) had a significant increase from 686 to 1324 mu g C/g soil. Bacterial community structure had an obvious change, and Shannon-Weiner diversity index had a significant increase from 2.39 to 2.92. Although causes for these changes could be multiple, these 50,000 dams would be the root causes as they decreased the grain-sizes of sediment, which affected soil properties, discharged into Dongting Lake.

The hydrocarbon degradation rate of P. aeruginosa AKS1 in oil only amended sediment was 10.75 +/- 0.65 mu g CO2-Cg(-1) sediment day(-1) which was similar to degradation rate in sediments with no oil. In presence of both inorganic N & P, the degradation rate increased to 47.22 +/- 1.32 mu g CO2-C g(-1) sediment day(-1). The half-saturation constant (K-s) and maximum degradation rate (V-max) for P. aeruginosa AKS1 under increasing N and saturating P concentration were 13.57 +/- 0.53 mu g N g(-1) sediment and 3936 +/- 1.42 mu g CO2-C g(-1) sediment day(-1) respectively. The corresponding values at increasing P and a constant N concentration were 1.60 +/- 0.13 mu g P g(-1) sediment and 43.90 +/- 1.03 mu g CO2-C g(-1) sediment day(-1) respectively. Similarly the degradation rate of Bacillus sp. AKS2 in sediments amended with both inorganic nutrients N & P was seven fold higher than the rates in oil only or nutrient only treated sediments. The K-s and V-max estimates of Bacillus sp. AKS2 under increasing N and saturating P concentration were 9.96 +/- 1.25 mu g N g(-1) sediment and 59.96 +/- 7.56 mu g CO2-C g(-1) sediment day(-1) respectively. The corresponding values for P at saturating N concentration were 0.46 +/- 0.24 mu g P g(-1) sediment and 63.63 +/- 3.54 mu g CO2-C g(-1) sediment day(-1) respectively. The rates of CO2 production by both isolates were further stimulated when oil concentration was increased above 12.5 mg g(-1) sediment. However, oil degradation activity declined at oil concentration above 40 mg g(-1) sediment when treated with constant nutrient: oil ratio. Both isolates exhibited alkane hydroxylase activity but aromatic degrading catechol 1, 2-dioxygenase and catechol 2, 3-dioxygenase activities were shown by P. aeruginosa AKS1 only.

The objective of this article is to assess the performance of intermodal chains versus trucking in terms of costs, times, and externalities when the selected fleet for Short Sea Shipping is made up of optimal container vessels operating with different propulsion plants and fuels in compliance with emission control area requirements. This is, Tier III- four-stroke diesel engine with marine gas oil, a Tier III- four-stroke diesel engine Tier III with scrubber and heavy fuel oil, and a four-stroke dual engine operating with liquefied natural gas. To this aim, a mathematical model, which is able to provide optimized technical and operative features of the vessels, is modified and solved for an intermodal chain between Spain and France through the Atlantic coast. This study shows that dual liquefied natural gas engines prove to be not only the most sustainable solution but also the most suitable in terms of costs, as long as the difference in price between liquefied natural gas and petroleum fuels is equal to the base case or within a modification range of 20%.

This means that predictions over the characteristics on which renewable energies depend are necessary, in order to know the amount of energy that will be obtained at any time. The second topic tackled in this thesis is related to the basic parameters that influence in different marine activities and airports, whose knowledge is necessary to develop a proper facilities management in these environments. Within this work, a study of the state-of-the-art Machine Learning have been performed to solve the problems associated with the topics above-mentioned, and several contributions have been proposed: One of the pillars of this work is focused on the estimation of the most important parameters in the exploitation of renewable resources. The second contribution of this thesis is related to feature selection problems. The proposed methodologies are applied to multiple problems: the prediction of $H_s$, relevant for marine energy applications and marine activities, the estimation of WPREs, undesirable variations in the electric power produced by a wind farm, the prediction of global solar radiation in areas from Spain and Australia, really important in terms of solar energy, and the prediction of low-visibility events at airports. All of these practical issues are developed with the consequent previous data analysis, normally, in terms of meteorological variables.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-11-23,PPRN:19366561,,

In addition to the karst reservoir occurred in the weathering crust, the non-karst dolomite reservoir which distributed widely hasn' t got enough attention for a long time. In recent years, with the progress of the deep and ultra deep exploration technology, the non-karst dolomite has been successively awarded hydrocarbon discoveries, but its prediction difficulty is far more than the moving target of rimmed platform reefs. In order to reveal the macro-development distribution of the non-karst dolomite reservoir fatherly, this paper focus on the study of high-precision lithofacies paleogeography and depositional filling model of Majiagou Formation of Ordovician, Ordos Basin, and Leikoupo Formation of Triassic, Sichuan Basin. The results showed that: the epicontinental platform located in stable intrarcraton basin and generally formed in the low latitude dry climate during the geological greenhouse period. The tidal platform distributed widely associated with salt lake is the hallmark characteristics of the epeiric sea. Its micro environment can be further divided into the mud rich dolomite supratidal flat, dolomite upper intertidal flat, upper intertidal microbial mats, lower intertidal sheet tidal-front beach, upper subtidal calcitedolomite lagoon, lower subtidal gypseous dolomite lagoon. Although intracraton epeiric platform is a relatively static environment, the sedimentary formation is not a homogeneous geologic material. Because the sea-level changes lead to sedimentary facies belt migrate frequently in such a flat intracraton geomorphology, the supratidal facies, intertidal facies and subtidal facies interact and stack frequently. This reciprocating migration process, the flat shaped of grain/particle/microbial dolomite developed broadly, which restricted by lagoon, paleo-uplift or tidal flat island. The sequence of epeiric facies is a typical upward shallowing structure, including two main depositional filling patterns, such as the tidal flat progradation wedge and mosaic of tidal flat islands. The sheet dolomite lens body formed by these two kinds of patterns, usually extending more than 100km, even across the whole epeiric platform, can be contrast in the sequence structure and the thickness, and is a favorable exploration target that can be comparable to the reef-bank complexes of the platform margin.",,,,,,,,,5,14,0,0,0,0,18,,,1000-0569,2095-8927,,,,,,,,,,"Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Petr, Coll Geosci, Beijing 102249, Peoples R ChinaSinopec Southwest Branch, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China",Sinopec Southwest Branch,,,2017-06-15,WOS:000402585200017,,

Under the current low oil prices though, even maintaining basic oil production is challenging. A techno-economic assessment is made of the Claymore oil field with the PSS IV simulator, focusing on uncertainty and investment risk. For a stochastic oil price ranging between 10 and 70 (sic)/bbl, a stochastic CO2 revenue of -10 to 70 (sic)/t and stochastic reservoir parameters, an average NPV of almost 500 M(sic) is obtained with a 73% chance on a positive NPV if the investment is made. Disregarding uncertainty relating to the underground by fixing the stochastic reservoir parameters, leads remarkably, but also erroneously, to a lower average NPV. Results also show that geological uncertainty is an important factor for determining the economic threshold level of an EOR project, and a proper assessment of the real uncertainties can make the difference between profit and loss. In case of assuming a fixed CO2 revenue at 30 (sic)/t, the probability of implementing EOR becomes higher, but the average NPV and project success rate are significantly lower, at 300 M(sic) and 63% respectively. This demonstrates that a fixed CO2 tax is not a generic CGS enabling solution. It not well-weighted, it can hamper the deployment of certain technologies. A phase of CO2 geological storage (CGS) after oil production becomes economically interesting from a CO2 revenue of 17(sic)/t. If such a price level can be guaranteed, then continuation of CO2 injection can reduce investment risk for both the EOR and CGS investment, reduces the investment hurdle, and can be a catalyzer for large-scale and widespread CO2 storage in Europe.

One of the challenges of operating sensors in seabed is the lifespan of the sensors. Such sensors are commonly powered by batteries when other alternatives, such as tidal or solar energy, are unavailable. However, the batteries have a limited lifespan and must be recharged or replaced periodically, which is costly and impractical. A thermoelectric cap, which harvests the thermal energy of hydrothermal fluids through a conduction pipe and converts the heat to electrical energy by using thermoelectric generators, was developed to avoid these inconveniences. The thermoelectric cap was combined with a power and temperature measurement system that enables the thermoelectric cap to power a light-emitting diode lamp, an electronic load (6052), and 16 thermocouples continuously. The thermoelectric cap was field tested at a shallow hydrothermal vent site near Kueishantao islet, which is located offshore of northeastern Taiwan. By using the thermal gradient between hydrothermal fluids and seawater, the thermoelectric cap obtained a sustained power of 0.2-0.5 W during the field test. The thermoelectric cap successfully powered the 16 thermocouples and recorded the temperature of the hydrothermal fluids during the entire field test. Our results show that the thermal energy of hydrothermal fluids can be an alternative renewable power source for oceanographic research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Related heptamers are rarely or never found as direct repeats. TAACTGA direct repeats are also found in some other Beggiatoaceae, Thiocystis violascens, a range of Cyanobacteria, and five Bacteroidetes. This phylogenetic distribution suggests they may have been transmitted horizontally, but no mechanism is evident. There is no correlation between total TAACTGA occurrences and repeats per genome.

Candidates include members of the ribosomal protein Si, Csp (cold shock protein), and Csr (carbon storage regulator) families. No pattern was evident in the predicted functions of the open reading frames (ORFs) downstream of repeats, but some encode presumably essential products such as ribosomal proteins. Among these is an ORF encoding a possible alternate or modified RNA polymerase beta prime subunit, predicted to have the expected subunit interaction domains but lacking most catalytic residues. A similar ORF was found in the Thioploca ingrica draft genome, but in no others. In both species they are immediately upstream of putative sensor kinase genes with nearly identical domain structures.

The EA-IRMS system will enhance the scientific and technological education of a socially and economically diverse body of students of all ages, and will substantially advance ongoing and future research by UNH faculty. Specifically, the proposed instrument will enhance the Northern Ecosystems Research for Undergraduates (NERU) program which brings students recruited from underrepresented groups to UNH to study changing northern ecosystems. Stable isotope work has been critical in the majority of NERU projects, and enhanced analytical capabilities at UNH will expand the range of projects for the students, while reducing analytical costs for the program. Access to the EA-IRMS will be provided for middle and high school teachers and students through partnering with the Joan and James Leitzel Center for Mathematics, Science and Engineering Education at UNH, and will provide an opportunity for chemistry, biology, and earth science teachers to use cutting-edge techniques to enhance their scientific and technological preparedness. The proposed instrument will also strengthen the UNH curriculum through creation of two new stable isotope courses and inclusion in up to 13 other UNH courses that together will expose more than 1000 students per year to training in isotopic analyses. Additionally, stable isotope analysis will be integrated into two extensive, ongoing projects promoting healthy nutrition in young adults: the College Health and Nutrition Assessment Survey and a USDA Multi-State Research Project. These projects seek to promote healthy eating habits for students of diverse socioeconomic background and ethnicity across 11 states. The need for stable isotope analysis has increased dramatically in recent years as a result of the increase in number and breadth of research disciplines that rely on stable isotope techniques, as well as the rapid technological improvements in stable isotope analysis. At UNH, faculty from diverse disciplines will use the EA-IRMS to study a broad range of research topics including: 1) methane cycling in wetlands; 2) coastal nitrogen pollution; 3) marine methyl hydrate production; 4) archaeological analysis of cod fisheries; 5) long term trends in the carbon and water cycles of temperate and tropical forests; 6) the role of wetlands and river systems on controlling flooding and water pollution 7) effects of forest management on small mammal communities; 8) bacterial and fungal controls on soil carbon storage; 9) crop, weed, and soil management for improved food production; 10) the role of fungi in forest ecology and climate change; 11) evaluating the impact of dietary food choices on young adult health;12) linking dairy cow diet to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions; and 13) tracking the consumption of agricultural and human supplied food in deer populations.

Post-fledging birds often had substantial parasite infections that resulted in debilitation and death. Most juvenile mortalities occurred on the coast of western Victoria, sometimes as 'wrecks' of considerable numbers of birds that, in the survey period, seemed to be an annual event. The liver fluke Mawsonotrema eudyptulae appeared to be the most pathogenic of the parasites; renal and/or intestinal coccidiosis, intestinal cestodiasis and gastric ulceration associated with ascarid helminthiasis (Contracaecum sp.) were alternative or supplementary problems in some birds. In late winter/spring 1984 and 1985, adult Little Penguins in Port Phillip Bay died of starvation, apparently directly resulting from food deprivation. Affected birds had no major parasitic burdens or other disease that may have influenced their ability to forage.

It is argued that LNG is expanding as a new major energy technology around the Baltic due to its capacity to fulfill policy expectations in three issue-areas: enhancing energy security, providing low-sulphur bunker fuel, and balancing renewables in the power sector. The analysis of linkages between these actions situations emphasizes the spatial, temporal, and discursive aspects of energy infrastructure governance at the regional level.

J,,,,,,,,,"SCHULTZ, EM.",,DEVELOPING AND IMPROVING FOREST AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS FOR INVENTORY AND MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Dec 01 2014,2014,"This proposal represents the next phase in long-term forestry research efforts based on a progression of field plots, models, findings, and software development realized by scientists at the Mississippi State University Forest and Wildlife Research Center over the past 36 years. It builds on a foundation of accomplishments in the areas of forest inventory, growth and yield prediction, modeling, and computer applications while adding a new emphasis area in the measurement of environmental variables that natural resource professionals utilize in ecosystem assessments. The overall objective of the proposed research is to provide or improve algorithms and computer applications that enhance the management and sustainable utilization of forest resources in Mississippi and the mid-Gulf South and make them readily accessible to forest industry, managers, and landowners.Research Problem 1. Improved stand table projectionThe ability to predict the growth and yield of individual tree species or mixed species stands is integral to the comparison of future management regimes, financial analysis, and ultimate sustainability. Most growth and yield systems require many years (30 to 40) of data collection and complicated modeling plus development of computer interfaces to integrate the complicated models into a system that can be readily utilized. Stand table projection is a less complex and widely used procedure for predicting forest stand growth and yield in the absence of a system of growth, yield, and mortality models. Commonly used projection procedures are derived from conventional forest inventory stand tables and past diameter growth rates determined from increment borings (Avery and Burkhart 2002). However, the procedure is flawed because it usually assumes 1) a constant stand density or assumed mortality rate, 2) a constant growth rate, and 3) the same diameter to height relationship over time. Typically stand table projections over-estimate future growth. Any procedure that can adjust this excessive projection downward to provide more reasonable estimates would be a great improvement. Generalized procedures will be investigated to alleviate as much of each of the problems with stand table projection as possible and provide a more useful short-term alternative to growth and yield models.Research Problem 2. Forest disaster recovery/resilienceForestlands play a significant role in the long-term community development and economic prosperity of Mississippi. According to Mississippi Institute for Forest Inventory (MIFI) data, approximately 66% of the land base is classified as forestland (Matney and Schultz 2011). Because of the state's Gulf coastal location and susceptibility to catastrophic natural hazards (e.g., tropical storms, wildfire, invasive plants and animals), forest policy and management plans should be designed to encourage a resilient forest environment for adaption to natural disasters or extreme environmental stressors. The landfall of Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, had a substantial impact on the forests and biological resources of southeast Mississippi (Glass 2006). Because the MIFI 2005 Southeast Region inventory (Glass 2006) occurred immediately after Katrina, a unique research opportunity was presented to assess natural hazard risks to current forest conditions and evaluate forest resilience. The 2006 MIFI inventory served to both quantify storm damage and create a baseline for predicting recovery by factors such as forest type/species, age, and stand condition factors. This research problem will focus on the prediction of forest resilience/recovery and creation of software tools that can be used to support forest management decisions for minimizing risk due to hurricanes and other types of storm events.Research Problem 3. Biomass/carbon prediction The forest products industry is a major component of Mississippi's economic base, with timber one of the most valuable crops accounting for more than 2.42% of the state's total employment (Dahal et al. 2013). In 2010, the forest products industry provided 2.43 billion dollars of value-added, and the total direct, indirect, and induced output of the forest products industry was 10.38 billion dollars (Dahal et al. 2013). The location of bioenergy companies (such as BHT Quitman Hickory, Bluefire Ethanol, Interchem, and Kior) in the state over the last several years promises to add even more value and importance to Mississippi's forest industry. Assuming an increased future demand for woody biomass/carbon, it is essential to anticipate the changes that the bioenergy market could have on the state's forest resources and biomass/carbon allocation patterns and distributions and their ramifications. Natural disasters, pests, and other factors (such as economic circumstances) can also play a role in changing biomass distribution patterns. Because the necessary inventory and assessment tools (produced from previous work) are in place, opportunities are afforded to study the potential impacts of forest and environmental change on biomass/carbon allocations. This research area will explore the effects changes/shifts in forest characteristics such as species or stand origin (plantation versus natural), land use, forest distribution and spatial patterns (parcel size), afforestation and urbanization, age distribution, management, stand density, SI, site quality, and genetics.Research Problem 4. Measurement and evaluation of environmental assessment variablesChanges in natural resource management and issues in regard to hydrological concerns, wetland designations and restoration, invasive fauna and flora (e.g., pythons, kudzu, cogon grass), environmental and social assessments (e.g., NEPA requirements), environmental impact statements (i.e., projects using federal dollars), sourcing of wood (i.e., controlled wood), bioenergy, oil and gas extraction in forested settings (e.g., fracking processes), and endangered species (e.g., red-cockaded woodpecker, gopher tortoise), to name a few, have intensified over the last several decades. Foresters and other natural resource professionals are being asked to monitor, quantify, and assess these activities in light of increasing pressures on our natural resource base, and as a result, new technology in data collection, processing, analysis, and reporting is needed. Examples of potential end-users for this technology include the state departments of Environmental Quality, the Environmental Protection Agency, Timber Investment Management Organizations (TIMOS, e.g., The Forestland Group), Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS, e.g., Anderson-Tully Company, Plum Creek, Weyerhaeuser NR Company), consulting firms (e.g. F4Tech, Larson and McGowin) USDA Forest Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and emerging bioenergy companies (e.g., BHT Quitman Hickory).This research problem area will focus on integrating environmental assessment data with existing forest inventory software and creating specialized processing algorithms. The longer term goals of this integration are 1) designing, implementing, and statistically analyzing ecosystem inventories, 2) interfacing with environmental measurement instrumentation, 3) evaluating the status of important ecosystem components, 4) describing and interpreting interactions and relationships, and 5) projecting future ecosystem conditions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1005221; 812021,,,,,,,,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:12517949,,

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is part of the suite of technologies that will contribute to lowering atmospheric emissions of CO2 from Australia's energy system. There are a wide variety of technologies at various stages of technical and commercial readiness, with more development underway for cost effective CO2 capture and storage. Our research will provide new knowledge to inform cost-efficient measurement, monitoring and verification (MMV) of the environment of CCS projects in coastal waters. --o-- Description: Measurements are made with a Battelle Seaology pCO2 monitoring system (MApCO2), a Seabird Seaphox (for dissolved oxygen, pH, Seawater Temperature and Salinity), mounted on a surface buoy similar to the system described in Sutton et al. (2014). The seawater sensor intakes for the MapCO2 and Seaphox are located at about 1m water depth. The CO2 measurement uses a bubble equilibrator (Sutton et al., 2014), where the air from the equilibrator headspace is circulated through a LI-COR 820 non-dispersive infrared detector (NDIR) for measurement of CO2. The system carries out an automated measurement sequence every 2 hours and starts on the even UTC hour, which is the sample time that is recorded. At the beginning of each measurement sequence, the NDIR undergoes a two point calibration with a zero CO2 gas and a high CO2 standard span gas (typically 450-550 micromol/mol), which bracket the range of CO2 mole fractions in seawater and air. The zero CO2 gas is generated by cycling air through a soda lime chamber and silica gel to remove CO2 and water vapour, respectively. The CO2 span gas is prepared by the NOAA Earth Systems Research Laboratory in the USA and calibrated on the WMO X2007 scale with a standard deviation of 0.06 micromol/mol (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccl/airstandard.html). Each measurement cycle of zero and span gas, equilibrator headspace, and air takes 20 minutes with the equilibrator headspace measurement occurring at about 17 minutes after start of the cycle followed by the air measurement. The pressure measurements are considered the same for the equilibrator headspace gas and air measurements due to the design of the MapCO2 system (Sutton et al., 2014) as are the temperature and salinity of the surface seawater and the equilibrator measured by the Seabird Seaphox. The Seaphox takes a reading every hour in the UTC hour and is transmitted real time through acoustic and/or 3G modems. The Seaphox consist out of a SeaFET (pH) and SBE-37-SMP-ODO CTD (SW temperature, Salinity and Dissolved Oxygen [SBE63]). A. J. Sutton, C. L. Sabine, S. Maenner-Jones, N. Lawrence-Slavas, C.

These effects can include reduced tree growth and fecundity, elevated tree mortality, alterations in tree-species composition, degradation of forest succession, and a substantial decline in forest carbon storage. We examined the individual impacts of fragmentation and edge effects (0-100-m transect from edge to forest interior) on the liana community and liana-host tree interactions in rainforests of the Atherton Tableland in north Queensland, Australia. We compared the liana and tree community, the traits of liana-infested trees, and determinants of the rates of tree infestation within five forest fragments (23-58ha in area) and five nearby intact-forest sites. Fragmented forests experienced considerable disturbance-induced degradation at their edges, resulting in a significant increase in liana abundance. This effect penetrated to significantly greater depths in forest fragments than in intact forests. The composition of the liana community in terms of climbing guilds was significantly different between fragmented and intact forests, likely because forest edges had more small-sized trees favoring particular liana guilds which preferentially use these for climbing trellises. Sites that had higher liana abundances also exhibited higher infestation rates of trees, as did sites with the largest lianas. However, large lianas were associated with low-disturbance forest sites. Our study shows that edge disturbance of forest fragments significantly altered the abundance and community composition of lianas and their ecological relationships with trees, with liana impacts on trees being elevated in fragments relative to intact forests. Consequently, effective control of lianas in forest fragments requires management practices which directly focus on minimizing forest edge disturbance.",,,,,,,,,46,2,0,0,40,0,53,,,2045-7758,,,,,,,,,,,"James Cook Univ, Ctr TESS, Coll Sci & Engn, Cairns, Qld, AustraliaBasque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Leioa, SpainCSIC, EBD, Seville, SpainBharathiar Univ, Root & Soil Biol Lab, Dept Bot, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India",,,,2018-04-01,WOS:000430807200037,29721294,

Additionally, a decrease in the area and thickness of sea ice could lead to enhanced Arctic ship traffic, for example due to shorter routes of cargo ships. Changes in the emissions of aerosol particles can then influence cloud properties, precipitation, surface albedo, and radiation. Next to changes in aerosol emissions, clouds will also be affected by increases in Arctic temperatures and humidities. In this study, we quantify how future aerosol radiative forcings and cloud radiative effects might change in the Arctic in late summer (July-August) and early autumn (September-October).Simulations were conducted for the years 2004 and 2050 with the global aerosol-climate model ECHAM6-HAM2. For 2050, simulations with and without additional ship emissions in the Arctic were carried out to quantify the impact of these emissions on the Arctic climate.In the future, sea salt as well as dimethyl sulfide emissions and burdens will increase in the Arctic. The increase in cloud condensation nuclei, which is due to changes in aerosol particles and meteorology, will enhance cloud droplet number concentrations over the Arctic Ocean (+10% in late summer and +29% in early autumn; in-cloud values averaged between 75 and 90 degrees N). Furthermore, both liquid and total water path will increase (+10% and +8% in late summer; +34% and +26% in early autumn) since the specific humidity will be enhanced due to higher temperatures and the exposure of the ocean's surface.Changes in both aerosol radiative forcings and cloud radiative effects at the top of the atmosphere will not be dominated by the aerosol particles and clouds themselves but by the decrease in surface albedo (and by the increase in surface temperature for the longwave cloud radiative effect in early autumn). Mainly due to the reduction in sea ice, the aerosol radiative forcing will become less positive (decreasing from 0.53 to 0.36W m(-2) in late summer and from 0.15 to 0.11W m(-2) in early autumn). The decrease in sea ice is also mainly responsible for changes in the net cloud radiative effect, which will become more negative in late summer (changing from -36 to -46W m(-2)). Therefore, the cooling component of both aerosols and clouds will gain importance in the future.We found that future Arctic ship emissions related to transport and oil and gas extraction (Peters et al., 2011) will not have a large impact on clouds and radiation: changes in aerosols only become significant when we increase these ship emissions by a factor of 10. However, even with 10-fold ship emissions, the net aerosol radiative forcing shows no significant changes. Enhanced black carbon deposition on snow leads to a locally significant but very small increase in radiative forcing over the central Arctic Ocean in early autumn (no significant increase for average between 75 and 90 degrees N). Furthermore, the 10-fold higher ship emissions increase the optical thickness and lifetime of clouds in late summer (net cloud radiative effect changing from 48 to 52Wm(-2)). These aerosol-cloud effects have a considerably larger influence on the radiative forcing than the direct effects of particles (both aerosol particles in the atmosphere and particles deposited on snow). In summary, future ship emissions of aerosols and their precursor gases might have a net cooling effect, which is small compared to other changes in future Arctic climate such as those caused by the decrease in surface albedo.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,5,0,26,,,1680-7316,1680-7324,,,,,,,,,,"Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, SwitzerlandStockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden",,,,2018-08-02,WOS:000439635700001,,

Strategies to reduce emissions can consist of a fuel switch, engine changes, or end-of-pipe technologies, but they do not necessarily imply reduced life cycle emissions. The present paper assesses the environmental performance of marine fuels from well-to-propeller using life cycle assessment (LCA). Four fossil fuels are compared: heavy fuel oil (HFO), marine gas oil, gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuel, and liquefied natural gas (LNG), combined with two exhaust abatement techniques: open-loop scrubber and selective catalytic reduction. LNG and other alternatives that comply with the SECA 2015 and Tier III NOx requirements give decreased acidification and eutrophication potentials with 78-90 per cent in a life cycle perspective compared with HFO. In contrast, the use of LNG does not decrease the global warming potential by more than 8-20 per cent, the amount depending mainly on the magnitude of the methane slip from the gas engine. None of the fossil fuels scrutinized here would decrease the greenhouse gas emissions significantly from a life cycle perspective. The study supports the need for LCA when evaluating the environmental impact of a fuel change, e.g. it is found that the highest global warming potential during the whole life cycle is connected to the alternatives with GTL fuel.",,,,,,,,,148,2,0,0,19,1,160,,,1475-0902,2041-3084,,,,,,,,,,"Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Shipping & Marine Technol, SE-41296 Gothenburg, SwedenSwedish Environm Res Inst, IVL, S-40258 Gothenburg, Sweden",,,,2011-05-01,WOS:000292126400002,,

A lot of research has been devoted to prevent and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the atmosphere, in order to mitigate the effects of climate change. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is one of the technologies that might help to limit emissions. In complement, direct CO2 removal from the atmosphere has been proposed after the emissions have occurred. But, the removal of all the excess anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 will not be enough, due to the fact that CO2 outgases from the ocean as its solubility is dependent of its atmospheric partial pressure. Bringing back the Earth average surface temperature to pre-industrial levels would require the removal of all previously emitted CO2. Thus, the atmospheric removal of other greenhouse gases is necessary. This article proposes a combination of disrupting techniques to transform nitrous oxide (N2O), the third most important greenhouse gas (GHG) in terms of current radiative forcing, which is harmful for the ozone layer and possesses quite high global warming potential.

In this paper, a systematic review was conducted and 18 LCA studies of OET were analyzed. Most of the LCA studies are focused on wave and tidal energy.

Recent studies have underlined the importance of climatic variables in determining tree height and biomass in tropical forests. Nonetheless, the effects of climate on tropical forest carbon stocks remain uncertain. In particular, the application of process-based dynamic global vegetation models has led to contrasting conclusions regarding the potential impact of climate change on tropical forest carbon storage.2. Using a correlative approach based on a bioclimatic envelope model and data from 1771 forest plots inventoried during the period 1996-2013 in Madagascar over a large climatic gradient, we show that temperature seasonality, annual precipitation and mean annual temperature are key variables in determining forest above-ground carbon density.3. Taking into account the explicative climate variables, we obtained an accurate (R-2 = 70% and RMSE = 40 Mg ha(-1)) forest carbon map for Madagascar at 250 m resolution for the year 2010. This national map was more accurate than previously published global carbon maps (R-2 = 26% and RMSE >= 63 Mg ha(-1)).4. Combining our model with the climatic projections for Madagascar from 7 IPCC CMIP5 global climate models following the RCP 8.5, we forecast an average forest carbon stock loss of 17% (range: 7-24%) by the year 2080. For comparison, a spatially homogeneous deforestation of 0.5% per year on the same period would lead to a loss of 30% of the forest carbon stock.5. Synthesis. Our study shows that climate change is likely to induce a decrease in tropical forest carbon stocks. This loss could be due to a decrease in the average tree size and to shifts in tree species distribution, with the selection of small-statured species. In Madagascar, climate-induced carbon emissions might be, at least, of the same order of magnitude as emissions associated with anthropogenic deforestation.",,,,,,,,,56,2,0,0,35,1,64,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,,,,,,,"Cirad UPR BSEF, F-34398 Montpellier, FranceHelvetas Swiss Intercooperat, BP 3044, Antananarivo 101, MadagascarBern Univ Appl Sci HAFL, CH-3052 Bern, SwitzerlandETC Terra, F-75020 Paris, FranceWildlife Conservat Soc, Antananarivo 101, MadagascarMinist Environm & Forets, Direct Gen Forets, Antananarivo 101, MadagascarMissouri Bot Garden, BP 3391, Antananarivo 101, MadagascarWWF Madagascar & Western Indian Ocean Programme, BP 738, Antananarivo 101, MadagascarUniv Kent, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Sch Anthropol & Conservat, Canterbury, Kent, EnglandBlue Ventures Blue Forests Program, Ambanja, MadagascarConservat Int Africa & Madagascar Field Div, Antananarivo 101, MadagascarUniv Antananarivo, Dept Eaux & Forets, BP 175, Antananarivo, MadagascarONE, BP 822, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar",Helvetas Swiss IntercooperatBern Univ Appl Sci HAFLETC TerraWildlife Conservat SocMinist Environm & ForetsWWF Madagascar & Western Indian Ocean ProgrammeBlue Ventures Blue Forests ProgramConservat Int Africa & Madagascar Field DivONE,,,2016-07-27,WOS:000379014900009,,

Pregnant bears den in snow banks for more than 3 months in winter during which they give birth to and nurture young. Denning is one of the most vulnerable times in polar bear life history as the family group cannot simply walk away from a disturbance without jeopardizing survival of newly born cubs. The ANWR includes the 1002 Area, a region recently opened for oil and gas exploration by the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI). As a part of its mission, the DOI ... protects and manages the Nation's natural resources ... and is therefore responsible for conserving polar bears and encouraging development of energy potential. Because future industrial activities could overlap habitats used by denning polar bears, identifying these habitats can inform the decisions of resource managers tasked to develop resources and protect polar bears. To help inform these efforts, we qualitatively compared the distribution of denning habitat identified by two different methods: previously published habitat from manual interpretation of aerial photographs, and habitat derived by computer interrogation of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IfSAR) digital terrain models (DTM). Because photograph-interpreted methods depicted denning habitat as a line and IfSAR-derived methods depicted habitat as a polygon, we assessed agreement between the two methods with distance measurements. We found that 77.5 percent of IfSAR-derived denning habitat (79.6 km2; 1.2 percent of the 6,837.0 km2 1002 Area) was within 600 m of photograph-interpreted habitat (3,026.9 km), including 53.9 percent within 200 m. This distribution differed from that of randomly distributed points, as only 49.4 percent of these occurred within 600 m of photograph-interpreted habitat, including 18.3 percent within 200 m. Both methods appear to identify the major physiographic features that polar bears might select for denning. IfSAR-derived methods identified habitat at greater frequency beyond major landscape features such as coastal bluffs, river banks and lakeshores, were more likely to identify isolated pockets of putative denning habitat, and were easier to implement than deriving habitat from photograph-interpretive efforts. However, previous research suggests that photograph-interpretation methods may identify denning habitat more correctly than computer interrogation of IfSAR DTMs. Future work should quantify the distribution of IfSAR-derived denning habitat relative to actual landscape features and polar bear maternal dens in the 1002 Area, and investigate the feasibility of habitat identification from finer grained DTMs.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0196-1497,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-03-28,ZOOREC:ZOOR15504019346,,

Several causes can increase formation fluid pressure i.e. rapid loading of sediments results compaction disequilibrium, thermal expansion of fluids, compression and/or upliftment of strata by tectonic forces, generation of oil and gas from organic matter and its volume expansion due to high thermal stress within the restricted pore volume in subsurface condition. Few global examples on overpressure occurrences have been compiled in the paper with special reference to Bengal Basin. Emphasis has been given on methodology and interpretation on abnormal pressure detection in Bengal Basin with a compiled data package on generated curves (Geologs), charts, tables in a systematic way to understand the depth/stratigraphic horizons proved/interpreted as proved or likely to be within transition and overpressure regime. The integrated analysis indicates that the wells drilled in the east of Eocene hinge zone in the onshore and offshore parts of Bengal Basin have penetrated overpressure formation within Miocene in the depth range of 2800 m to 5340 m and the mud weight used to control this overpressure zone was more than 2.0 sp gr mud. The generated Geologs can be used as reference to understand the regime of transition and overpressure, as a valuable document for exploration drilling planning and monitoring. The generated model curve (modified using available data after Hottman and Johnson, 1956 curve) using sonic departure (i.e. Delta t(ob(sh)) - Delta t(n(sh))) from drilled wells may be used as an additional tool to find out the expected formation pressure gradient and equivalent mud weight in all future wells. The correlation of wells based on the trend of dcs and sigma logs will be useful for predicting transition and overpressure top provided all the parameters required for calculating dcs and sigma log recorded smoothly during drilling phase. The study has brought out the detail procedure to generate the pressure profile in the future wells. The generation of pressure profile of a well prior to drilling has got immense importance in oil industry. The drilling of the well should be done by maintaining the optimum mud weight generated from the pressure profile. In case, during drilling, formation pressure is more than the mud pressure, resulted gas kicks or worse, blowouts of the well. Excessively high mud pressure can fracture the formation and cause lost circulation. The oil and gas companies, worldwide, attributed 15% losses due to various problems associated with drilling complications, mostly related to improper pressure prediction of a well. The losses include loss of material as well as drilling process continuity, called non-productive time (NPT).

The main stem of 43 trees was measured every metre from the ground to the top by two skilled arborists. All trees were micro-drilled in two to four axes at three points along the stem (0.3 m, 1.3 m, 2.3 m), and at the tree's live crown. A total of 300 drilling profiles were assessed for decay. Simple linear regression analysis tested the correlation of decayed wood (cm(2)) against a vitality index and stem DBH. Decay was more frequent and extensive in U. procera, than P. acerifolia and least in C. maculata. Decay was found to be distributed in three different ways in the three different genera. For U. procera, decay did appear to be distributed as a column from the base to the live crown; whereas, decay was distributed as a cone-shape in P. acerifolia and was less likely to be located beyond 2.3 m. In C. maculata decay was distributed as pockets of variable shape and size. The vitality index showed a weak but not significant correlation with the proportion of decayed wood for P. acerifolia and C. maculata but not for U. procera. However, in U. procera, a strong and significant relationship was found between DBH and stem volume loss (R-2 = 0.8006, P = 0.0046, n = 15). The actual volume loss ranged from 0.17 to 0.75 m(3), equivalent to 5%-25% of the stem volume. The carbon loss due to decayed wood for all species ranged between 69-110 kg per tree. Based on model's calculation, the stem volume of U. procera trees with DBH >= 40 cm needs to be discounted by a factor of 13% due to decayed wood regardless of the vitality index. Decayed wood reduces significantly the tree's standing volume and needs to be considered to better assess the carbon storage potential of urban forests.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,5,0,8,,,1618-8667,1610-8167,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Burnley Campus,500 Yarra Blvd, Richmond, Vic, AustraliaAustralian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000427197500016,,

Collection of monitoring reports of oil mist and oil vapor in the mud handling areas of offshore drilling installations was done during visits to eight oil companies and five drilling contractors. A questionnaire was sent to the rig owners requesting information about technical design of the shaker area. Linear mixed-effects models were developed using concentration of oil mist or oil vapor measured by stationary sampling as dependent variables, drilling installation as random effect, and potential determinants related to process technical parameters and technical design of the shale shaker area as fixed effects. The dataset comprised stationary measurements of oil mist (n = 464) and oil vapor (n = 462) from the period 1998 to 2004. The arithmetic mean concentrations of oil mist and oil vapor were 3.89 mg/m(3) and 39.7 mg/m(3), respectively. The air concentration models including significant determinants such as viscosity of base oil, mud temperature, well section, type of rig, localization of shaker, mechanical air supply, air grids in outer wall, air curtain in front of shakers, and season explained 35% and 17% of the total variance in oil vapor and oil mist, respectively. The developed models could be used to indicate what impact differences in technical design and changes in process parameters have on air concentrations of oil mist and oil vapor.

To attain these targets, it will have to reduce CO2 emissions to near zero by mid-century and subsequently remove CO2 from the atmosphere during the latter half of the century. There is a recognized need to develop technologies for CO2 removal; however, attempts to develop direct air-capture systems have faced both energetic and financial constraints. Recently, BioEnergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) has emerged as a leading candidate for removing CO2 from the atmosphere. However, BECCS can have negative consequences on land, nutrient, and water use as well as biodiversity and food production. Here, we describe an alternative approach based on the large-scale industrial production of marine microalgae. When cultivated with proper attention to power, carbon, and nutrient sources, microalgae can be processed to produce a variety of biopetroleum products, including carbon-neutral biofuels for the transportation sector and long-lived, potentially carbon-negative construction materials for the built environment. In addition to these direct roles in mitigating and potentially reversing the effects of fossil CO2 emissions, microalgae can also play an important indirect role. As microalgae exhibit much higher primary production rates than terrestrial plants, they require much less land area to produce an equivalent amount of bioenergy and/or food. On a global scale, the avoided emissions resulting from displacement of conventional agriculture may exceed the benefits of microalgae biofuels in achieving the climate stabilization goals.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,4,0,26,,,,2328-4277,,,,,,,,,,"Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USAUniv Hawaii, Pacific Aquaculture & Coastal Resources Ctr, Hilo, HI 96720 USACornell Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY USACinglas Ltd, Chester, Cheshire, EnglandBucknell Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USAB&D Engn & Consulting LLC, Lander, WY USABentley Univ, Ctr Integrat Sci & Ind, Waltham, MA USA",Cinglas LtdB&D Engn & Consulting LLC,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000402654700002,,

In the proposed control system, a dynamic-feedback neural network is adapted to model non-linear dynamic system, and the fuzzy logic controller is used to determine the control forces of MR dampers. By use of two feedforward neural networks required voltages and actual MR damper forces are obtained, in which the first neural network and the second one acts as the inverse dynamics model, and the forward dynamics model of the MR dampers, respectively. The most important characteristic of the proposed intelligent control strategy is its inherent robustness and its ability to handle the non-linear behavior of the system. Besides, no mathematical model needed to calculate forces produced by MR dampers. According to linearized Morison equation, wave-induced forces are determined. The performance of the proposed neuro-fuzzy control system is compared with that of a traditional semi-active control strategy, i.e., clipped optimal control system with LQG-target controller, through computer simulations, while the uncontrolled system response is used as the baseline. It is demonstrated that the design of proposed control system framework is more effective than that of the clipped optimal control scheme with LQG-target controller to reduce the vibration of offshore structure.

There is critical and urgent need for long-life unremitting fish monitoring technologies that can help with understanding fish behavior, selecting offshore wind farm sites, operating hydroelectric power plants, and assessing environmental impacts of marine hydrokinetic energy systems. The total market value of global telemetry including fish telemetry tags is estimated to reach $243 billion by 2020. Current fish telemetry tags are constrained by the limited lifetime of batteries, and periodic battery replacements are expensive and harmful to the fish. Another challenge is how to attach these tags to a fish with minimum impact on its normal life. Implanting a tag inside a fish body constitutes a complicated surgery process with the risk of impeding the fish life, and the mechanical clamping to the fin may negatively affect the fish motions. Therefore, this proposal aims at investigating a self-powered strategy and a bio- inspired attachment method for fish telemetry tags through energy harvesting from the surrounding fluid and fish maneuvering. The goals of this GOALI project are to design and validate a novel bio-inspired attachment with a minimal influence on fish life and mobility and a bio-inspired broadband energy harvester to achieve a self-powered fish telemetry tag. The proposed bio-inspired fish tag consists of a bio-inspired bi-stable energy harvester, a bio-inspired sucking disc, an acoustic transmitter, and an integrated circuit board that contains both the transmission circuit, sensors, and the energy-harvesting management circuit. Particularly, the principle behind the Venus flytrap will be fully understood to investigate the snap-through dynamics of the proposed bi-stable galloping piezoelectric harvester subjected to the combined excitations from fish maneuver and fluid flow. The remora-shark symbiotic relationship will be studied and used to guide the design of the bio-inspired sucking pad with stiff metal-based teeny spikes (in mimic the lamellar spinules) to attach the harvester on the fish. The specific work scope includes (1) a bio-inspired design of an attachment mechanism and a self-power sensing and communication system, (2) modeling of the fluid-structure-piezoelectric interaction, (3) the bio-inspired dynamics of the bi-stable piezoelectric energy harvester under complex excitations, and (4) experimental validation on robotic fish, live fish, and on-site demonstrations to investigate the performance and the influence of harvester on the fish life and mobility. The research is integrated with an educational and outreach plan, including course development, undergraduate research, K-12 students and teachers, and opportunities for minorities and women.

These vast hydrocarbon reserves can be largely attributed to the occurrence of abundant mature, excellent to good quality Devonian source rocks. The Middle Devonian Elk Point Group contains several units with hydrocarbon potential including the Evie Formation in British Columbia, the Keg River Formation in northern Alberta, and the Winnipegosis Formation in east-central Alberta and southern Saskatchewan. Many of these are proven source rocks of oils occurring in Middle Devonian reservoirs. Elk Point Group potential source rocks contain a wide variety of organic matter types reflecting the diversity of their depositional environments. No hydrocarbons have been definitively linked to a Beaverhill Lake Group source rock but it is possible that such a unit is the source of Slave Point Formation reservoired oils in northwest Alberta. The Late Devonian Woodbend Group contains the Duvemay Formation, the most prolific Devonian source rock in the Alberta Basin. It is characterized by marine Type II/I organic matter with TOC contents up to 15% in immature samples and is the source of most oils in the Bashaw Reef Complex, the Rimbey-Meadowbrook Reef Trend, and in the Swan Hills Formation in Alberta. The stratigraphically equivalent Muskwa Formation in northern Alberta has a much lower hydrocarbon potential than the Duvernay Formation. Oils have been correlated to Winterburn Group source rocks within the Nisku Formation of east-central Alberta, Camrose Member/Nisku Formation of southern Alberta, and the time-equivalent Birdbear Formation of southeast Saskatchewan. Winterburn Group potential source rocks in central to southern Alberta can have high TOC contents (up to 15%) and contain Type I and Type II organic matter deposited in open marine to lagoonal palacoenvironments. The Cynthia Member shale of the Nisku Formation in west-central Alberta, previously thought by some workers to be a source rock, is actually organic-lean. The underlying Bigoray Member is more organic-rich and may be a minor contributor to hydrocarbons in the West Pembina area. The Wabamun Group contains no regionally extensive potential source rocks. Almost all the oil generated from Devonian source rocks appears to have remained within Devonian-aged reservoirs and very little is biodegraded. In contrast, where Exshaw Formation sourced oil is found in Devonian reservoirs, such as in the Grosmont and Nisku formations in the vicinity of the Athabasca Mannville Group bitumen deposit (i.e. Carbonate Trend), it tends to be biodegraded.",,,,,,,,,53,5,0,0,2,0,63,,,0007-4802,,,,,,,,,,,"Geol Survey Canada, Calgary, AB T2L 2A7, CanadaShell Canada Ltd, Calgary, AB T2P 2H5, Canada",,,,2001-03-01,WOS:000170190500005,,

Traditional methods to monitor above-ground biomass (AGB) rely on on-ground measurements, which are expensive, labour intensive and cover small spatial scales. Structure from Motion and Multi-View Stereo reconstructions from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles imagery (UAV-SfM) have the potential to increase fieldwork efficiency by providing a greater amount of spatial information in less time. However, there is still a need to assess the ability of UAV-SfM to retrieve structural information of mangrove forests, which could pose challenges in areas of high forest complexity and density.In this study we successfully used UAV-SfM data to estimate height, canopy diameter and AGB of natural and rehabilitated mangrove forests across two regions of the southeastern coast of Australia. We used a variable window filter algorithm to detect trees with an 80% detection rate when considering the top canopy. Individual tree canopy segmentation was performed using a marker-controlled watershed segmentation with two sets of constraining markers: treetops and a minimum height below which a pixel is not considered part of a tree.Direct comparison with on-ground measurements at the regional level showed no significant difference in tree height and AGB medians when only top canopy was considered. Similarly, median canopy diameters were not significantly different in natural areas of both regions, but significant differences were found in rehabilitated areas. UAV-SfM estimates of AGB were on average 15% lower in natural areas and 10% higher in rehabilitated areas when compared to on-ground measurements and followed a strong linear relationship close to the ideal one-to-one relationship.Additionally, we performed a cost-benefit analysis of the two methodologies. UAV-SfM methods can save almost AU$ 50,000 per ha when compared to on-ground measurements and become cost-effective (based on total costs) after just 15 days of surveys. The methods described in this study open the possibility for easily repeatable, low-cost UAV-SfM surveys for local managers by providing a faster, more cost-effective approach for monitoring mangrove forests over larger areas than traditional on-ground surveys while maintaining forest inventory data accuracy in both natural and rehabilitated mangrove forests.",,,,,,,,,86,10,0,0,27,2,99,,,0034-4257,1879-0704,,,,,,,,,,"Deakin Univ, Fac Sci Engn & Built Environm, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Warrnambool, Vic 3280, AustraliaDeakin Univ, Fac Sci Engn & Built Environm, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",,,,2020-06-01,WOS:000523965600027,,

The conservation of artefacts coming from the underwater environment has began in the mid XXth century and developed through a great deal of effort which has resulted in a strong improvement of scientific and multidisciplinary research. Case-studies are various and it is clear that conservative approaches and choices are, sometimes, in contrast: an improvement of the state of the art in this particular field is therefore actual. The considered examples concern different experiences both in historical features and in their conservative tracks.

Nowadays, due not only to the inherent technical challenges associated to deep-water applications but also to the increasing importance of the HSE aspects and requirements faced by the industry, a crescent demand to implement a philosophy which focalizes safety, reliability and integrity of their subsea flowing systems is taking place.The handling of monitored data in order to help the pipe operator to control fluid transportation throughout flexible pipes is an old practice performed by Petrobras and other oil companies in the world. However, the idea of acquiring a product which has been conceived, designed and manufactured with both intrinsic monitoring and expert systems is a recent idea. The tendency of the main flexible pipe manufactures is normally to face the problem from the traditional point of view: those systems are considered dissociated one from the other and as appendices to be installed, in the field, after system connection and start-up. Experience demonstrates that the installation of those systems during the operation phase has a number of limitations, restrictions, and associated problems.The main objective of this paper is to present an integrity management strategy based on the concept of the self-monitored flexible riser. Self-monitoring is understood as the own capacity of a product (flexible pipe and components with built-in devices) to acquire data about itself and make use of data from the internal and external environments, during its service life. Monitored data is then processed in order to generate relevant information for the fluid transportation business. The basic premise is to select, during product conception phase, some key-parameters to be further monitored, during the operation phase. The selection is determined by technical criteria depending on the potential failure mechanisms and modes related to the particularities of each different application.",,,,,26th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering26th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering,"JUN 10-15, 2007JUN 10-15, 2007",,"San Diego, CASan Diego, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4269-0,,,,,,,,,"PETROBRAS E&P, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000249558900053,,

As they are vulnerable to changes in temperature and precipitation, a rapidly changing environment endangers peatlands and their carbon storage potential. Understanding the mechanisms of peatland carbon accumulation from studying past developments may, therefore, help to assess the future role of tropical peatlands. Using a multi-proxy palaeoecological approach, a peat core taken from the Sungai Buluh peatland in Central Sumatra has been analyzed for its pollen and spore, macro charcoal and biogeochemical composition. The result suggests that peat and C accumulation rates were driven mainly by sea level change, river water level, climatic variability and anthropogenic activities. It is also suggested that peat C accumulation in Sungai Buluh is correlated to the abundance of Freycinetia, Myrtaceae, Calophyllum, Stemonuraceae, Ficus and Euphorbiaceae. Sungai Buluh has reasonable potential for being a future global tropical peat C sinks. However, considering the impact of rapid global climate change in addition to land-use change following rapid economic growth in Indonesia, such potential may be lost. Taking advantage of available palaeoecological records and advances made in Quaternary studies, some considerations for management practice such as identification of priority taxa and conservation sites are suggested.

In this study, we determined the influence of natural ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation on the lethal and sublethal toxicity of dispersed crude oil to naupliar stages of the planktonic copepods Acartia tonsa, Temora turbinate and Pseudodiaptomus pelagicus. Low concentrations of dispersed crude oil (1 mu L L-1) caused a significant reduction in survival, growth and swimming activity of copepod nauplii after 48 h of exposure. UVB radiation increased toxicity of dispersed crude oil by 13-3.8 times, depending on the experiment and measured variables. Ingestion of crude oil droplets may increase photoenhanced toxicity of crude oil to copepod nauplii by enhancing photosensitization. Photoenhanced sublethal toxicity was significantly higher when T. turbinata nauplii were exposed to dispersant-treated oil than crude oil alone, suggesting that chemical dispersion of crude oil may promote photoenhanced toxicity to marine zooplankton. Our results demonstrate that acute exposure to concentrations of dispersed crude oil and dispersant (Corexit 9500) commonly found in the sea after oil spills are highly toxic to copepod nauplii and that natural levels of UVB radiation substantially increase the toxicity of crude oil to these planktonic organisms. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering sunlight in petroleum toxicological studies and models to better estimate the impact of crude oil spills on marine zooplankton.

After disconnection, drilling mud in the riser discharges directly from the riser bottom, and seawater refills the vacancy emptied out after mud falling through refill valves. This paper presents two new simulation procedures for this unsteady flow. The first one is a whole fluid column (WFC) model and it is solved by a cubic equation. The second one is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) procedure, in which two high-resolution CFD schemes are applied for the first time to discrete a special governing equation, and Level Set method is adopted to track the interface between mud column and refilled seawater at each time step. Two methods can respectively provide variations of flow velocity, fluid pressure, whole column weight and flow friction force in a whole mud release duration. In particular, WFC method can easily predict overall trends of several parameters during a whole discharge period, which are prerequisite parameters for dynamic analysis of a riser in hanging state; CFD method is very sensitive to every detailed fluctuation of velocity and pressure in the initial moment of mud discharge, and can be integrated into a structural model for riser recoil response analysis. For a drilling riser with 2150 m, it takes 195.83 s to replace all mud column by seawater, and the maximal discharge velocity is 14.61 m/s. During mud falling, the top of mud column keeps static for 2.29 s before the first pressure wave reaches, and fluid pressure of part column section drops to zero and lasts 1-3 s. In addition, the maximal values of fluid weight-loss and friction force are both close to half of the whole column weight. These results are beneficial for riser system design and risk control of riser recoil. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is outlined here, however, that a significant portion of drylands occur over sedimentary basins hosting natural gas and oil reservoirs, where gas migration to the surface takes place, producing positive fluxes of methane into the atmosphere. New field surveys, in different hydrocarbon-prone basins, confirm that microseepage, enhanced by faults and fractures in the rocks, overcomes the methanotrophic consumption occurring in dry soil throughout large areas, especially in the winter season. Fluxes of a few units to some tens of mg m(-2) day(-1) are frequent over oil-gas fields, whose global extent is estimated at 3.5-4.2 million km(2); higher fluxes (>50 mg m(-2) day(-1)) are primarily, but not exclusively, found in basins characterized by macro-seeps. Microseepage may however potentially exist over a wider area (similar to 8 million km(2), i.e. 15% of global drylands), including the Total Petroleum Systems, coal measures and portions of sedimentary basins that have experienced thermogenesis. Based on a relatively large and geographically dispersed data-set (563 measurements) from different hydrocarbon-prone basins in USA and Europe, upscaling suggests that global microseepage emission exceeding 10 Tg year(-1) is very likely. Microseepage is then only one component of a wider class of geological sources, including mud volcanoes, seeps, geothermal and marine seepage, which cannot be ignored in the atmospheric methane budget.

This article concludes that in order to justify their operations in the Arctic, the Norwegian and Russian companies emphasise values based on discourses that have historically and culturally been associated with masculine practices, such as the control of nature enabled by technology. These justifications are thus reinforcing the narrative of the Arctic as a territory to be conquered and mastered. Even though the companies operate in different sociopolitical contexts, the grounds of justification are rather similar. Their biggest differences occur in their visual presentations of gender, which I argue is part of the justification.

Instead of assuming a single stakeholder as in centralized models, we consider different stakeholders, including the upstream shale gas producer and the midstream shale gas processor. Following the Stackelberg game, the shale gas producer is identified as the leader, whose objectives include maximizing its net present value (NPV) and minimizing the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The shale gas processor is identified as the follower that takes actions after the leader to maximize its own NPV. The resulting problem is a multiobjective mixed-integer bilevel linear programming problem, which cannot be solved directly using any off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Therefore, an efficient projection-based reformulation and decomposition algorithm is further presented. Based on a case study of the Marcellus shale play, the non-cooperative model not only captures the interactions between stakeholders but also provides more realistic solutions.

However, to stabilize the climate at a warming level closer to the present day, such as the well below 2 degrees C aspiration in the Paris Agreement, a net-zero carbon emission by 2050 is still insufficient. The recent IPCC special report calls for a massive scheme to extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere, in addition to decarbonization, to reach negative net emissions at the mid-century mark. Another ambitious proposal is solar-radiation-based geoengineering schemes, including injecting sulfur gas into the stratosphere. Despite being in public debate for years, these two leading geoengineering schemes have not been directly compared under a consistent analytical framework using global climate models.Here we present the first explicit analysis of the hydroclimate impacts of these two geoengineering approaches using two recently available large-ensemble (>10 members) model experiments conducted by a family of state-of-the-art Earth system models. The CO2-based mitigation simulation is designed to include both emission cuts and carbon capture. The solar-radiation-based mitigation simulation is designed to inject sulfur gas strategically at specified altitudes and latitudes and run a feedback control algorithm to avoid common problems previously identified such as the overcooling of the tropics and large-scale precipitation shifts.Our analysis focuses on the projected aridity conditions over the Americas in the 21st century in detailed terms of the potential mitigation benefits, the temporal evolution, the spatial distribution (within North and South America), the relative efficiency, and the physical mechanisms. We show that sulfur injection, in contrast to previous notions of leading to excessive terrestrial drying (in terms of precipitation reduction) while offsetting the global mean greenhouse gas (GHG) warming, will instead mitigate the projected drying tendency under RCP8.5. The surface energy balance change induced by sulfur injection, in addition to the well-known response in temperature and precipitation, plays a crucial role in determining the overall terrestrial hydroclimate response.However, when normalized by the same amount of avoided global warming in these simulations, sulfur injection is less effective in curbing the worsening trend of regional land aridity in the Americas under RCP8.5 when compared with carbon capture. Temporally, the climate benefit of sulfur injection will emerge more quickly, even when both schemes are hypothetically started in the same year of 2020. Spatially, both schemes are effective in curbing the drying trend over North America. However, for South America, the sulfur injection scheme is particularly more effective for the sub-Amazon region (southern Brazil), while the carbon capture scheme is more effective for the Amazon region. We conclude that despite the apparent limitations (such as an inability to address ocean acidification) and potential side effects (such as changes to the ozone layer), innovative means of sulfur injection should continue to be explored as a potential low-cost option in the climate solution toolbox, complementing other mitigation approaches such as emission cuts and carbon capture (Cao et al., 2017). Our results demonstrate the urgent need for multi-model comparison studies and detailed regional assessments in other parts of the world.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,2190-4979,2190-4987,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USASun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai 519000, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaSun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nat Disas, Zhuhai 519000, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaNatl Ctr Atmospher Res, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USARutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ USACornell Univ, Mech & Aerosp Engn, Ithaca, NY USAChinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Key Lab Atmospher Chem CMA, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaUniv Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Nottingham, England",,,,2020-08-21,WOS:000557452000001,,

Their presence has been reported in several wastewater streams, including produced water (PW), which is the wastewater obtained during oil and gas extraction from onshore or offshore installations. In this study, ferrate (VI) oxidation was used for the first time for the treatment of 15 PAHs, with the total concentration of 1249.11 mu g/L in the produced water sample. The operating parameters viz., ferrate (VI) dosage, pH, and contact time were optimized for maximum removal of PAHs and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Central composite design (CCD) based on response surface methodology (RSM) was used for optimization and modeling to evaluate the optimal values of operating parameters. PAH and COD removal percentages were selected as the dependent variables. The study showed that 89.73% of PAHs and 73.41% of COD were removed from PW at the optimal conditions of independent variables, i.e., ferrate (VI) concentration (19.35 mg/L), pH (7.1), and contact time (68.34 min). The high values of the coefficient of determination (R-2) for PAH (96.50%) and COD (98.05%) removals show the accuracy and the suitability of the models. The results showed that ferrate (VI) oxidation was an efficient treatment method for the successful removal of PAHs and COD from PW.

Yet an unsustainable production with low productivity and short duration is generally encountered. The marine hydrate reservoirs are mostly highly water-saturated; the resulting water production behaviors remain largely unclear. In this work, the gas and specially water production from a water-saturated reservoir were investigated. The role of water acting as a diffusion barrier of gas was determined: a higher water yield will significantly improve the following gas production. The step-wise depressurization was found to help relieve the initial water production compared with the straight-forward depressurization scenario. A high-water-production stage was for the first time identified, accounting for similar to 47% of the total water production. A further controlled depressurization with finer steps in this stage could enhance the gas productivity by at most 31%; yet its effect on controlling water production was limited. The cumulative water yield depended much on the overall degree of depressurization, regardless of the number of steps. In order for an enhanced gas production under a regulated water yield, thermal stimulation is introduced in the high-water-production stage. This is found to effectively contribute to an optimized water producing process and an at least 30% decline of water yield under comparable gas productivity. The proposed combination method could be applied in the field tests from water-saturated marine reservoir to achieve a high gaswater ratio and a thereby improved energy and economic efficiency.",,,,,,,,,73,4,0,0,9,0,76,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,,,,,,,"Dalian Univ Technol, Key Lab Ocean Energy Utilisat & Energy Conservat, Minist Educ, Dalian 116024, Peoples R ChinaTsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Shenzhen Int Grad Sch, Tsinghua Berkeley Shenzhen Inst, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",,,,2020-10-05,WOS:000571441800001,,

The FRAT is applied to proposed pipeline stream crossings and evaluates the risk to fisheries resources from geohazards causing sedimentation impacts. Ultimately, the FRAT may be applied across Canada to streamline DFO's regulatory process for pipeline stream crossings.The FRAT consists of a Geophysical Database that characterizes physical attributes of the river valley and channel in the vicinity of a crossing, plus a Fisheries Database that characterizes the fisheries resources and habitat of the stream. Algorithms have been developed to quantitatively estimate sedimentation hazard likelihood and fisheries sensitivity, which are coupled in a qualitative risk matrix that assigns an overall risk rating to each stream crossing. The overall risk rating then designates the level of regulatory review and authorization process carried out by DFO under the Fisheries Act.Geohazard algorithms are being calibrated and tested using field data and stream crossing construction scenarios are being incorporated into the risk assessment tool.This paper describes the FRAT and its application in the Mackenzie Valley, and presents preliminary results from risk analysis of pipeline stream crossings.",,,,,ASME International Pipelines Conference (IPC 2008)ASME International Pipelines Conference (IPC 2008),"SEP 29-OCT 03, 2008SEP 29-OCT 03, 2008",ASMEASME,"Calgary, CANADACalgary, CANADA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4857-9,,,,,,,,,"Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Vancouver, BC, Canada",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000265679400033,,

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is part of the suite of technologies that will contribute to lowering atmospheric emissions of CO2 from Australia's energy system. There are a wide variety of technologies at various stages of technical and commercial readiness, with more development underway for cost effective CO2 capture and storage. Our research will provide new knowledge to inform cost-efficient measurement, monitoring and verification (MMV) of the environment of CCS projects in coastal waters. --o-- Description: rements are made with a Battelle Seaology pCO2 monitoring system (MApCO2), a Seabird Seaphox (for dissolved oxygen, pH, Seawater Temperature and Salinity), mounted on a surface buoy similar to the system described in Sutton et al. (2014). The seawater sensor intakes for the MapCO2 and Seaphox are located at about 1m water depth. The CO2 measurement uses a bubble equilibrator (Sutton et al., 2014), where the air from the equilibrator headspace is circulated through a LI-COR 820 non-dispersive infrared detector (NDIR) for measurement of CO2. The system carries out an automated measurement sequence every 2 hours and starts on the even UTC hour, which is the sample time that is recorded.

The sensor measurement using factory calibrations for the LI-CO2 820 is typically within 1 micromol/mol of the reference gas value. If the LI-COR 820 measurements and the CO2-in-air reference gas values are different by more than 2 micromol/mol, a correction is applied to Li-CO2 820 output based the reference gas values. A seawater bath operated over a range of temperatures and CO2 expected in the field is then used to check the MapCO2 system (equilibrator and LI-COR 820 measurement) against a General Oceanics 8050 CO2 sensor to ensure the systems agree within 2 micromol/mol. Pressure measurements are made using the LI-COR 820 pressure sensor, checked against a Druck DPI142 pressure indicator and verified to agree within 0.5 kPa before and after each deployment. Seaphox: SBE 37 (T, S, DO) and the SeaFET (pH) are calibrated by the factory and verified in the CSIRO laboratory.

The site is well known in terms of stratigraphy and structural settings, due to the data available from the coal mining activity. On the basis of these data, a potential deep reservoir and the caprock can be recognized; more in detail, in the southern sector of the basin, the top of the potential reservoir reaches a suitable depth for storage. At the same time, the already existing infrastructures (the Sotacarbo Research Centre on carbon capture, utilization and storage), coupled with some peculiar features (as the low natural seismicity, the hydrogeological system, etc.) makes the Sulcis area a potential experimental site capable to further develop CO2 storage technologies, such as low-cost drilling, site monitoring, and experimental studies on CO2 diffusion and leakage.In this context, Sotacarbo (in cooperation with ENEA, the Universities of Cagliari and Rome La Sapienza, OGS, INGV and RSE) is leading a very ambitious research program, funded by both the Italian and the Sardinian Regional Governments within two different and complementary projects, to characterize the Sulcis coal basin as a potential site for the development of CO2 geological storage technologies. The research activities are structured in two different phases: (i) site characterization, including the construction of an underground and a fault laboratories and (ii) the installation of a test site for small-scale injection of CO2. In particular, the underground laboratory will host geochemical and geophysical experiments on rocks, taking advantages of the buried environment and the very well confined conditions in the galleries; in parallel, the fault laboratory will be constructed to study CO2 leakage phenomena in a selected fault.Overall, the project, which is currently ongoing, will allow to characterize the Sulcis basin and to develop a permanent infrastructure (know-how, equipment, laboratories, etc.) for advanced international studies on CO2 storage. This work describes the whole Sulcis CO2 storage project, highlighting its current status, some of the preliminary results of site characterization phase, planned activities and the links with the research activities on carbon capture and utilization.

The model without oil droplet uptake was able to predict 75% of the observations within one order of magnitude. Total PAH body burdens were predicted within a factor of five. For most species, inclusion of oil droplet uptake did not improve model accuracy, suggesting a negligible contribution of oil droplet uptake to PAH bioaccumulation.

This review draws on studies of high-reliability manufacturing and process industries to examine the roles of intraorganizational factors (particularly organizational culture) that may promote or detract from the achievement of high reliability in subsea systems. External factors, such as supply chain coordination, are also considered. Studies of organizational change designed to enhance the reliability of design and manufacturing processes are rare in the subsea industry, but relevant issues arising from change initiatives in other organizational settings are discussed. Finally, several areas are identified in which systematic industry-based research could contribute to identifying critical elements in the development and operation of subsea systems and, hence, reduce the risk of failures.

Cathodic protection (CP) can effectively prevent general corrosion of the chains from the surrounding seawater. However, hydrogen atoms in the water can be liberated at the surface of the links because of the cathodic reaction and diffuse into the steel, causing hydrogen embrittlement of the material. As a result, the fracture toughness of the chain link material drops. There is a dearth of knowledge about the fracture toughness of chain link material when subjected to the operating environment. This paper presents and discusses results from full-scale fracture toughness testing of a studless mooring chain link grade R5 in NaC1 solution under CP. The chain link was subjected to tensile step loading while being completely submerged in the environment. There was evidence of crack extension beyond the fatigue pre -crack that was imposed on the chain link. However, there was no definitive quantitative evidence at which step load the crack extension began. The post-test metallographic analysis showed that the crack extension due to hydrogen embrittlement has taken place in two steps. Taking into account the compressive residual stress caused by manufacturing at the crack tip, the maximum stress intensity factor (K) value that came from the second step load of 70351(N was 2735N/mml 5. The average fracture toughness of the material in the same environment measured from small scale testing was 2372N/mml 5. This value is acceptably near the full-scale value considering the difference in the notch depth ratio, and the design of small-scale specimens having higher constraint, expected to give lower toughness. The results at this stage suggest that smallscale specimens can give conservative predictions of full-scale behaviour of mooring chain links. 2019 The Authors.

However, these technologies can still contribute to larger-scale forms of precision agriculture at the region, mill, farm or paddock level. If the sugar industry decides that using global positioning system and geographic information system to chase the benefits of selective harvesting is potentially worthwhile, sorting out the spatial and temporal interactions between yield and CCS will be a critical research issue.

Several independent industry and community sectors, such as petroleum, water, geological carbon storage, coal seam methane and geothermal, will be competing for access to, and the use of, limited pore space and the resources within it. These sectors are often in direct conflict, for example geothermal energy production and geological carbon storage (GCS) are almost mutually exclusive. Geothermal is also in competition with the water sector (agriculture, communities etc) for the right-to-produce fluids.This new environment requires an innovative and proactive response from government, one in which the relative value and benefit of a wide variety of known and potential resources can be quantitatively assessed, and thereby managed, for the benefit of the State. This requires the building of robust and high-resolution geoscience information and knowledge systems which support the informed management of basins as multiple use zones, thus enabling the GCS, geothermal, petroleum and water sectors to co-exist and prosper. These basin resource management frameworks must be constructed at a regional-scale to allow assessments to be made of potential impacts and relative values of all relevant earth resources.As part of the Victorian Government's geological carbon storage assessment, GeoScience Victoria's VicGCS initiative has been collating, interpreting and integrating a wide-range of disparate geoscientific data from the onshore and offshore Gippsland Basin, the premier geological carbon storage location in Australia. The data include the distribution and properties of sedimentary horizons and faults (including the construction of basin-scale 3D models), rock property data, fluid compositions (water, hydrocarbons etc) and fluid flow properties, pressure data, reservoir data and extensive investigations of containment, to build highly complex and predictive geoscience models. In addition to providing a quantitative and agreed means of assessing and managing earth resources, the models provide data and ideas which dramatically improve the understanding of the current and undiscovered resource inventory.The basin resource management framework for the Gippsland Basin provides government with the management tool-kit and knowledge necessary to develop an informed strategy to manage the basin's pore space and other resources, in order to maximize the benefit from each resource and to minimize potential conflicts between competing resource sectors. This knowledge will also facilitate the gazettal of GCS acreage, GCS roll-out, and provide the basis for monitoring the basin through the GCS life-cycle. For example, through sufficient understanding of fluid migration in the basin, it is possible to monitor plumes of injected CO2, as well as the far-field effects of the injected plumes (e.g. formation pressure and the water table) across the entire basin. The regional or basin-scale knowledge required by government complements the focused and much more site-specific studies undertaken by industry.

This study introduces an innovative method that integrates the economic and environmental aspects of sustainability to support decisions on the synthesis of the modem ship energy systems. The method includes a simulation model for predicting the energy systems performance during the ship lifetime. The genetic algorithm NSGA-II, is employed to solve the multi-objective combinatorial optimisation problem of selecting the integrated ship energy systems configuration. The derived results are visualised to reveal the Pareto front and the trade-offs among the objectives. The method is novel in supporting the synthesis of the integrated ship energy systems, as it includes both environmental and economic objectives, as well as evaluates the performance of the systems over an expected operational profile. The developed method is implemented for the case study of an Aframax oil tanker and the derived results analysis indicates that the ship energy systems sustainability can be improved by adopting LNG fuel and dual fuel engines technology, as well as by introducing other emerging technologies like fuel cells and carbon capture, although the latter is associated with a high cost.

The aerogel is prepared through incorporating graphene oxide (GO) into alginate (ALG) matrix by using a facile combined freeze-drying and ionic cross-linking method. The 3D structure interconnected by ALG and GO ensures the high mechanical strength and good flexibility of the developed aerogel. The rough microstructure combined with the hydrophilicity of the aerogel ensures its excellent underwater superoleophobic and antifouling properties. High-content polysaccharides contained in the aerogel guarantees its excellent salt-tolerant property. More impressively, the developed aerogel can retain its underwater superoleophobicity even after 30 days of immersion in seawater, indicating its good stability in marine environments. Furthermore, the aerogel could separate various oil/water mixtures with high separation efficiency (> 99%) and good reusability (at least 40 cycles).

In order to mitigate the risk associated with the failure, the pipes/equipment are regularly inspected, monitored or tested using various techniques. These inspection-monitoring-testing activities can provide valuable data/information about the existing condition of the pipes/equipment and provide direction for future maintenance activities. Unfortunately, all these inspection-maintenance activities may result in a vast amount of, potentially imperfect, data that may be difficult to interpret. Currently, data from various stages: design, operation, inspection, monitoring and maintenance etc. are collected but often inefficiently used. The decisions regarding future inspection and maintenance programs are therefore made without taking into consideration all relevant data.

The salvaging and study of the Sinan shipwreck from 1976 to 1984 could be considered the birth of Korean underwater archeology. The large number of Chinese products that were loaded on the Sinan has contributed greatly to our understanding of the reality of trade in East Asia at that time. Along with the large quantity of Chinese ceramics, the presence of Goryeo celadon, albeit only seven pieces, is also significant.The discovery of Goryeo celadon from the Sinan shipwreck sparked gradual interest in Gogryo celadon excavated in China since the second half of the 1980s. Since the 2000s, a considerable number of Goryeo celadon shards of high quality have been excavated in Zhejiang Province, especially in Hangzhou and Ningbo. This signifies that at the time large quantities of Goryeo celadon were converging in Ningbo, an international trade port. In addition, many pieces of Goryeo celadon have been excavated at the court sites in Hangzhou (then called Lin'an), previously the capital of the Southern Song (南宋, 1127~1279) Dynasty. They were of the highest quality, which suggests that Goryeo celadon was highly appreciated in the court of the Southern Song court where they were presumably used. Recently, scholars argue that it is highly probable that the celadons shipped to Japan on the Sinan vessel had been collected in Ningbo, and that much of the Goryeo celadon excavated in Japan must have been delivered to Japan via China along this same route. But the quantity of Goryeo celadon is too small to confirm whether it was being shipped to Japan to order. Neither is there any evidence to confirm that Japanese customers considered this celadon ware as being from Goryeo, and thus in Japan they possibly were broadly assumed to be Chinese.The Goryeo celadon that Xu Jing (徐兢, 1091~1153) had admired was introduced to Emperor Huizong (徽宗, r. 1100~1125) of Song as well as to the court of the Northern Song (北宋, 690~1127). The excavation of sites related to the Southern Song court has demonstrated that Goryeo celadon must have been of the highest quality, and that its appreciation continued in the court of the Southern Song. During the Song dynasties, Ru wares (汝窯) and Guan wares (官窯) were examples of celadon culture reaching its peak. The fact that Goryeo celadon wares were accepted and used at court alongside the Ru and Guan wares signifies that they were exceptionally appreciated as foreign ceramic wares. In other words, the unique aesthetics of Goryeo celadon, which had developed with influence from various Chinese ceramics, was then highly appreciated in return by people of the Song Dynasty, the home of celadon, and such appreciation lasted a very long time. The Goryeo celadon wares excavated in China are valuable evidence proving such Chinese appreciation. The seven pieces of Goryeo celadon found in the Sinan shipwreck, despite being small in number, are good examples of such appreciation.",,,,"원대 至治3年(1323)에 중국 닝보(당시의 경원)을 출항해 일본 하카타로 향하던 도중 전라남도 신안 앞바다에서 침몰한 침몰선, 이른바 ‘신안선’에 대해 1976년부터 1984년까지 실시된 인양조사는 한국 수중고고학의 시작이었다고 할 수 있다. 신안선에는 대량의 중국 문물들이 실려 있어 당시의 동아시아 교역의 실체를 이해하는 데 매우 큰 역할을 했다. 방대한 양의 중국 도자들에 섞여 7점의 고려 청자도 발견되었는데 그 수량은 적지만 이 또한 큰 의미를 갖는다.신안선에서 고려 청자가 발견된 것이 계기가 되어 1980년대 후반부터 중국 출토 고려 청자에 대한 관심이 점차 높아졌다. 그리고 2000년대 이후 특히 항저우와 닝보를 중심으로 절강 지역에서 상당한 수의 질 높은 다양한 고려 청자 파편이 출토되었다. 이를 통해 국제무역항인 닝보에 많은 고려 청자가 모여들었던 당시의 상황을 알 수 있다. 또한 남송의 도읍이었던 항저우(당시의 임안)의 궁정 유적에서 남송 궁정에서 사용됐던 매우 질이 높은 고려 청자가 다수 출토되어 남송 궁정에서 고려 청자가 높은 평가를 받았음을 말해주고 있다. 이렇게 닝보에 모여들었던 고려 청자의 일부가 신안선에 실려 일본으로 향했던 것이며, 일본에서 출토된 고려 청자의 상당수도 이렇게 중국을 경유해 전해졌을 가능성이 최근에 제기되고 있다. 다만 그 수가 적어 고려 청자가 과연 일본측의 주문에 의해 실린 것인지는 의문이며, 일본의 수요자측(직접 거래에 관여한 상인 등은 제외)이 당시 이렇게 들어온 고려 청자를 ‘고려 청자’로 인식했었음을 확인할 수 있는 흔적이 없어 고려 청자는 일본에서 넓은 의미의 ‘당물’로 수용되었던 것으로 추측된다.북송의 서긍을 경탄케 한 고려 청자는 휘종을 비롯해 북송 궁정에도 전해졌는데 이러한 북송의 고려 청자에 대한 평가는 남송 궁정으로도 이어져 남송 궁정 관련 유적에서 최고급 고려 청자가 출토되고 있다. 여요와 관요 등 청자 문화가 절정에 달했던 송대에 고려 청자가 수용되어 여요와 관요 등과 함께 궁정에서 사용된 것은 외국산 도자로서는 파격적인 평가라 할 수 있다. 다양한 중국 도자의 영향을 받으면서 발전해 온 고려 청자가 이뤄낸 독자적인 아름다움이 거꾸로 청자의 본고장인 중국, 송나라 사람들에게 높은 평가를 받았으며 그 평가는 오랜 후까지 이어졌다. 중국에서 출토된 고려 청자는 이렇듯 중국에서 높은 평가를 받았음을 보여주는 귀중한 증거라 할 수 있다. 신안선에 실려 있던 고려 청자는 7점에 불과하지만 중국에서의 고려 청자에대한 평가를 잘 보여준다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0540-4568,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-12-29,KJD:ART002174309,,

This study considers the effect of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO2]) on the OR of a hardwood forest after nine growing seasons of Free-Air CO2 Enrichment. We measured changes in the carbon oxidation state (C-ox) of biomass and soil carbon pools as a proxy for the ecosystem OR. The OR of net primary production, 1.039, was not affected by elevated [CO2]. However, the C-ox of the soil carbon pool was 40% higher at elevated [CO2], and the estimated OR values for soil respiration increased from 1.006 at ambient [CO2] to 1.054 at elevated [CO2]. A biochemical inventory of the soil organic matter ascribed the increases in C-ox and OR to faster turnover of reduced substrates, lignin and lipids, at elevated [CO2]. This implicates the heterotrophic soil community response to elevated [CO2] as a driver of disequilibrium in the ecosystem OR. The oxidation of soil carbon pool constitutes an unexpected terrestrial O-2 sink. Carbon budgets constructed under the assumption of OR equilibrium would equate such a terrestrial O-2 sink to CO2 uptake by the ocean.

After the completion of the mission, the AUV returns to download the data to the operator and be re-programmed for the next mission. Thus, AUV's have the capabilities to observe autonomously, but they cannot physically intervene in a situation, and they need human instruction in order to carry out the given mission. One of the tasks that AUVs are used for in underwater intervention missions is vision. The proposed project is focused on infrastructure inspection, detection of faults that could occur in a variety of underwater structures and taking the necessary actions using computer vision and decision making in an underwater robot. The research question of the project is: how can intervention by underwater vehicles be achieved using deep learning for computer vision to create a self-controlled AUV capable of critically analysing objects and acting accordingly for the given mission? Therefore, the aim is to investigate the feasibility of physical intervention by an AUV.To achieve physical intervention from an underwater vehicle which would be able critically to decide how to act in any given task and to mitigate the problem, computer vision will be implemented using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Using ML, the robot would be able to recognise the object of interest and then to inspect it for faults. From the acquired vision information, ML algorithms will analyse the data, learn from that data, and finally make critical decisions in terms of the AUV's actions. Initially, the system's image recognition will be trained using an in-house developed dataset of images. The image recognition will be based on existing ML techniques using neural networks such as Convolutional Neural Networks. The next step would be to introduce the system to the actual underwater environment, which adds further complexity to the vision system due to blurring and low visibility. Upon successful image recognition, the system will be further developed to make decisions on how to react or intervene upon recognising a fault. Furthermore, throughout the different steps of the project, virtual simulations will take place in order to assess the system's performance and make the necessary adjustments. Finally, the fully developed system will be implemented on a physical prototype and will be tested in a laboratory environment to assess its performance. The anticipated outcomes of the project will be the development of an algorithm capable of identifying and inspecting underwater objects similar to those in a real underwater environment, and of physically intervening when a fault is detected.The project will have a positive impact in industrial sectors such as the oil and gas industry, and the shipping industry will also benefit since they are seeking autonomous intervention technologies to use for equipment monitoring, fault detection and actively taking actions for repairing malfunctions in a safest and cost-efficient manner with the minimum environmental disruption.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2274936,,,,,,,,Newcastle University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15298670,,

Among the reasons given is inadequate information on the wind resource potential at the selected site. This stresses the need for a thorough resource evaluation before a wind project is actually implemented. This chapter carries out a wind resource assessment of two sites in Viti Levu using 10-min interval data over a 2 year period obtained from the Fiji Meteorological Services.Considering the mean wind speed, Rakiraki seems to be a more viable option for commissioning a wind farm over Yaqara with a higher wind speed of 6.19 m/s. However, this information is not enough for determining the best site. Thus, the capacity factor (CF) values for two different turbine models were computed by deriving the best probability distribution function (PDF) equation. Out of the three PDFs (Weibull, Gamma and Lognormal) that were tested, the best fit to the observed data was provided by the Weibull distribution. Other criteria, including power output, annual energy production (AEP), cost saved (FJD), cost of electricity (COE) produced and payback period were all evaluated as part of a techno-economic assessment to select the better site out of the two.The results attained revealed that the Vestas V27 model for Rakiraki had the higher CF of 0.304. As for the output power and energy, the Vergnet 275 model for Rakiraki produced the higher values of 73.41 kW and 610,896.38 kWh, respectively. In general, the COE (FJD/kWh) and the payback period for Rakiraki were lower than those for Yaqara. However, for Rakiraki the Vergnet 275 model witnessed a slightly higher COE and payback period over the Vestas V27 model. Moreover, it is clear that Rakiraki is the more viable site for commissioning a wind farm over Yaqara (with AEP estimate of 22,603.17 MWh for the 37 Vergnet turbines). Also, while Vergnet would be more suited for Rakiraki in terms of AEP, cost saved and emission savings of 15,374.5 tCO(2) (when replaced with IDO) and 15,272.4 tCO(2) (when replaced with HFO), it also needs to be considered that the COE and payback period of the same model would be slightly higher over Vestas.This research would be of fundamental importance to policy makers as an aid to formulating a well-planned policy relating to wind energy, thus enabling the usage of a broader range of RE resources.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1574-0919,,978-3-030-30211-5; 978-3-030-30210-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fiji, Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Sci, Lautoka, Fiji",Univ Fiji,,,2021-08-01,WOS:000674776900009,,

The HSE (Health, Safety, Environment) administration initiated a broad process that included the crew oil the installation, the onshore administration and a group of researchers to improve the situation. Instead of focusing the analysis oil incident reports, we applied a proactive view. Thus, we adapted a model for resilience that was used in a development process.

These factors have been identified as important for complexity and necessary for the organization to be able to anticipate, perceive and respond to different constellation of conditions.

Although vertical migration of hydrocarbons (seepages) to the surface from oil and gas fields has been known for many years, this important environmental factor has not yet received due attention in the study of the Arctic and Subarctic regions. The major hydrocarbon-induced chemical and mineralogical changes within the permafrost stratum were investigated in the south of the Taz Peninsula in Western Siberia. The samples of frozen core from the deep (35 m) hole, which had been drilled from the top of hydrolaccolite, were examined to analyze the cryogenic texture of the frozen rock mass, to estimate the gas content in rock and ice, and to determine the authigenous mineral association using SEM and EDX spectroscopy analysis. It is shown that the migration of hydrocarbon gases through the permafrost stratum is caused by shear deformations with the formation of cryogenic crack-type textures on the sliding surfaces, which are characterized by the presence of gas-saturated ice crystallites and high jointing of quartz. It has been established that the migration of hydrocarbons, primarily methane, frozen in sedimentary strata causes significant changes of the pH/Eh parameters: local anaerobic conditions may be changed by micro-aerophilic ones through the formation of oxygen during crystallization of the water in the slide area; mainly neutral and weakly acidic conditions can locally be changed by the alkaline ones due to the cryogenic concentration of chlorides during freezing. It was found that the impulse character of hydrocarbon migration in permeation zones of frozen strata causes mosaic distribution of sulfate and iron reduction processes, which control the neogenesis (including as a result of microbiological processes) of various forms of iron compounds: sulfides - carbonates - oxides.",,,,,,,,,2,0,2,0,0,0,3,,,2076-6734,2412-3765,,,,,,,,,,"RAS, Siberian Branch, Tyumen Sci Ctr, Earth Cryosphere Inst, Tyumen, RussiaTyumen Ind Univ, Tyumen, RussiaLomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow, RussiaTyumen State Univ, Tyumen, Russia",,,,2018-06-06,WOS:000433024900006,,

Such regulation is well known in various other jurisdictions around the world and is regarded as best practice for the regulation of rare but catastrophic events. New regulation in the US must pass the cost/benefit test or alternatively show why strict cost/benefit analysis is inapplicable. This paper argues that safety case regulation can surmount this hurdle. It argues that strict cost/benefit analysis is impossible for safety case regulation and it demonstrates this by providing a detailed critique of the attempts by the European Commission to provide a cost/benefit justification for the introduction of safety case regulation for offshore oil and gas production in its jurisdiction. The paper argues that such regulation can be justified in the US on other grounds; first, the polluter pays principle, second, the fact that society regards multiple fatalities occurring together far more seriously than the same number of fatalities occurring separately; and third, that the incidents to be prevented are viewed by the courts as criminal and therefore to be prevented as a matter of principle.

Both of compounds resulted in developmental malformation of marine medaka embryos, with phenanthrene affecting on peripheral vascular system and yolk sac, while retene affecting on cardiac tissues.

IAM experts in particular consider BECCS as part of a future NETs portfolio; but at the same time, all experts judge the constraints BECCS would face regarding future overall feasibility and more particularly regarding resource competition to be the highest. Regarding the assessment of constraints the ESM experts are much more skeptical than the IAM experts; they also think that the BECCS carbon removal pathways are less sufficiently represented in ESMs compared to what the IAM experts thinks about the representation in their models.

In this study we look at the pore solution chemistry and mineralogy of basaltic glass and crystalline basalt under post-injection conditions, i.e. after rise of the pH via matrix dissolution and the first phase of carbonate formation. Experimental findings indicate that further precipitation of carbonates under more alkaline conditions is highly dependent on the availability of divalent cations. If the pore water is deficient in divalent cations, smectites and/or zeolites will dominate the secondary mineralogy of the pore space, depending on the basalt matrix. At low carbonate alkalinity no additional secondary carbonates are expected to form meaning the remaining pore space is lost to secondary silicates, irrespective of the basalt matrix. At high carbonate alkalinity, some of this limited storage volume may additionally be occupied by dawsonite - if the Na concentration in the percolating groundwater (brine) is high. Using synthetic seawater as a proxy for the groundwater composition and thus furnishing considerable amounts of divalent cations to the carbonated solution, results in massive precipitation of calcite, magnesite, and other Ca/Mg-carbonates under already moderate carbonate alkalinity. More efficient use of the basaltic storage volume can thus be attained by promoting formation of secondary carbonates compared to the inevitable formation of secondary silicate phases at higher pH. This can be done by ensuring that the pore water does not become depleted in divalent cations, even after carbonate formation. Using seawater as carbonating fluid or injection of CO2 into the basaltic oceanic crust, where saline fluids percolate, can reach this goal. However, such an approach needs sophisticated reactive transport modelling to adjust CO2 injection rates in order to avoid too rapid carbonate deposition and clogging of the pore space too close to the injection well.",,,,,,,,,29,1,0,0,4,0,32,,,1750-5836,1878-0148,,,,,,,,,,"Curtin Univ, Dept Appl Geol, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, AustraliaUniv Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, Sturlugata 7, IS-101 Reykjavik, IcelandIceland Geosurvey, Grensasvegur 9, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",Iceland Geosurvey,,,2018-03-12,WOS:000425112100014,,

In this context, farm has a spatial component and the aim of this analysis was to determine if systematic patterns in farm performance expressed by cane yield and CCS persisted over time. There was no spatial relationship between cane yield and CCS. However, the analysis revealed that the relationship between farms was remarkably stable from one year to the next for both attributes and there was some spatial aggregation of farm performance in parts of the mill area. This finding is important, since temporally consistent spatial variation may be exploited to improve regional production. Alternatively, the putative causes of the spatial variation may be explored to enhance the understanding of sugarcane production in the wet tropics of Australia.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,9,0,11,,,0004-9409,,,,,,,,,,,"CSIRO Sustainbale Ecosyst, Aitkenvale, Qld 4814, AustraliaUniv Queensland, Dept Nat & Rural Syst Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, AustraliaUniv Queensland, Sch Land & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, AustraliaJames Cook Univ N Queensland, CRC Sustainable Sugar Prod, Townsville, Qld 4811, AustraliaJames Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",,,,2004-01-01,WOS:000220455800009,,

To illuminate tradeoffs relevant to policymakers, forest sector stakeholders, and consumers of forest products, we utilize three Key Performance Indicatorsaverage carbon storage in the forest and wood products; cumulative timber output; and discounted cash flowto compare four alternative management scenarios for Douglas-fir forests on 64 parcels across western Oregon and Washington. These scenarios are designed to meet one of two alternative management objectives: (i) maximize Net Present Value; or (ii) maximize sustained timber yield; according to one of two alternative sets of forest practice constraints: (i) compliance with minimum Oregon/Washington Forest Practices Act (FPA) rules; or (ii) two key requirements (increased green tree retention and wider riparian buffers) of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification. Improved performance in terms of carbon storage for these alternatives generally also corresponded with reduced Net Present Value and timber yields. The gap between FSC and FPA performance indicators was wider in Oregon than Washington, which is primarily attributed to the higher level of stream protection required under Washington versus Oregon FPA rules. We observed consistently higher average carbon storage per cumulative timber output among FSC scenarios relative to business-as-usual, indicating FSC-certified wood carries an embedded carbon benefit. Our findings highlight options for targeted policies to incentivize management that increases carbon storage and minimizes disruptions in timber output, as well as for narrowing the financial gap (or opportunity cost) that would be involved in a transition away from contemporary common practice on industrial timberlands in the coastal Douglas-fir forests of the Pacific Northwest.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,7,0,19,,,1999-4907,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, POB 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USAEcotrust, 721 NW Ninth Ave,200, Portland, OR 97209 USA",Ecotrust,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000443254400006,,

The vehicle is controlled by a remote control cable from the beach or boat and is equipped with video, still cameras and robotic grippers. Capable of carrying most environmental data gathering instruments the crawler is also able to fly when necessary by filling flotation bladders and using its four mounted thrusters. This capability allows the vehicle to jump from one side of a shipwreck to another or to fly over sensitive regions such as reefs.

Chemical methods to control scale have been developed including scale squeeze treatments and continual chemical injection. A key factor in the success of such treatments is the understanding of chemical placement and the effectiveness of the treatment chemicals. Evaluation of residual chemical concentration and scaling ion chemistry have long been used in monitoring programs. and more recently, probes have been developed that increase the rate of evaluation/interpretation. All these methods prove that the chemical is present in the brine when sampled or that scale formation is not occurring at the point of brine analysis. Evaluation of suspended solids in terms of amount, mineral type, composition, and texture has been used along with brine chemistry to improve our understanding of the location of scale formation within production environments. This paper outlines the experimental methods developed and will cite examples from the North Sea of the use of suspended solids analysis by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and the associated brine chemistry to evaluate the scale risk within the produced brine. The combination of these methods has improved integrated scale manaaement in terms of evaluatirug scale squeeze placement effectiveness, squeeze lifetime, and topside scale-control challenges vs. separation problems.The publication of this method with clear examples of the value it can bring to an integrated scale-management program for a field throughout its life cycle will benefit both emerging deepwater operations (evaluation of placement) and more established oilfield operations (reducing chemical costs).",,,,,2005 SPE International Symposium on Oilfield Chemistry2005 SPE International Symposium on Oilfield Chemistry,"FEB 02-04, 2005FEB 02-04, 2005",Soc Petr EngineersSoc Petr Engineers,"Houston, TXHouston, TX",7,0,0,0,1,0,8,,,1930-1855,,,,,,,,,,,"Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2006-02-01,WOS:000249060900001,,

At present, almost all steel pipelines are sensitive to corrosion in harsh working environments, particularly in salty water and sulphur ingress media. Nowadays, the most commonly practiced solution for a damaged steel pipe is to entirely remove the pipe, to remove only a localized damaged section and then replace it with a new one, or to cover it with a steel patch through welding, respectively. Numerous literatures have shown that fiber-reinforced polymer-based composites can be effectively used for steel pipe repairs. Considerable research has also been carried out on the repair of corroded and gouged pipes incorporated with hybrid natural fiber-reinforced composite wraps. Currently, further research in the field should focus on enhanced use of the lesser and highly explored hybrid-biocomposite material for the development in corrosion prevention. A hybrid-biocomposite material from renewable resource based derivatives is cost-effective, abundantly available, biodegradable, and an environmentally benign alternative for corrosion prevention.

The hydrodynamic characteristics and energy-capturing efficiency of the hydrofoil were obtained, and the influence of complex flows on hydrofoil hydrodynamics was elucidated. The energy dissipation mechanism during hydrofoil motion was characterized. The results indicate that the vortex generation and shedding inevitably dissipates part of the tidal energy captured by the hydrofoil, which leads to abrupt changes in hydrofoil hydrodynamics and reduces energy-capturing efficiency. When the frequency of the abrupt hydrodynamics change matches the hydrofoil natural frequency, it may result in hydrofoil resonance and damage. Also, it is observed that larger pitch amplitude leads to larger optimal reduced frequency corresponding to the peak power cycle-averaged coefficient.

Operators rely on the plant automation system, particularly the DCS, for managing the plant operations which themselves have become open, and involve multiple third-party technologies, instruments, and software. The structural-, scale- and dynamic-complexity makes it challenging for operators to infer the conditions in the plant quickly and make timely decisions, especially during abnormal situations. A process supervision system that assists the operators by providing holistic decision support is therefore essential. Here, we propose an multi agents based architecture for supervision of large-scale chemical plants. The key insight in the proposed architecture is that the process descriptors used for developing the supervision models themselves are not static and change routinely. The proposed architecture uses an ontology to represent all the process descriptors formally, so that any changes can be captured and their effects propagated seamlessly. This architecture has been implemented as a multi agent system called ENCORE. The detailed implementation of ENCORE is presented and its benefits are illustrated through an offshore oil and gas production case study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of a new technique of elemental geochemistry analysis (or chemosteering) became an option for the identification of Cenomanian, Turonian-Coniacian-Santonian, Campanian and Eocene strata. This has enabled more accurate placement of the horizontal development wells within the desired reservoir target interval. Geochemical data enabled the identification of chemostratigraphic zones C1, C2, C3 and zone R that correspond to the reservoir section. The application is a result of the geochemical zonation performed using elements and ratios that are sensitive to depositional environment, sea level change, heavy mineral concentrations and siliciclastic input namely: Sr/Ca, Zr/Th, Si/Zr and Si/K. In ascending stratigraphic order, the ratio thresholds of zone C3 are Zr/Th > 11, Sr/Ca > 1.1, Si/Zr < 22 and Si/K < 19, while zone R corresponds to 5.5 < Zr/Th < 11, Sr/Ca < 1.1, Si/Zr > 22 and Si/K > 19.

In the case of offset wells, 85.9% of the data confirmed the proposed classification and 89.4% for the real-time application case. The zone R shows a strong contrast with the surrounding formations facilitating critical decisions during well placement and geosteering, increasing the reservoir exposure by 28%.

Regional Forest Agreements between four of the States and the Federal Government (1997-2001) resulted in a 36% increase in the area of conservation reserves and a 15% decrease in area of multiple-use (including timber harvesting) forests. The limited acceptance of timber harvesting in native forests, together with the rapid expansion of hardwood plantations, has diverted research focus away from native forests. Recent events including a prolonged drought and two forest fires totaling more than 3 million ha should have stimulated research in native forests on the effects of fire on ecosystem processes, on the management of fire and on management of water catchments; fires, far more than logging, are shaping our native forests in recent times. In particular, the use of prescribed fire to reduce fuels has decreased. We argue that Australian research effort in native eucalypt forests is lacking in two key areas - the effects of fire on carbon storage in forests and soils, and on the management of water yield from forested catchments. The results of forest research are variously published in the scientific journals, and increasingly in consultancy reports to governments or a to a range of organizations and industries. The question of who does the harnessing of knowledge coming from the science of forest ecology is compounded by constant changes in both political and management arrangements. If forest science is to assume a greater role in politics and forest management in Australia, scientists must enter the foray, using the fighting words of politics rather than maintaining the protective mantle of neutrality. With research in native forests being continually downgraded at both State and Federal levels,we take a somewhat less than optimistic view about how well ecological sciences will be harnessed in the service of forest stewardship and sustainability in Australia.

Over the 31 day exposure, there were no treatment related mortalities in juvenile blue crabs. The overall growth and molting of the crabs were not substantially different between the various sediment exposures over the exposure period. Additionally, none of the early biomarkers of biological stress were correlated with PAH concentrations.

In this work, a new coupled model of the behaviors of hydrated bubbles is developed. This model considers the bubble hydrodynamics, gas dissolution, hydrate nucleation time, and dynamic growth of the hydrate shell. In combination with published experimental data, the present model proposes new mass transfer correlations involving hydrated bubble dissolution and water permeation across the hydrate shell to describe the effects of the bubble interface and the hydrate shell structure on the mass transfer processes. Using the proposed model, the rising process of methane bubbles released at depths of 1000-2000 m in the California coast is simulated. The simulated results show that the hydrate nucleation time decreases rapidly as the water depth increases. Furthermore, the formed hydrate shell can reduce the gas bubble rising velocity and shrinkage rate, because it alters the mechanical force balance and gas dissolution rate. This work adds further insights into quantitatively characterizing the upward migration and mass transfer of a hydrated bubble in deep water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, there is an increasing need for more accessible and precise close-range 3D acquisition technologies in some application fields like, for example, monitoring the growth of coral reefs or reconstructing underwater archaeological pieces that in most cases cannot be recovered from the seabed. This paper presents the first results of a research project that aims to investigate the possibility of using active optical techniques for the whole-field 3D reconstructions in an underwater environment. In this work we have tested an optical technique, frequently used for in air acquisition, based on the projection of structured lighting patterns acquired by a stereo vision system. We describe the experimental setup used for the underwater tests, which were conducted in a water tank with different turbidity conditions. The tests have evidenced that the quality of 3D reconstruction is acceptable even with high turbidity values, despite the heavy presence of scattering and absorption effects.

Adding biodiesel made oil detach from pebbles and formed oil-biodiesel mixtures, most of which remained on top of seawater. The total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) removal efficiency increased with biodiesel quantities but the magnitude of augment decreased gradually. When used with petroleum degrading bacteria, the addition of biodiesel (BD), nutrients (NUT) and BD + NUT increased the dehydrogenase activity and decreased the biodegradation half lives. When BD and NUT were replenished at the same time, the TPH removal efficiency was 7.4% higher compared to the total improvement of efficiency when BD and NUT was added separately, indicating an additive effect of biodiesel and nutrients on oil biodegradation.

The apparent activation energy increased from 102.5 kJ mol(-1) to 269.7 kJ mol(-1) with increasing pyrolysis conversion. The kinetic parameters of S. japonica pyrolysis were determined using nonlinear least-squares regression of the experimental data assuming first-order kinetics. The kinetic rate constants indicated that the predominant reaction pathway was B (bio-oil) to C (gas; C-1-C-4), rather than A (S. japonica) to B (bio-oil) and/or to C (gas; C-1-C-4).

After 5 days in 6 parts per thousand, chloride cell (CC) apical and fractional areas increased with no alteration in CC numbers. Elevated CC apical and fractional area was coupled with an increase in CC numbers after 21 days in 6 parts per thousand. In fish adapted to 6 parts per thousand, an increase was found in the area of CC cytoplasm occupied by mitochondria. Branchial Na+-K+-ATPase decreased after 21 days in 6 parts per thousand,, resulting in an uncoupled typical correlative relationship between this enzyme and CC numbers. Kidney Na+-K+-ATPase activity elevated after 5 days in 6 parts per thousand but was not significantly elevated after 21 days. In gill and kidney tissue, alterations were found in the activity of key metabolic enzymes after 5 days acclimation to 6 parts per thousand, with few differences occurring after 21 days. Serum cortisol levels were unaltered by low salinity acclimation suggesting that an increase in the number of CCs found in 6 parts per thousand-adapted S. sarba did not occur as a result of hypercortisolemia. Based on the present evidence, it seems possible that alterations in the form and function of the branchial epithelium may play an important role in the ability of S, sarba to acclimate to low salinity conditions, with renal assistance occurring during short term exposure.

Building from successes in our previous work on managing ecological processes and interactions to improve organic strawberry/vegetable production systems, this proposal addresses the need to develop integrated crop system designs and practices that provide long-term solutions to the problems encountered in today's organic cropping systems. We will provide a dynamic platform for growers in our region to research and discuss systems approaches to improve environmental sustainability and economic viability in a comprehensive manner. The research experiments will test fundamental hypotheses about processes and interactions in organic systems and their relationship to ecosystems services such as nutrient cycling; pest, disease, and weed suppression; and carbon sequestration in the soil. Nitrogen losses to the environment, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use will be used to describe the environmental imprint of practices through direct measurement, modeling and Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). The main experiment will test different rotation treatments using a range of input levels and disease suppression strategies. A sub set of these treatments (chosen by participating farmers) will be repeated across seven farm sites. Crop production, disease suppression, economic performance and environmental impacts of each treatment will be measured and compared using a combination of measurements of N loss and GHG emissions, modeling and LCA. A second set of experiments will be conducted on farms in a more southern strawberry producing region and focus on nitrogen management and use of Biochar to improve soil quality and sequester carbon. The question of whether organic farming can increase soil carbon storage will also be addressed by looking at sites in the region that have been managed organically for different lengths of time from a few to more than 30 years. Methods to enhance biological control of insect pests of strawberry and vegetables will also be evaluated. Our outreach plan includes: holding organic farming seminar series in cooperation with UC farm advisers in summers 2012 and 2014; holding webinars, workshops and a shortcourse through eOrganic.info; creating a series of brochures on topics including rotation design, fertility management, and biological control agent identification to be used by extension specialists and farmers; conducting workshops and on-farm experiments for Spanish-speaking and limited-resource growers with the Agricultural Land-Based Association (ALBA); and providing workshops for small-scale Chinese growers. Project outcomes will be further disseminated through extended networks and newsletters of the Community Alliance with Family Farmers (CAFF), California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF), and eOrganic.info.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2011-51300-30677; 579243,,,,,,,,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:12915760,,

A unique example of 17th-century fashion, it comprises about 300 textile fragments from garments, parts of garments and furnishing fabrics, almost entirely made of silk and embroidered or woven with metal thread. These are in remarkably good con-dition, which may be related to the archaeological environment, the quality of the silk yarns in the fragments, and the presence of metal threads and other metallic objects from the shipwreck. Surviving archaeological maritime silk textiles are extremely rare, which makes this a distinctive find posing challenges for selecting the most suitable conditions for exhibition and storage.Scientific research was carried out with the aim to evaluate the response of modern and archaeological silks to temperature, relative humidity, light and oxygen, in order to define the most suitable parameters for the long-term storage and exhibition of the collection. Artificially aged samples taken from one of the archaeological fragments were analysed at the visual, structural and molecular level by means of colour measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a fluorescence detector (UHPLC-FLD). The results showed that light exposure, in combination with high temperatures, oxygen and moisture strongly affected the silk's structure and molecular composition. Limiting exposure to light and removing oxygen reduced this effect and increased life expectancy significantly. Therefore, the analytical results obtained were essential to defining a preliminary preservation strategy for the collection: while on display, anoxic conditions slow down degradation of the silk by a factor of 4-5, whereas in a in dark storage, a low RH is the most important factor, with anoxic conditions providing additional reduction of decay.

In physical terms, shutting-in a well will usually not cause a loss of the hydrocarbon resource, but in financial terms, the impact of deferred production can have a significant economic effect. Improved ocean observation systems in the Gulf of Mexico are expected to enhance the reliability and accuracy of hurricane forecasting, lowering the probabilities of false positives, and positively impacting the economic and human life consequences. Improved information reduces risk, and to the extent that operators are risk averse, enhanced information increases welfare. The purpose of this paper is to provide a methodological framework to estimate the cost of shut-in production due to extreme weather, and to provide a first-order lower-bound estimate of the market value of improved weather forecasting. Shut-in production is modeled using various recovery scenarios and valued in terms of the cash flow analysis over the life of the asset. A description of the valuation model and the nature of production recovery is outlined and illustrated through stylized examples. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The accepted paradigm is that rapid aggregation of phytoplankton cells occurs, forming large, fresh particles which sink quickly; this concept is incorporated into ecosystem models used to predict the future climate. Here we demonstrate a slower, less efficient export pathway in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific. Lipid biomarkers suggest that the large, fast-sinking particles found beneath the mixed layer are compositionally distinct from those found in the mixed layer and thus not directly and efficiently formed from phytoplankton cells. We postulate that they are formed from the in situ aggregation of smaller, slow-sinking particles over time in the mixed layer itself. This export pathway is likely widespread where smaller phytoplankton species dominate. Its lack of representation in biogeochemical models suggests that they may be currently overestimating the ability of the oceans to store carbon if large, fast-sinking, labile particles dominate simulated particle export.Plain Language Summary The oceans are one of the largest sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide on our planet. One method by which this occurs is through the production of organic material (phytoplankton-plant-like cells) in the surface ocean, which capture atmospheric carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Eventually, the phytoplankton die and sink out of the surface ocean, transporting huge amounts of carbon to the deep ocean where it is stored for centuries or even millennia. Our current understanding is that generally, most organic material sinks quickly as large, fast-sinking (hundreds of meters per day) particles (clumps of dead phytoplankton cells). However, in our study in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean, we were able to show that a different and much slower process occurs where phytoplankton first aggregate to smaller, slower sinking detrital particles and eventually form very degraded larger particles that sink to the deep. This has consequences for estimating ocean carbon storage as smaller particles are respired much quicker than larger particles. Thus, where they are an important part of this carbon sink, such as in the Equatorial Pacific, the proportion phytoplankton-captured atmospheric carbon dioxide being stored in the deep ocean is likely reduced.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,12,0,21,,,2169-8953,2169-8961,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Oceanog Ctr, European Way, Southampton, Hants, EnglandUniv Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, EnglandUniv Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, AustraliaUniv Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, EnglandQueen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England",,,,2018-11-23,WOS:000450067500013,,

Critical screening criteria include permeability/porosity, brittleness (fracability), organic richness and maturity of the shale, thickness and areal extent, and oil/gas shows. Early entry into a play is also critical to success. These criteria can best be determined using multidata sets because they occur at different scales with various levels of complexity.An example is provided which utilized this workflow to determine the detailed geology of the Devonian Woodford Shale in Oklahoma. The Woodford is not only a long-standing hydrocarbon source rock in large parts of the U.S. Midcontinent but more recently has been designated as one of the more prolific and steady unconventional resource shales (oil and gas) in the United States. Deposition was complex, and a function of paleo-karst topography on the underlying Hunton carbonate unconformity, as well as temporal and spatial changes in relative sea level with time. 3D seismic surveys reveal that the highest total organic carbon (TOC) contents are within paleo-karst lows, which have been documented with as much as 300 ft of topographic relief. Strata initially deposited within these oxygen-deficient lows during early transgression now contain relatively high TOC content, low density, and acoustic velocity. Conversely, when biogenic strata flourished in the open, well-circulated, more oxygenated marine waters, and later were buried, organic matter is now low, and biogenic microorganisms (radiolarians in the case of the Woodford) which when deposited and lithified, transformed to brittle biogenic, silica-rich beds, which fracture preferentially to more ductile, interbedded siliceous mudstones. For regional to local mapping of key horizons and stratigraphic intervals, a common and robust sequence stratigraphic framework has been interpreted through several iterations; the framework consists of a lower, organic-rich mudstone sitting upon the underlying topographically variable unconformity, followed upward by increasingly muddy and TOC-rich condensed section and maximum flooding surface, then upward into progressively more progrational highstand biogenic quartz plus river- and wind-blown mud. Application of high-frequency chemostratigraphy and Leeb hardness has helped considerably in deciphering any fine-scale stratigraphic ambiguities that can serve as correlation marker beds.The integration of these various techniques has demonstrated the complexity of the Woodford Shale. The same level of complexity, but with certain predictable commonalities, occurs with other shales. The various shale properties are ultimately a product of the depositional environment (including the unconformity surface), composition, and other such properties that can be pinpointed, or at least estimated as reservoir potential when placed within a sequence stratigraphic framework.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0065-8448,,978-1-119-06669-9; 978-1-11-906668-2,,,,,,,,,"Univ Oklahoma, Sch Geosci, Inst Reservoir Characterizat, Norman, OK 73019 USA",,,,2020-07-28,WOS:000539347300011,,

The northeastern U.S., specifically the Allegheny Plateau in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky, is experiencing rapid exploration. Using Pennsylvania as a proxy for regional development across the Plateau, we examine land cover change due to shale-gas exploration, with emphasis on forest fragmentation. Pennsylvania's shale-gas development is greatest on private land, and is dominated by pads with 1-2 wells; less than 10 % of pads have five wells or more. Approximately 45-62 % of pads occur on agricultural land and 38-54 % in forest land (many in core forest on private land). Development of permits granted as of June 3, 2011, would convert at least 644-1072 ha of agricultural land and 536-894 ha of forest land. Agricultural land conversion suggests that drilling is somewhat competing with food production. Accounting for existing pads and development of all permits would result in at least 649 km of new road, which, along with pipelines, would fragment forest cover. The Susquehanna River basin (feeding the Chesapeake Bay), is most developed, with 885 pads (26 % in core forest); permit data suggests the basin will experience continued heavy development. The intensity of core forest disturbance, where many headwater streams occur, suggests that such streams should become a focus of aquatic monitoring. Given the intense development on private lands, we believe a regional strategy is needed to help guide infrastructure development, so that habitat loss, farmland conversion, and the risk to waterways are better managed.",,,,,,,,,117,4,0,0,77,0,145,,,0364-152X,1432-1009,,,,,,,,,,"Penn State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USAPenn State Univ, Sch Forest Resources, University Pk, PA 16802 USAPenn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,,,2012-05-01,WOS:000303477700011,22447181,

The most prominent NET is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), which is typically envisioned to use terrestrial crops as feedstock. Several recent studies have focused on aquatic BECCS (A-BECCS), making use of microalgae or macroalgae as feedstock, as possible means of reducing water and land use. However, the high logistical complexity of the A-BECCS supply chain makes it likely that regional biophysical and socio-technical factors will strongly influence its overall favorability. Therefore, this study applies life-cycle assessment (LCA) incorporating a geographic information system (GIS) framework to estimate the environmental impacts of A-BECCS over all stages of its life-cycle. Three candidate locations in the USA are evaluated based on seemingly good proximity to coastal regions and CO2 storage; namely, East Coast, West Coast, and the Gulf of Mexico. Monte Carlo simulation is used to characterize distributions of model outputs, including energy return on investment (EROI) and net global warming potential (GWP). Results reveal that only the Gulf of Mexico configuration has any likelihood of achieving both net energy production (probability of EROI 0 = 6%), but the probability of achieving both together is very low (5%). The other two locations exhibit net positive energy production (EROI 1), but not net negative carbon sequestration. These results call into question the feasibility of the modeled A-BECCS system as an energy-producing NET and offer insights into possible system reconfiguration. For example, anaerobic digestion offers very low EROI and creates multiple carbon-bearing waste streams, which strongly undercuts overall net CO2 sequestration. Finally, it is observed that enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strongly contributes to net-energy production (EROI > 1) in the modeled A-BECCS system, but also strongly undercuts net CO2 sequestration, which is arguably the main goal of any NET. This analysis showcases how geographically-explicit analysis can advance our understanding of biomass-based NETs.",,,,,,,,,25,2,0,0,4,0,26,,,0196-8904,1879-2227,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Virginia, Dept Engn Syst & Environm, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",,,,2021-01-18,WOS:000603318800001,,

The Hutton Sandstone (Cooper-Eromanga Basin) - a prolific oil and gas producer known to have good reservoir quality and high reservoir volume - was recently tested for its geothermal potential in the Cooper Region. However, recent exploratory drilling did not produce the anticipated flow rates, raising the question of the impact of diagenesis on the reservoir quality of this sedimentary formation. The combined characterization of the petrology, diagenesis and petrophysical properties of the Hutton Sandstone at Celsius-1 and other surrounding wells indicates variable reservoir properties in the Cooper Region. This integrated study demonstrates that low formation permeability occurs at geothermal target depth and explains the negligible flow rates obtained at Celsius-1. These low permeabilities are the results of the preservation of widespread detrital clayey matrix and the extensive occurrence of authigenic kaolinite, illite and silica cements at the top and base of the Hutton Sandstone. This aspect is confirmed by NMR T-2 transversal relaxation time becoming shorter at similar depths. Petrography analysis also reveals that sandstones are affected by diagenetic processes of the eogenetic and mesogenetic phases.

A tidal river along a near-shore city should be evaluated and regulated from a multidisciplinary point of view, focused especially on ecology, in order to maintain and enhance the ecological structure and function of the river. Firstly, eco-hydrodynamic control can be used, based on simulated modeling of tidal water circulation, to trace the distribution of pollutants and to predict circulation of tidal water. Using findings from this modeling effort, some water control facilities, such as additional channel connection and water gates, can be established. Appropriate operation strategy is to use tidal energy to promote effective water exchange in the water bodies and thereby improve water quality in the tidal river. Secondly, ecological engineering methods should be integrated with hydraulic measures to further improve the environment. Appropriate plant communities for this ecological engineering can be selected. Based on the simulated results of eco-hydrodynamic model, the optimum locations for adding reclaimed land can be determined. These ecological engineering methods are as follows: (1) it is necessary to calculate the ecological water requirements for the tidal river. The water effluent from the sewage treatment plant can be considered as reclaimed water and pumped to upstream of the tidal reach for reuse; (2) well planned aquatic plant systems composed of emergent, floating, and submergent plants can be used to promote water treatment; (3) the configuration of the engineered landscape should give preference to indigenous plants and appropriate non-indigenous plant species; (4) constructed wetlands, especially mangroves at coastal city sites, can also improve the tidal river aquatic environment.

PCR-RFLP analysis of 16S rDNA partial fragments was used as a screening tool for reducing the number of isolates during diversity studies, obtaining 42 strains with different fingerprint patterns. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that they were affiliated to 19 different genera of Gamma- and Alpha-Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Some of them showed an efficient phenanthrene degradation by HPLC (between 83% and 97%) and surfactant production (between 40% and 55%). They could be an alternative for microbial selection in the degradation of PAHs in this estuarine system. In order to detect and monitor PAH-degrading bacteria in this highly productive area, rDNA amplicons of the 33 isolates, produced by PCR real time, were tested by the high-resolution melting (HRM) technique. After analyzing the generated melting curves, it was possible to accurately distinguish nine patterns corresponding to eight different genera. HRM analysis allowed a differentiation at the species level for genera Pseudomonas, Halomonas and Vibrio. The implementation of this method as a fast and sensitive scanning approach to identify PAH-degrading bacteria, avoiding the sequencing step, would mean an advance in bioremediation technologies.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,0959-3330,1479-487X,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Nacl Invest & Desarrollo Pesquero INIDEP, Paseo Victoria Ocampo 1, RA-7600 Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, ArgentinaInst Anal, Area Biol Mol Fares Taie, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, ArgentinaConsejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, ArgentinaComis Nacl Energia Atom, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Inst Anal,,,2019-03-28,WOS:000461528800005,29261428,

Analysis using energy systems models indicate that carbon capture and storage is a key technology for the UK to achieve its mitigation targets at lowest cost. There is potential to significantly improve upon the representation of the CO2 storage systems used in these models, but sensitivities of a given reservoir system to future development pathways must be evaluated. To investigate this we generate a range of numerical simulations of CO2 injection into the Bunter Sandstone of the UK Southern North Sea, considered to be one of the most important regional aquifers for CO2 storage. The scenarios investigate the sensitivity of CO2 storage to characteristics of regional development including number of injection sites and target rates of CO2 injection. This enables an evaluation of the impact of a range of deployment possibilities reflecting the range of scenarios that may be explored in an energy system analysis. The results show that limitations in achieving target injection rates are encountered at rates greater than 2 MtCO(2)/year-site due to local pressure buildup. The areal location of injection sites has minimal impact on the results because the Bunter Sandstone model has good regional connectivity. Rather, the depth of the site is the most important factor controlling limits on CO2 injection due to the relationship between the limiting pressure and the lithostatic pressure gradient. The potential for model simplification is explored by comparison of reservoir simulation with analytical models of average reservoir pressure and near-site pressure. The numerical simulations match average pressure buildup estimated with the closed-box analytical model of Zhou et al. (2008) over a 50 year injection period. The pressure buildup at individual sites is estimated using the Mathias et al. (2011) formulation and compared to the simulation response. Discrepancies in the match are mostly due to the interaction of signals from multiple injection sites and heterogeneous permeability in the numerical simulations. These issues should be the focus of further development of simplified models for CO2 storage in an energy systems analysis framework.",,,,,,,,,10,1,0,0,0,0,11,,,1750-5836,1878-0148,,,,,,,,,,"Imperial Coll London, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London SW7 2AZ, EnglandImperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 2AZ, EnglandImperial Coll London, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, London SW7 2AZ, EnglandLyell Ctr, Res Ave South, Edinburgh EH14 4AP, Midlothian, ScotlandBritish Geol Survey, Environm Sci Ctr, Keyworth NG12 5GG, Notts, England",Lyell Ctr,,,2017-10-01,WOS:000412457800012,,

Additionally, the harvested CCs could be used as substrate in an anaerobic digestion (AD) plant. This paper aims at assessing the environmental and economic consequences of planting rye as a winter CC (after maize) and its use as co-substrate in an AD plant (Rye scenario) instead of leaving the land fallow during winter and use solely maize for co-digestion with manure (NoRye scenario). The life cycle assessment (LCA) of 1 MJ of produced bioenergy (36% electricity and 64% heat) shows significant benefits for marine eutrophication for the Rye scenario due to reductions in nitrate leaching. However, the lower specific yield of rye and the biogas potential for the Rye scenario resulted in higher total impacts on climate change and resource depletion (higher use of machinery and infrastructures for 1 MJ of produced bioenergy), as compared to the use of maize in the NoRye scenario. Based on the analysis, possible methodological improvements are highlighted, in particular for the simulation of field emissions and regionalization of impacts. From an economic point-of-view, planting rye during winter could generate additional revenues for the farmer. However, the calculation incorporates large uncertainties, linked mainly to price volatility, seasonal weather conditions (and related yield variations), and to the possible influence of CCs on the summer crop yield. In conclusion, this paper presents a first overview of the sustainability performances of using rye as a CC for energy purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Reducing first cost by increasing specific power requires increased levels of gas turbine firing temperature and rotational speed and hence stresses. Improving fuel efficiency requires increases in gas turbine firing temperature and pressure ratio. Both these drivers are placing increasing demands on materials, especially the hot turbine section materials. Unlike Aero Engine turbines which operate on a single fuel and generally in clean air environments, industrial gas turbines may operate in dirty industrial or marine environments and have to cope with a wide range of both gaseous and liquid fuels which may contain corrosive contaminants. When this is coupled with the typical operating regime of an industrial gas turbine requiring continuous operation at or near full load conditions, the impact on hot section component lives can be considerable and the selection of appropriate materials, coating systems and allowable operating conditions is of prime importance. The approach to material and coating system evaluation and selection taken by ALSTOM Power in designing and lifing the range of small Industrial Gas Turbines is described. In particular, the design and life prediction of hot section components using a common methodology is illustrated by outlining the approach for a first stage turbine blade.

Effective interpretation leads to appreciation of underwater cultural heritage sites as links to our past, rather than simply as mines of 'treasure' to be salvaged for personal gain or sites of interest to be consumed by tourists. This paper describes a selection of interpreted maritime sites from the continental US (with specific reference to Florida), the Caribbean, and the Pacific to show how archaeological tourism, specifically shipwreck preserves and heritage trails, can begin to change mindsets, engage emotions, and inform visitors. It also discusses ways in which we can improve upon assessment, monitoring, and long-term preservation strategies after the trails are created and the sand has settled.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,0,13,,,1465-5187,1753-5530,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Publ Archaeol Network, 207 East Main St, Pensacola, FL 32502 USAEast Carolina Univ, Program Maritime Studies, Greenville, NC USA",Florida Publ Archaeol Network,,,2015-08-01,WOS:000382255400002,,

The proposed cyber interconnection scheme features cheap underwater sensor nodes with energy harvesting capability, a fleet of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for information ferrying, advanced magnetic-induction (MI) antenna design using ferrite material, distributed algorithms for efficient data collection via AUVs, and secure data delivery protocols. The success of this project will help push the frontier of Internet of Things in Oceans (IoTO) and OBD, both of which will find numerous underwater applications in offshore oil spill response, fisheries management, storm preparedness, etc., which impact the economy and well-being of not only coastal regions but also inland states.

The DEUS project provides a viable cyber interconnection scheme that enables distributed, efficient, ubiquitous, and secure data delivery in underwater environment via four synergistic thrusts: (1) integration of underwater wireless sensor and communication systems, which will enhance the current MI and light communication means of underwater sensors, integrate acoustic transmission systems for long-range communications between anchor nodes and AUVs, and design energy harvesting and replenishment solutions to prolong the lifetime of underwater sensors (30+ years); (2) distributed and ubiquitous data delivery via multiple AUVs, which aims to collect the distributed data and deliver them ubiquitously throughout the underwater network by employing ferrite material and triaxial induction antennas and mounting them outside of the AUV body for MI enhancement, and developing algorithms of multiple AUVs' path-planning, trajectory optimization, etc. under dynamic network conditions; (3) efficiency and security in data delivery, which designs network algorithms to improve the efficiency and security of data delivery. Instead of collecting data from every sensor via acoustic communications, the AUVs choose some sensors to collect data with the high data rate transmission mode in near field (e.g., light), and allowing the sensor far away from the AUVs to send its data either directly to AUVs via acoustic wave or to its nearby chosen sensors via MI/light communications.

Carbon storage is influenced by processes and properties that affect soil aggregation, such as clay and silt concentrations and mineralogy, intensity and frequency of wet/dry cycles, and microbial activity. Microbial activity, in turn, is influenced by factors such as temperature, nutrient and water availability, and residue quality. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of average annual maximum temperature on soil carbon storage in Vertosols under cotton-based farming systems. This paper reports a re-evaluation of results obtained from a series of experiments on cotton-farming systems conducted in eastern Australia between 1993 and 2010. The experimental sites were in the Macquarie and Namoi Valleys of New South Wales, and the Darling Downs and Central Highlands of Queensland. Average soil organic carbon storage in the 0-0.6m depth was highest in a Black Vertosol in Central Queensland and lowest in a Grey Vertosol that was irrigated with treated sewage effluent at Narrabri. At other sites, average values were generally comparable and ranged from 65 to 85 t C/ha. Climatic parameters such as ambient maximum temperature, T-max, and rainfall at rainfed sites (but not irrigated sites) were also related to soil organic carbon storage. At most sites, variations in carbon storage with average ambient maximum temperature were described by Gaussian models or bell-shaped curves, which are characteristic of microbial decomposition. Carbon storage occurred at peak rates only for a very limited temperature range at any one site, with these temperatures increasing with decreasing distance from the equator. The exception was a site near Narrabri that was irrigated with treated sewage effluent, where the relationship between soil organic carbon and T-max was linear. The decrease or absence of change in soil carbon storage with time reported in many Australian studies of annual cropping systems may be due to carbon storage occurring within a limited temperature range, whereas intra-seasonal average maximum temperatures can range widely. Further research needs to be conducted under field conditions to confirm these observations.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,,,1836-0947,1836-5795,,,,,,,,,,"NSW Dept Primary Ind, Australian Cotton Res Inst, Narrabri, NSW 2390, Australia",,,,2014-02-05,WOS:000329871700012,,

Recognition of coastal wetlands as a significant contributor to carbon storage (blue carbon) has generated interest into the climate change mitigation benefits of restoring or recreating saltmarsh habitat. However, the length of time a re-created marsh will take to become functionally equivalent to a natural (reference) system, or indeed, whether reference conditions are attainable, is largely unknown. Here, we describe a combined field chronosequence and modelling study of saltmarsh carbon accumulation and provide empirically based predictions of changes in the carbon sequestration rate over time following saltmarsh restoration. Carbon accumulation was initially rapid (average 1.04 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first 20 years), slowing to a steady rate of around 0.65 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) thereafter. The resulting increase in C stock gave an estimated total C accumulation of 74 t C ha(-1) in the century following restoration. This is approximately the same as our observations of natural marsh C content (69 t C ha(-1)), suggesting that it takes approximately 100 years for restored saltmarsh to obtain the same carbon stock as natural sites.",,,,,,,,,32,1,0,0,21,0,33,,,1744-9561,1744-957X,,,,,,,,,,"Environm Ctr Wales, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Deiniol Rd, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales",,,,2019-01-01,WOS:000465402800005,30907701,

The reflectance values of each band of LISS IV satellite data and the vegetation indices, viz., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), and transformed difference vegetation index (TDVI), derived from the satellite data, were correlated with the AGB. OSAVI showed the strongest positive linear relationship with the AGB and hence carbon content of the stand.

The nature of the crust underlying the Bay of Bengal is oceanic south of 15 degrees N, but remains unknown (thinned continental crust, serpentinized mantle or oceanic crust) north of this limit. In order to better define the nature of the crust in the northern Bay of Bengal, three wide-angle reflection seismic and refraction profiles were acquired during the multichannel seismic reflection Bengal cruise. Nine ocean-bottom seismometers were deployed alternatively on three profiles. A seismic source consisting of 64 air guns with a volume of 6180 in(3) was used simultaneously with a 10.05-km long streamer to acquire both seismic reflection and refraction data. Tomographic and forward modelings of the three refraction profiles reveal a 20-km thick crust north of the Bengal delta front beneath a minimum of 13 km thick sedimentary cover. The crust thins to about 10 km immediately south of the EW trending delta front and the thickness of sediments reaches a minimum of 7 km. Crustal velocities and velocity gradients are consistent with a continental origin of the crust in this area. At the base of the crust, high seismic velocities (>7.2 km/s) are interpreted as magmatic underplating. Wideangle seismic reflection and refraction data cannot resolve the nature of the upper 4-5 km of crust (oceanic crust, exhumed mantle or thinned continental crust). But coincident seismic reflection profiles show the emplacement of a volcanic intrusion, sills and some seaward dipping reflectors (SDRs) located close to the northern prolongation of the Ninety East ridge before 70 Ma (Maastrichtian). However, most of the fan-shaped reflectors identified in the northern Bay of Bengal are synrift features. We conclude that the crust in the northern Bay of Bengal is thinned continental crust intruded by volcanic products with the presence of a minor amount of underplating material at its base. Such a crustal structure probably extends from the northern Bay of Bengal (19 degrees N) to the Shillong Plateau (25 degrees N). These new findings are critical for the oil and gas exploration presently very active in the northern Bay of Bengal area. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The TGCA is the most active region in research and operation of carbon capture, utilization, and storage, with the largest technically accessible resource of CO2 storage, in the United States. The results suggest that dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration and pH, better than Cl concentration (or total dissolved solids), can be indicators for leakage detection in the TGCA; DIC has earlier detection time than pH. The modeling results show that detection of CO2 leakage in the shallow aquifers may take hundreds of years because of the confining unit in the TGCA, suggesting that (1) monitoring wells should be placed as deep as possible and (2) characterization of confining units in the overlying aquifer system is critical. Regional hydraulic gradient and groundwater pumping in the TGCA are important factors for monitoring well placement.

This limits the potential to both predict change in SOC stocks in temperate Australia and to identify where and how SOC stocks can be managed to mitigate climate change. Based on data from 707 sites, we examine variations in SOC concentrations and stocks across a range of natural temperate broadleaf forests in south-eastern Australia. Comparisons with current Australia-wide databases highlight previous underestimation of forest SOC concentrations, leading to substantial underprediction of SOC stocks in the most productive forests (e.g. this study's mean of 207 Mg C ha(-1) compared with a database mean estimate of 141 Mg C ha(-1) for Tall open-forests to 30-cm soil depth). Random Forest models involving 27 environmental variables (representing climate, terrain, parent material, soil attributes, vegetation, and fire history) explained up to 79% of the variation in SOC concentrations and 77% of the variation in SOC stocks to 30-cm depth. Climate variables (precipitation, temperature) were of greatest importance to the prediction of both SOC concentrations and SOC stocks, tending to override the importance of terrain and fire-history variables at this study's regional scale. While patterns in SOC concentrations and stocks were correlated, SOC concentrations were not a reliable proxy for SOC stocks to 10-cm depth, reiterating the importance of mass equivalent measures (i.e. soil bulk density) to assessing changes in soil carbon storage.

It is now affordable for oil and gas companies, fishing industry, militaries, and marine researchers to deploy physical undersea sensor systems to obtain strategic advantages. However, these sensing activities are scattered, isolated, and often follow the traditional deploy, wait, retrieve, and post-process routine. Since transmitting information underwater remains difficult and unreliable, these sensors lack a cyber interconnection, which severely limits ocean cyber-physical systems. This project aims to providing a viable cyber interconnection scheme that enables distributed, efficient, ubiquitous, and secure (DEUS) data delivery from underwater sensors to the surface station. The proposed cyber interconnection scheme features cheap underwater sensor nodes with energy harvesting capability, a fleet of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for information ferrying, advanced magnetic-induction (MI) antenna design using ferrite material, distributed algorithms for efficient data collection via AUVs, and secure data delivery protocols. The success of this project will help push the frontier of Internet of Things in Oceans (IoTO) and OBD, both of which will find numerous underwater applications in offshore oil spill response, fisheries management, storm preparedness, etc., which impact the economy and well-being of not only coastal regions but also inland states. The project will also provide special interdisciplinary training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, particularly women and minority students, through both research work and related courses on underwater wireless communication, network security, and AUV designs. The DEUS project provides a viable cyber interconnection scheme that enables distributed, efficient, ubiquitous, and secure data delivery in underwater environment via four synergistic thrusts: (1) integration of underwater wireless sensor and communication systems, which will enhance the current MI and light communication means of underwater sensors, integrate acoustic transmission systems for long-range communications between anchor nodes and AUVs, and design energy harvesting and replenishment solutions to prolong the lifetime of underwater sensors (30+ years); (2) distributed and ubiquitous data delivery via multiple AUVs, which aims to collect the distributed data and deliver them ubiquitously throughout the underwater network by employing ferrite material and triaxial induction antennas and mounting them outside of the AUV body for MI enhancement, and developing algorithms of multiple AUVs' path-planning, trajectory optimization, etc. under dynamic network conditions; (3) efficiency and security in data delivery, which designs network algorithms to improve the efficiency and security of data delivery. Instead of collecting data from every sensor via acoustic communications, the AUVs choose some sensors to collect data with the high data rate transmission mode in near field (e.g., light), and allowing the sensor far away from the AUVs to send its data either directly to AUVs via acoustic wave or to its nearby chosen sensors via MI/light communications. A secure data delivery scheme will also be developed to not only secure the data delivery against typical malicious attacks and guarantee the integrity of collected data, but also allow the data aggregation of one business entity without knowing others' private business information; (4) experimental validation and testing, which will verify the proposed data delivery schemes, and quantitatively present the performance gains through simulations, experiments and field test, based on existing facilities.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1646607,,,,,,,,University of Houston,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13725682,,

The optimized parameters were 53.75% H3PO4 concentration, 519.8 degrees C of carbonization temperature and 2.3h of activation time, which resulted in 857.93m(2)/g of BET surface area. The performance of CO2 adsorption was investigated for modified and virgin SMAC.

The effects of adsorption parameters such as activated carbon properties, type of amine used, gas flow rate and adsorbent dosage on breakthrough curves and adsorption bed capacity were evaluated. Reduction in BET surface area indicates that the amine-based chemicals were successfully attached on carbon surface and thus blocked most of the pores on the SMAC particles. The modified surface of SMAC with AMP amine showed the best performance in CO2 adsorption and regeneration with adsorption bed capacity of 23.05 mg(CO2)/g sorbent.

Because of the increasing need for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) in oil and gas projects in the Persian Gulf for doing operations such as inspection of offshore jackets, subsea pipelines, and submarine cables, and also pre-installation survey and post-laid survey of submarine pipelines and cables, design and construction of SROV was developed in Sharif University of Technology, and at the design stage behavior of the underwater vehicles was studied. In this paper an efficient dynamic simulation algorithm is developed for an UUV equipped with In manipulators so that each of them has N degrees of freedom. In addition to the effects of the mobile base, the various hydrodynamic forces exerted on these systems in an underwater environment are also incorporated into the simulation. The effects modeled in this work are added mass, viscous drag, fluid acceleration, and buoyancy forces. For drag forces, the emphasis here is on the modeling of the pressure drag. Recent advances in underwater position and velocity sensing enable real-time centimeter-precision position measurements of underwater vehicles. With these advances in position sensing, our ability to precisely control the hovering and low-speed trajectory of an underwater vehicle is limited principally by our understanding of the vehicle's dynamics and the dynamics of the bladed thrusters commonly used to actuate dynamically positioned marine vehicles. So the dynamics of thrusters are developed and an appropriate mapping matrix dependent on the position and orientation of the thrusters on the vehicle is used to calculate resultant forces and moments of the thrusters on the center of gravity of the vehicle. It should be noted that hull-propeller and propeller-propeller interactions are considered in the modeling too. Finally, the results of the simulations, for an underwater vehicle equipped with 1 two degrees of freedom manipulator are presented and discussed in detail.",,,,,23rd International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering23rd International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering,"JUN 20-25, 2004JUN 20-25, 2004","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Artic Engn Div; Univ British ColumbiaASME, Ocean, Offshore & Artic Engn Div; Univ British Columbia","Vancouver, CANADAVancouver, CANADA",6,0,0,0,0,0,7,,,0892-7219,1528-896X,,,,,,,,,,"Iran Marine Ind Co SADRA, Dept Engn, Mech Engn Div, Tehran 14678, IranAmirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran 158754413, IranSharif Univ Technol, Ctr Excellence Design Robot & Automat, Tehran 113659567, Iran",Iran Marine Ind Co SADRA,,,2006-05-01,WOS:000237683800005,,

The breakup of continents is commonly preceded by a long period of stretching, during which the continental crust is thinned and sediments accumulate in thick piles which may become future sources of oil and gas. During the last decade, researchers have discovered that, at least in some places, the nature of this stretching changes dramatically when the crust becomes thinner than 8-10 km. The top few kilometers of the crust are brittle, and initially stretch by movement along steeply dipping faults, but once this thickness threshold is crossed, the extension is instead accommodated on faults that are close to horizontal. This type of behaviour is also seen in other geological settings, such in the western United States, where the crust may be unusually weak, and close to volcanic mid-ocean ridges. The best-studied example of such behaviour is off the west coast of the Iberian peninsula. In such locations, faults lying deep beneath the seafloor can be seen in images derived from sound waves / the 'seismic reflection' technique. The application of this technique has revealed beneath the broken, fractured brittle crust the presence of a sub-horizontal fault covering an area of at least 1000 square kilometers (the size of the West Midlands) that was active when Iberia broke away from Newfoundland over 100 million years ago. Such faults can have very complicated shapes and interactions with the broken crustal blocks above, and because the existing images are just along a series of lines several kilometers apart, it is very difficult to work out how the fault moved. We will solve this problem by collecting a series of very closely spaced seismic reflection images that can be combined on a computer into a three-dimensional picture. This approach has been widely used by the oil industry in areas thought to contain economically viable oil and gas deposits, but never before to study the first order process of continental breakup itself. To make the most of the image, we will also collect another type of seismic data that allows us to work out how the speed of sound varies beneath the seafloor and hence what type of rocks may be present. As well us providing a detailed picture of how this particular pair of continents broke apart, the experiment will provide the most detailed and complete image ever of a large fault surface, and reveal how this fault and other more steeply-dipping faults above it have moved over millions of years. These observations will help us to understand more generally how the crust stretches and how large faults work.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/E016502/1,,,,,,,,University of Southampton,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15365172,,

We report high precision atmospheric measurements of CH4 and ethane (C2H6) within and downwind of the PBOF. Biogenic CH4 emissions, due to methanogenic processes within the Arctic tundra, are not co-emitted with C2H6. We show that the thermogenic gas emanating from oil and gas extraction point sources contains on average 1 mol of C2H6 for every 16 mol of CH4. We use a mass balance approach to estimate total emissions of thermogenic CH4 from two days in the summer of 2016 and find 2-5 times greater emissions than the sum of all sources in the PBOF reported to the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program in 2016.

Furthermore, the recent series of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in strong damages to many installed platforms. These occurrences and climate changes in several areas, all over the world, are a strong motivation for the development of new concepts and new criteria for offshore platforms. New platform concepts, with hulls similar to cylinder trunks and/or cones with shallow drafts, were proposed to the technical community, the goals of which were to respond to small motion in waves. This paper focuses on the study of the motions in waves of the Brazilian conception, MONOBR and its use exposed to severe environmental conditions. Experimental results obtained on the LabOceano (COPPE/UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro) developed in the past few years are presented.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,0952-8091,1741-5047,,,,,,,,,,"Petrobras SA, CENPES, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilUniv Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPE, Grad Sch Engn, Ocean Engn Program, Rio de Janeiro, BrazilUniv Sao Paulo, DENO, Sao Paulo, BrazilSolido Engenharia, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Solido Engenharia,,,2012-01-01,WOS:000422474900005,,

J,,,,,,,,,Timothy Reston,,Continental extension leading to breakup: determining the 3D structure of the west Galicia rifted margin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 31 2013,2013,"It has been widely accepted since the 1960s that the Earth's continental landmasses are not fixed, and that over periods of millions of years continents can separate and coalesce, for that for example the landmasses that make up the United Kingdom were once joined to Greenland and North America. The breakup of continents is commonly preceded by a long period of stretching, during which the continental crust is thinned and sediments accumulate in thick piles which may become future sources of oil and gas. During the last decade, researchers have discovered that, at least in some places, the nature of this stretching changes dramatically when the crust becomes thinner than 8-10 km. The top few kilometers of the crust are brittle, and initially stretch by movement along steeply dipping faults, but once this thickness threshold is crossed, the extension is instead accommodated on faults that are close to horizontal. This type of behaviour is also seen in other geological settings, such in the western United States, where the crust may be unusually weak, and close to volcanic mid-ocean ridges. The best-studied example of such behaviour is off the west coast of the Iberian peninsula. In such locations, faults lying deep beneath the seafloor can be seen in images derived from sound waves / the 'seismic reflection' technique. The application of this technique has revealed beneath the broken, fractured brittle crust the presence of a sub-horizontal fault covering an area of at least 1000 square kilometers (the size of the West Midlands) that was active when Iberia broke away from Newfoundland over 100 million years ago. Such faults can have very complicated shapes and interactions with the broken crustal blocks above, and because the existing images are just along a series of lines several kilometers apart, it is very difficult to work out how the fault moved. We will solve this problem by collecting a series of very closely spaced seismic reflection images that can be combined on a computer into a three-dimensional picture. This approach has been widely used by the oil industry in areas thought to contain economically viable oil and gas deposits, but never before to study the first order process of continental breakup itself. To make the most of the image, we will also collect another type of seismic data that allows us to work out how the speed of sound varies beneath the seafloor and hence what type of rocks may be present. As well us providing a detailed picture of how this particular pair of continents broke apart, the experiment will provide the most detailed and complete image ever of a large fault surface, and reveal how this fault and other more steeply-dipping faults above it have moved over millions of years. These observations will help us to understand more generally how the crust stretches and how large faults work.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/E015883/1,,,,,,,,University of Birmingham,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15358108,,

Carbon storage in the ocean as bicarbonate ions (by increasing ocean alkalinity) has received very little attention. Yet recent work suggests sufficient capacity to sequester copious quantities of CO2. It may be possible to sequester hundreds of billions to trillions of tons of C without surpassing postindustrial average carbonate saturation states in the surface ocean. When globally distributed, the impact of elevated alkalinity is potentially small and may help ameliorate the effects of ocean acidification. However, the local impact around addition sites may be more acute but is specific to the mineral and technology. The alkalinity of the ocean increases naturally because of rock weathering in which >1.5mol of carbon are removed from the atmosphere for every mole of magnesium or calcium dissolved from silicate minerals (e.g., wollastonite, olivine, and anorthite) and 0.5 mol for carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite and dolomite). These processes are responsible for naturally sequestering 0.5 billion tons of CO2 per year. Alkalinity is reduced in the ocean through carbonate mineral precipitation, which is almost exclusively formed from biological activity. Most of the previous work on the biological response to changes in carbonate chemistry have focused on acidifying conditions. More research is required to understand carbonate precipitation at elevated alkalinity to constrain the longevity of carbon storage. A range of technologies have been proposed to increase ocean alkalinity (accelerated weathering of limestone, enhanced weathering, electrochemical promoted weathering, and ocean liming), the cost of which may be comparable to alternative carbon sequestration proposals (e.g., $20-100 tCO(2)(-1)). There are still many unanswered technical, environmental, social, and ethical questions, but the scale of the carbon sequestration challenge warrants research to address these.",,,,,,,,,173,8,0,0,53,1,185,,,8755-1209,1944-9208,,,,,,,,,,"Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff, S Glam, WalesUniv Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford, England",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000413536800002,,

However, afforestation also changes the reflective properties of the surface vegetation from more reflective pasture to relatively less reflective forest cover. This increase in radiation absorption by the forest constitutes an increase in radiative forcing, with a warming effect. The net effect of decreased albedo and carbon storage on radiative forcing depends on the relative magnitude of these two opposing processes.We used data from an intensively studied site in New Zealand's Central North Island that has long-term, ground-based measurements of albedo over the full short-wave spectrum from a developing Pinus radiata forest. Data from this site were supplemented with satellite-derived albedo estimates from New Zealand pastures. The albedo of a well-established forest was measured as 13% and pasture albedo as 20 %. We used these data to calculate the direct radiative forcing effect of changing albedo as the forest grew.We calculated the radiative forcing resulting from the removal of carbon from the atmosphere as a decrease in radiative forcing of -104 GJ tC(-1) yr(-1). We also showed that the observed change in albedo constituted a direct radiative forcing of 2759 GJ ha(-1) yr(-1). Thus, following afforestation, 26.5 tC ha(-1) needs to be stored in a growing forest to balance the increase in radiative forcing resulting from the observed albedo change. Measurements of tree biomass and albedo were used to estimate the net change in radiative forcing as the newly planted forest grew. Albedo and carbon-storage effects were of similar magnitude for the first four to five years after tree planting, but as the stand grew older, the carbon storage effect increasingly dominated. Averaged over the whole length of the rotation, the changes in albedo negated the benefits from increased carbon storage by 17-24 %.",,,,,,,,,67,1,0,0,42,2,72,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,,,,,,"Landcare Res, Palmerston North 4442, New ZealandLandcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New ZealandNIWA, Wellington, New ZealandScion, Rotorua, New Zealand",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000298580900014,,

Deposition of carcasses declined logarithmically with time after the original event. Since fresh carcasses were more likely to be removed between counts than older carcasses, persistence rates increased logarithmically over time. Scavenging appeared to be the primary cause of carcass removal, followed by burial in beach debris and sand. Along-shore transport was negligible.

We use deposition rates to model the accumulation of beached carcasses, accounting for further deposition subsequent to the original event.

S. Navy recovered USS Monitor's icon revolving gun turret from the Atlantic Ocean, successfully capping off a multi-year recovery of over 200 tons of artifacts from the wreck site of the Civil War ironclad. Since that time, NOAA and their partners at The Mariners' Museum (TMM) have undertaken a pioneering collaborative effort to promote the historical and cultural significance of this National Historical Landmark. Education and outreach initiatives form the backbone of this collaboration, including an award-winning exhibition and conservation laboratory at The Mariners' Museum, classroom initiatives, distance learning, and events and festivals around the country, all of which have introduced hundreds of thousands of people to the Monitor's story. The goals of this multi-pronged approach are to raise public awareness; encourage public involvement in resource protection; increase knowledge about maritime history, science, and technology; and expand ocean and climate literacy. This paper will examine the methods used by the partnership to achieve these goals and provide a template for best practices in maritime science and history education through a public-private partnership.The USS Monitor Center at The Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia, is the official repository for all artifacts recovered from the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary and associated archives, and it is the central hub of all outreach and education. This 63,500 square foot facility contains the award-winning Ironclad Revolution exhibit, including conserved artifacts, immersive multimedia experiences, and re-created ship interiors. The Monitor Center also houses the Batten Conservation Laboratory, a state-of-the-art marine artifact conservation facility staffed by a team of international experts. NOAA and TMM designed the lab for maximum visitor interplay by incorporating massive viewing platforms and windows into the lab, a series of live web cameras, and periodically offering behind-the-scenes tours. The regular transition of conserved artifacts from the lab into the gallery also allows for a dynamic visitor experience over time. The Monitor Center increases TMM's international profile and simultaneously promotes NOAA's objectives of public awareness of this precious national resource and increases the historical, cultural, and scientific knowledge of mankind's interaction with the ocean.NOAA continues to work with other regional organizations in an education and outreach capacity to tell the USS Monitor's story to a broader audience. These other partners, including the Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum, North Carolina Aquarium, and Civil War Naval Museum, ultimately engage and encourage the public to visit The Mariners' Museum for a deeper learning and entertainment experience. NOAA is also working with its partners to promote a USS Monitor Trail. Although still in development, this interactive tool will allow people to trace Monitor's story and history from Buffalo, NY to the Hudson Valley and all the way down the East Coast to Hampton Roads where Monitor battled the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia and ultimately to the ship's final resting place within the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary off Hatteras, NC. The Monitor Trail has the potential to link people who previously had little or no understanding of the ironclad to the key locations of the country responsible for transforming the Monitor from a series of conceptual sketches into the savior of the Union Navy and future of naval technology.TMM and NOAA are using other traditional and technologically advanced methods of education and outreach. Experts in the fields of history, science, conservation, and technology offer formal and informal educational programs to groups of all ages. Museum and sanctuary visitors, school systems, lifelong learning groups, and other sanctuary constituents are primary audiences. Distance learning is utilized to target groups outside of the region. A robust interactive video conferencing (IVC) facility allows TMM and NOAA to reach national and international audiences. To date, IVC programs have reached thousands of students in 29 states and 6 countries.Using the Monitor's historical significance as the entry point, NOAA and TMM are able to introduce concepts that transcend a single vessel or moment in time. While the primary purpose for recovering over 1,500 artifacts from the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary was to make Monitor's story accessible to the widest possible audience, it was never intended to be purely a maritime historical story. By pursuing an integrated and immersive educational and outreach experience, TMM and NOAA have pioneered a comprehensive approach to promote awareness and protection not only of the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary's natural and cultural resources, but also that of our nation's oceans.",,,,,MTS/IEEE Oceans ConferenceMTS/IEEE Oceans Conference,"OCT 14-19, 2012OCT 14-19, 2012",IEEE; Marine Technol Soc; IEEE Ocean Engn SocIEEE; Marine Technol Soc; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc,"Virginia Beach, VAVirginia Beach, VA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-4673-0829-8; 978-1-4673-0830-4,,,,,,,,,"Mariners Museum, USS Monitor Ctr, Newport News, VA 23606 USANatl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Monitor Natl Marine Sanctuary, Newport News, VA 23606 USA",Mariners Museum,,,2013-05-05,WOS:000315350300180,,

We assessed changes in vegetation composition and associated environmental gradients across seven drilling mud sumps in the Kendall Island Bird Sanctuary, Mackenzie Delta. Three decades after disturbance, drilling sumps had developed vegetation coverage equivalent to that in undisturbed areas, although bare soil persisted in ponded areas and where a salt crust was present. Vegetation on sumps was composed of communities dominated by forbs, grasses, and tall shrubs that were distinct from adjacent, undisturbed sedge and low shrub communities. The area of altered vegetation around a sump was generally larger in upland or saline environments than in lowland areas. Pooled water observed around many sumps was likely associated with thaw subsidence that occurred following construction, which was subsequently compounded by snow drifting and increased soil temperatures along the margins of the sump mound. Changes in drainage, active-layer depth, and surface salt concentrations appear to be key environmental factors that have helped shape plant communities established on drilling sumps in the three decades after disturbance.",,,,,,,,,36,0,4,0,24,0,45,,,0004-0843,1923-1245,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, CanadaIndian & No Affairs Canada, Div Water Resources, Yellowknife, NT X1A 2R3, Canada",Indian & No Affairs Canada,,,2008-06-01,WOS:000256894400009,,

Therefore, a semi-physics simulation training system of offshore drilling specifically designed for electrical engineers is addressed in this paper. To maintain high simulation fidelity, driller chairs and PLC controllers are copied and realized from field. Mathematical models are built to simulate both normal and fault state of the drilling control system. Different faults are realized by changing the setting parameters of model or switching between faulty models. Finally, with the help of virtual reality technology, the 3-D environment of drilling operation is realized to improve the vision performance. Moreover, an instructor station subsystem is designed to evaluate trainer's performance. Through this simulation training system, the electrical engineers can not only master drilling control system, but also improve the troubleshooting skill.

Natural gas production in the region presently ranks behind that of oil and coal. However, the abundance of gas could lead to a significant gas market share increase in the energy mix. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the total endowment of conventional gas in Asia Pacific. This is carried out with a Variable Shape Distribution (VSD) model that forecasts volumes in provinces that have not been previously evaluated. The endowment is then distributed across countries to show where volumes are most likely to be found. A breakdown between offshore versus onshore resources is also estimated. The results of the analysis show there is a significant gas endowment. The estimated distribution across countries and onshore/offshore areas provides insight into the relative economics of gas production, as well as a basis for potential investment decisions. With appropriate energy policies, it may be possible to tap the vast gas potential in Asia Pacific. Considering gas may be the most abundant, inexpensive, and clean fossil fuel, the outcome would be increased energy security and a low carbon economy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the population of T&T is relatively small; resulting in a CO2 emissions per capita ranking that is quite high. As such T&T is ranked 2nd to only Qatar in CO2 emissions per capita in 2009. This indicates that T&T should be concerned about its levels of CO2 emissions and should look at options to control and reduce its volume. In T&T, carbon dioxide (CO2) can be strategically placed in deep saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas reservoirs as a CO2 mitigation measure. Theoretical case studies have been performed on the British Petroleum's (bpTT) Mahogany field, off Trinidad's east coast. The migration of injected CO2 was analysed using the CMG-GEM reservoir simulation software [ 1]. Initial runs show that CO2 sequestration is technically feasible. However, uncertainty surrounds the economics of successfully undertaking a CO2 sequestering program. Given the time frame required to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of this mitigation measure, the traditional discounted cash flow (DCF) approach may not be suitable [ 2]. The real option valuation (ROV) method is often presented as an alternative to the DCF approach because it is able to quantify the additional asset value arising for flexible asset management.

The quaternary mixture of PAHs (phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, and benzo [a] pyrene) and metals (Cr, Ni, and Pb) spiked the soil, constructing a microcosm; the microcosms were bioaugmented with newly developed plant bacterial consortia (Cpm(1) and Cpm(2)). The microcosms were amended with biochar (sieved particle size 0.5-2 mm) as redox regulators to reduce oxidative stress of plant-microbe systems. To formulate the two plant-bacterial consortia, plant species were collected and bacteria were isolated from oil spill soil. The bacterial strains used in two formulated consortia includes - Cpm(1) (Enterobacter cloacae HS32, Brevibacillus reuszeri HS37, and Stenotrophomonas sp. HS16) and Cpm(2) (Acinetobacter junii HS29, Enterobacter aerogenes HS39 and Enterobacter asburiae HS22). The PAHs degradation and metal removal efficacy of the consortia (Cpm(1) and Cpm(2)) were studied after 24 weeks of trial. The physicochemical properties of microcosm's soil (M-2 and M-3) were assessed after experimentation, which resulted in the finding that the soil exhibits dropped in pH from basic to neutral after application of the plant microbes consortium. The electrical conductivity was lower in M-2 and M-3 soils, with a range between 1.60 and 1.80 mS/cm after the treatment. The Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) results illustrate how metabolites with the different molecular weight (M.W) were found in M-2 and M-3 soils (184-446), as a result of the plant-microbes mediated rhizodegradation of four spiked PAHs. The metals in microcosm's soil are very low in concentration after 24 weeks of trial when compared to control (M-1). The Cr, Ni and Pb removal percentages were found in 45.79, 42.19 and 44.85 in M-2. However, the removal percentages were found to be 45.41, 41.47 and 44.25 respectively for these same HMs in M-3 soil.

The methodology has been applied to the estuary of the Nalon River. For the evaluation of the tidal resource and determination of the optimum locations free license software is used to simulate a one-dimensional flow. In order to achieve this, a geometrical model of the river mouth using open source geographic data and nautical information has been built.

However, water use and carbon assimilation are difficult to quantify at the ecosystem scale. In this research, we investigate the application of eddy covariance in a 'belt and alley' system. Footprint modelling indicated that the proportion of the signal from the tree belts was similar to the proportion of tree belts in the ecosystem. Eddy covariance units were installed in two adjacent fields: one containing belts of four-year-old oil mallee Trees 10 m wide planted 60 m apart; and one containing agricultural crops. Tree belts had little impact on wind direction or its standard deviation for any measurement height, and stationarity, integral turbulence and energy balance closure were similar for the two fields. Persistent upward wind flows were observed for wind directions aligned with the tree belts, suggesting the possibility of advection. For our experimental site, removal of data for winds aligned with the tree belts had a negligible impact on fluxes of carbon dioxide and water. During summer and autumn, the field containing oil mallees used 27 mm more water, and assimilated 0.93 Mg CO2/ha more than the field without trees. Both daytime and night time CO2 fluxes were greater in magnitude for the oil mallee field than the control field during summer. Water use by the trees was lower than other fields in the region where herbaceous perennials had been grown, and also lower than other estimates based on sap flow measurements. Further research will be necessary to determine the impact of spatial variability of water use on groundwater recharge at the catchment scale. Extra carbon storage associated with tree belts may increase their economic attractiveness to farmers in the region, but the impact of respiration after summer rainfall requires further investigation.

We find that all climate metrics suggest a natural gas combined cycle plant offers life cycle climate benefits over 100 years compared to a pulverized coal plant, even if the life cycle methane leakage rate for natural gas reaches 5%. Over shorter time frames (i.e., 20 years), plants using natural gas with a 4% leakage rate have similar climate impacts as those using coal, but are no worse than coal. If carbon capture and sequestration becomes available for both types of power plants, natural gas still offers climate benefits over coal as long as the life cycle methane leakage rate remains below 2%. These results are consistent across climate metrics and the MAGICC model over a 100-year time frame. Although it is not clear whether any of these metrics are better than the others, the choice of metric can inform decisions based on different societal values. For example, whereas annual temperature change reported may be a more relevant metric to evaluate the human health effects of increased heat, the cumulative temperature change may be more relevant to evaluate climate impacts, such as sea-level rise, that will result from the cumulative warming.",,,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,9,0,44,,,1088-1980,1530-9290,,,,,,,,,,"Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15217 USACarnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15217 USA",,,,2017-08-01,WOS:000409310500005,,

Oil slick trajectories are controlled by prevailing winds and current eddies.

Especially, the border area was a venue for cross-border, among-region exchanges and conflicts. As the Maritime Province was registered as Russian territory, the Korean Peninsula and Russia were bordered by Tumen River. Russia restricted the rights of fishery and navigation by setting territorial waters of the Maritime Province. In modern times, the conflict on East Sea seemed to be reduced as Japan territorialized Sakhalin and colonized Korea after Russo-Japanese War, but the conflict was expressed again in the 1930s. The paper noted fishery and shipwreck of Hamgyeongbuk-do Province and the Maritime Province in 1936, right before the Sino-Japanese War. 1936 was just before the Sino-Japanese War, when the military conflict over the border peaked. The reason examining this period is because it show how Japan has unraveled its relations with Russia, which borders the Korean Peninsula. Russia claimed for the 12-mile limit of territorial waters, Japan claimed for the 3-mile limit of territorial waters, and the conflict on East Sea Rim fishery continued. Moreover, Japan caused the Manchurian Incident in 1931, and established Manchurian nation in 1932, escalating military conflict with Russia which was sharing the border. With more military facilities and soldiers deployed on a large scale along the border, Japan and Russia have devoted all its energy to gather intelligence on each other. During this period, there were frequent cases of fishing boats capture, and there were many cases in which the background of distress was suspicious. The problems of capture and distress of fishing boats in the 1930s were not just about fishery dispute, but about military intelligence gathering and vigilance between Japan and Russia.",,,,"환동해는 한국, 북한, 러시아, 중국, 일본, 미국이 이해 당사국으로 복잡한 근현대사를 노정해왔다. 특히 접경지역은 국가간, 지역간 교류의 장이자 갈등의 장이었다. 연해주가 러시아의 영토로 편입되면서 두만강을 둘러싸고 한반도와 러시아가 국경을 접하게 되었 다. 러시아는 연해주의 영해도 설정하여 어업권과 항해권에 영향을 미쳤다. 이 글에서는 1937년 중일전쟁 직전 시기의 한반도와 러시아의 영해와 공해에 주목해 보았다. 러시아는 영해 12해리를 주장했고, 일본은 영해 3해리를 주장하여 환동해 어업 은 갈등이 계속되었다. 게다가 1931년 일본이 만주사변을 일으키고, 1932년 만주국을 세 우면서 국경을 접하고 있던 러시아와 군사적 갈등이 고조 되었다. 국경에 군사시설이 늘어나고 군인들이 대규모로 배치되는 가운데, 일본과 러시아는 상대국에 대한 정보수집에 총력을 기울였다. 이 시기 어선 나포사건이 빈발했고, 조난 배 경이 의심스러운 사례도 많았다. 1930년대 어선의 나포와 조난어선의 문제는 단순한 어 업분쟁이 아니라 일본과 러시아의 군사적 정보수집과 경계와 관련한 것이었다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2093-8780,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-07,KJD:ART002591682,,

We evaluated the pore-fluid sensitivity of these attributes with both well-log and seismic data in Tertiary unconsolidated sediments from the Gulf of Mexico where sand and shale are the only expected lithologies. While the sensitivity of one attribute versus another to discriminate pore fluid is often debated in the literature, the sensitivities of the three attributes are not independent but can be traced back to the fluid factor, which is a function of the P- and S-wave normal-incident reflection coefficients. Interestingly, the fluid factor, which is a reflectivity attribute, at the top of a hydrocarbon-saturated reservoir, is basically independent of the shale properties above the reservoir. It is a function of the brine and hydrocarbon impedances of the reservoir. The next attribute, Poisson impedance, is thenequal to the fluid factor times the sum of the brine and hydrocarbon impedances. Finally, the lambda-rho attribute is equal to the Poisson impedance multiplied by the same impedance sum. Essentially, the same scale factor differentiates these attributes, which does not significantly affect the sensitivity of the attributes. PI is the basis of the sensitivity for these attributes. As a means of testing their sensitivity for predicting pore fluid, we generated the three attributes along with their statistical distributions for different pore fluids for 183 reservoirs. The well-log statistical descriptions were then used to calibrate the seismic amplitude in a 3D survey to reflectivity values, thus allowing pore-fluid classification schemes based on Bayes' decision rules. In essence, seismic-amplitude quantification was based on regional statistics rather than individual wells within the 3D seismic survey to delineate the portions of the reservoir that were saturated with oil, gas, or brine.",,,,,77th Annual International Meeting of the Society-of-Exploration-Geophysicists77th Annual International Meeting of the Society-of-Exploration-Geophysicists,"SEP 23-28, 2007SEP 23-28, 2007",Soc Explorat GeophysicistsSoc Explorat Geophysicists,"San Antonio, TXSan Antonio, TX",22,3,0,0,1,0,25,,,0016-8033,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Houston, Ctr Appl Geosci & Energy, Houston, TX USAGeokinetics Inc, Houston, TX USA",Geokinetics Inc,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000275247900005,,

These measurements were carried out from a fixed oilrig under open sea conditions in the Mediterranean Sea during the WInd and Salinity Experiment 2000 (WISE 2000). The SSE retrieval methodology uses quasi-simultaneous measurements of the radiance coming from the sea surface and the downwelling sky radiance, in addition to the sea surface temperature (SST). The radiometric data were acquired by a CIMEL ELECTRONIQUE CE 312 radiometer, with four channels placed in the 8-14 mum region. The sea temperature was measured with high-precision thermal probes located on oceanographic buoys, which is not exactly equal to the required SST. A study of the skin effect during the radiometric measurements used in this work showed that a constant bulk-skin temperature difference of 0.05+/-0.06 K was present for wind speeds larger than 5 m/s. Our study is limited to these conditions. Thus, SST used as a reference for SSE retrieval was obtained as the temperature measured by the contact thermometers placed on the buoys at 20-cm depth minus this bulk-skin temperature difference.SSE was obtained under several observation angles and surface wind speed conditions, allowing us to study both the angular and the sea surface roughness dependence.

For larger angles, the effect of double or multiple reflections on the sea surface produces discrepancies between measured and theoretical SSEs, and more complex models should be used to get accurate SSE values, such as the model of Wu and Smith [Wu, X., & Smith, W.L.

J,,,,,,,,,,,The Influence of Climate Change on Future Ocean Conditions: Implications for Offshore Renewable Energy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Nov 01 2020,2020,"In response to the global climate emergency, the UK has committed to becoming carbon-neutral by 2050 with Greater Manchester committing to an even more ambitious plan to become carbon-neutral by 2038. A major component of the carbon budget for both the UK and the Greater Manchester region is the electricity sector. As such, efforts are required to ensure electricity (both regionally and nationally generated) through sustainable means. The UK - an island nation surrounded by energetic waters and strong winds - has the potential to generate large proportions of its electricity through offshore renewable (ORE) technologies. As such, the UK already produces around 10% of its electricity from offshore wind with this number set to increase to 30% by 2030. Complimenting this 30% is an expected increase in contribution from nascent wave and tidal energy sectors.As the UK becomes increasingly reliant on ORE for its electricity, it becomes increasingly important to understand the harsh conditions they operate in; both from the perspective of survivability and expected energy yield. While ORE technologies are important for combatting climate change the conditions they must operate in are also subject to the effects of climate change. Significant uncertainty exists about future weather conditions. Key questions include:Will the severity and frequency of damaging storms increase? How do extreme events affect design decisions for future wind/wave energy devices? How will mean energy (wave, wind) levels change?How do these alter the effectiveness and suitability of existing ORE deployments? How does this affect the optimal locations, design and operation of future deployments?Can maintenance vessels safely operate in the predicted weather conditions and windows? How does this influence energy production?This project aims to assess the sensitivity, and uncertainty in performance, of current and future ORE deployments to the effects of climate change. Development of a UK-centred wave model will enable assessment of the predicted wind and wave conditions based on different climate scenarios. Reducing the uncertainty of the future conditions will facilitate improved design, reliability, and location choice for ORE; subsequently increasing the capacity factor (energy yield) and levelised cost of energy (LCOE). As such, this project pertains to the relevant EPSRC themes: Living With Environmental Change, Fluid Dynamics, and Water Engineering.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2481340,,,,,,,,University of Manchester,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15334827,,

This paper forms part of a wider study modelling tidal and wave processes, and planned renewable energy extraction, in PFOW using 3D hydrodynamic and spectral wave numerical models. Such hydrodynamic models require a number of spatial data, i.e. high resolution bathymetry, model boundary conditions and measurements for model validation, which are hard to obtain in extreme environments such as PFOW. This paper examines the characteristics and selection criteria of the data used for the development of the models. Most of these data are freely available, and could form part of an open source marine renewable energy hydrodynamic modelling toolbox.In order to include the planned tidal and wave energy developments in the hydrodynamic models of the wider study, realistic tidal and wave device array scenarios are required. However, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding the type of devices that will be deployed and device array layouts. Here, we describe the process undertaken, in consultation with industry, to develop a small number of generic device types and array scenarios for the PFOW, based on insight provided by documentation submitted by developers as part of the Scottish marine licensing process. For tidal developments, an algorithm was developed to determine the site specific array configuration, taking into account the number of turbines, water depth, tidal current direction and the spatial distribution of mean kinetic energy. The wave development sites did not require such detailed site specific placement of devices, and the generic layouts could simply be constructed in most cases without the need for detailed site specific resource characterisation.It is anticipated that the renewable energy industry will be able to adopt our data selection criteria to ensure models developed for environmental impact assessments satisfy the quality requirements of the regulator. Similarly, the methodologies developed for characterising generic device types and array layouts will be useful to academia and government researchers, who do not necessarily have access to detailed device and site specific information.

Effects on fishing success have been noted in a few studies indicating potential for temporary displacement of at least some fish populations. However (and as also indicated by other researchers) displacement through scaring of fish for a number of hours or a day should not, in perspective, pose a major problem. Adults, juveniles and eggs may also suffer immediate mortality within a few meters of a sound source. However it is sub lethal effects which are most difficult to deal with and serious physiological and anatomical damage may also be occurring at much greater depths in the field leading to a variety of injurious effects. There is virtually no information in this area and it needs to be addressed if only for assurance.Lobster is one of the most commercially important species in Atlantic Canada and it is important to have some knowledge on whether seismic poses a threat to lobster populations, and now more so, given recent interests for expanding seismic surveys in such areas, as the lobster rich and more shallow waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Some pilot studies have now been carried out in the laboratory and field investigating the potential for effects of seismic on lobster health. The basic thrust of the studies was to explore for changes in various biological endpoints and identify those (if any) which might then require further assessment in a more comprehensive manner. A number of endpoints were assessed in animals exposed to a 'low level exposure -202 dB peak-to-peak and a high level exposure -227 dB peak-to-peak. The endpoints included (a) lobster survival (b) food consumption (c) turnover rate (d) serum protein (e) serum enzymes and (f) serum calcium. A small histopathological study was also carried out on lobsters from 1 of the 5 trials. Observations were often made over a period of a few days to several months.Exposure of lobster to very high as well as low sound levels had no effects on delayed mortality or damage to mechanosensory systems associated with animal equilibrium and posture, as assessed by turnover rates. There was also no evidence for loss of legs or other appendages. However sub-lethal effects were observed with respect to feeding and serum biochemistry with effects sometimes being observed weeks to months after exposure. A histochernical change was also noted in the hepatopancreas of animals exposed 4 months previously, which may be linked to organ 'stress'. These initial studies were meant to be exploratory in nature and caution is warranted about over interpretation.

Currently, post-combustion CO2 capture is the most matured technology that is employed by most of the industries. This paper investigated the ways to enhance the CO2 capture ability of the ILs. For this purpose, two ionic liquids 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidiazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim](+)[BF4](-)) and 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidiazolium hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim](+)[PF6](-)) were selected and compared with conventional amine (MEA and MDEA) solvents. Experimental results showed that conventional amines have larger CO2 loadings as compared to both the ILs because of the reactive nature of amines with CO2. Therefore, it was proposed to prepare the blends of IL-Amine to exploit the reactive nature of amine combined with non-volatile nature of the ILs. It was observed that the [Bmim](+)[BF4](-) blends with amine, have high CO2 loading as compared to pure IL as well as aqueous amine solution. Further, it was found that maximum CO2 loading results for 80% [Bmim](+)[BF4](-) -20% MEA blend. Piperazine (PZ) was further added to the blend as the promoter and it significantly enhanced the CO2 loading. Finally, the kinetic studies of various blends were performed and the kinetic parameters were evaluated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Los Andosoles, a pesar de su escasa abundancia, son los suelos con la mayor capacidad de almacenar carbono debido a sus características mineralógicas. Los cambios en el carbono orgánico del suelo y los flujos de carbono en los bosques templados en México son el resultado de cambios locales, generados por las actividades humanas como el cambio de uso, el manejo forestal, los incendios, la regeneración y la sustitución de especies. El cambio de uso de suelo es uno de los principales factores que explican los flujos de carbono en estos ecosistemas, sin embargo, aún no existe evidencia clara de que sea en sentido negativo.

Measuring the impacts of the oil spill over the large and complex coast calls for the application of remote sensing techniques. This study develops a method for post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill monitoring of the damaged marsh vegetation using Landsat imagery. This study utilizes 10 years of Landsat data, from 2005 to 2014, to examine the longevity of the oil spill's impacts on the marsh vegetation. AVIRIS data collected between 2010 and 2012 are used to validate the Landsat results. Landsat imagery documents the significant effect of oiling on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the marsh vegetation in 2010 and 2011 (p < 0.01 in both cases). These results are corroborated by the AVIRIS data, which recorded the most severe impact in May 2011 followed by progressive recovery in October 2011 and October 2012. The Landsat imagery, combined with relevant environmental information and appropriate statistical tools, provides a robust and low-cost method for long-term post-oil spill monitoring of the marshes, revealing that the major aboveground impacts (at 30 m scale) of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on Louisiana salt marshes lasted for two years. The method presented is applicable for other hazardous events whenever pre-event referencing and long-term post-event monitoring are desired, thereby offering an effective and economical tool for disaster management.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,5,0,13,,,2072-4292,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maryland, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, 1426 Anim Sci Ag Engr Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,,,2017-06-01,WOS:000404623900038,,

However, the properties of the oils spilled into sea are influenced by external environmental conditions. In this study, we present a graphene-based (GB) sponge as a novel sorbent for crude oil removal and compare its performance with that of a commercial sorbent sheet under various environmental parameters. The GB sponge with excellent superhydrophobic and superoleophilic characteristics is demonstrated to be an efficient sorbent for crude oils, with high sorption capacity (up to 85-95 times its weight) and good reusability. The crude-oil-sorption capacity of our GB sponge is remarkably higher (about 4-5 times) than that of the commercial sheet and most other previously reported sponge sorbents. Moreover, several challenging environmental conditions were examined for their effects on the sorption performance, including the weathering time of oils, seawater temperature, and turbulence (wave effect). The results show that the viscosity of the oil increased with increasing weathering time or decreasing temperature; therefore, the sorption rate seemed to decrease with longer weathering times and lower temperatures. Turbulence can facilitate inner sorption and promote higher oil sorption. Our results indicate that the extent of the effects of weather and other environmental factors on crude oil should be considered in the assessment of the effective adsorption capacity and efficiency of sorbents. The present work also highlights the widespread potential applications of our GB sponge in marine spilled-oil cleanup and hydrophobic solvent removal. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Wastewater-affected mangrove forests were referred to as WAM and undisturbed areas as Non-WAM. Redox conditions and DC content were statistically correlated (P < 0.05) with seasonality and type of land use (WAM vs. Non-WAM). Eh values were from anoxic to oxic conditions in the wet season (from -5 to 68 mV in WAM and from <40 to >400 mV in Non-WAM soils) and significantly higher (from 66 to 411 mV) in the dry season (P < 0.01). OC contents (0-40 cm soil depth) were significantly higher (P < 0.01) in the wet season than the dry season, and higher in Non-WAM soils than in WAM soils (values of 8.1 and 6.7 kg m(-2) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, for Non-WAM, and values of 3.8 and 2.9 kg m(-2) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, for WAM soils; P < 0.01). Iron partitioning was significantly dependent (P < 0.05) on type of land use, with a smaller degree of pyritization and lower Fe-pyrite presence in WAM soils compared to Non-WAM soils. Basal respiration of soil sediments was significantly influenced (P < 0.01) by type of land use with highest CO2 flux rates measured in the WAM soils (mean values of 0.20 mg CO2 h(-1)-g(-1) C vs. 0.04 mg CO2 h(-1)-g(-1), C). The OC storage reduction in WAM soils was potentially caused (i) by an increase in microbial activity induced by loading of nutrient-rich effluents and (ii) by an increase of strong electron acceptors [e.g., NO3-] that promote a decrease in pyrite concentration and hence a reduction in soil OC burial. The current estimated OC stored in mangrove soils (0-40 cm) in the state of Ceara is approximately 1 million t. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Emissions to the atmosphere can be avoided by ceasing logging. Removals of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere can be increased by allowing forests to continue growing. However, the relative benefits for carbon storage of managing native forests for wood production versus protection are contested. Additionally, the potential for carbon storage is impacted upon by disturbance events, such as wildfire, that alter the amount and longevity of carbon stocks.Using a case study of montane ash forests in southeastern Australia, we demonstrated that the total biomass carbon stock in logged forest was 55% of the stock in old growth forest. Total biomass included above-and belowground, living and dead. Biomass carbon stock was calculated spatially as an average across the landscape, accounting for variation in environmental conditions and forest age distribution. Reduction in carbon stock in logged forest was due to 66% of the initial biomass being made into products with short lifetimes (<3 years), and to the lower average age of logged forest (, 50 years compared with >100 years in old growth forest). Only 4% of the initial carbon stock in the native forest was converted to sawn timber products with lifetimes of 30-90 years.Carbon stocks are depleted in a harvested forest system compared with an old growth forest, even when storage in wood products and landfill are included. We estimated that continued logging under current plans represented a loss of 5.56 Tg C over 5 years in the area logged (824 km(2)), compared with a potential gain of 5.18-6.05 TgC over 5 years by allowing continued growth across the montane ash forest region (2326 km(2)). Avoiding emissions by not logging native forests and allowing them to continue growing is therefore an important form of carbon sequestration. The mitigation value of forest management options of protection versus logging should be assessed in terms of the amount, longevity and resilience of the carbon stored in the forest, rather than the annual rate of carbon uptake.",,,,,,,,,81,10,0,0,58,0,93,,,2150-8925,,,,,,,,,,,"Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 0200, AustraliaGriffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Southport, Qld 4222, AustraliaFujitsu Labs Ltd, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2118588, Japan",,,,2014-08-15,WOS:000338925000009,,

Sakhalin Energy was profoundly influenced by international financial institutions' global rules related to environmental and indigenous people's interests. The benefit sharing arrangement that evolved under these influences resulted in enhanced procedural equity for indigenous people, but has not prevented conflict with and within communities.

Such techniques, however, have rarely been applied to waveform data recorded by ocean-bottom seismometers (OBSs). The data recorded by some OBSs are strongly influenced by site effects such as the existence of unconsolidated sediment layers. The resulting waveforms tend to have a monotone frequency so that the calculated CCs stay artificially high, and false delay times are obtained at certain multiples of the period. This effect also varies from place to place. To overcome such problems, CC measurements were first performed using multiple time windows with different lengths in order to reject unstable results. Station-specific CC thresholds were then objectively determined based on the CC distributions. This method was applied to seismic measurements obtained by OBSs deployed off the Kii Peninsula from 2003 to 2007 in order to identify characteristic hypocenter patterns. Two types of earthquake clusters were found. The first occurred within the oceanic mantle, and the component events were linearly aligned along the NNE direction. Such earthquakes are considered to occur on preexisting faults due to dehydration of the serpentinized mantle. The second type of cluster consisted of interplate earthquakes that occurred at the southern tip of the Kii Peninsula.

It is not only capable of handling severe effects of weather on drilling process but it also improves the efficiency of offshore drilling operations. In drilling operation, circulating drilling fluid (with particular density to maintain desired pressure in the well) is pumped in drill-string through choke valve, and it leaves through the drill bit, cools and lubricates the bit and the drill-string, and shifts the drilled cuttings to the surface of earth. Besides this normal operation, heave motion force drill-string to move it vertically up and down which introduces pressure deviations in mud pressure. These pressure fluctuations may damage the well. To mitigate the effect of heave motion, a controller is required to control choke valve in such a way that it regulates the desired mud pressure in the well, throughout the operation.

One objective is to determine statistically significant variables that influence the probability of HS&E incidence and reporting. Incidence modeling employs standard qualitative response models with binary and ordered dependent variables, and a Poisson specification. A second objective is to examine the impact of imperfect reporting on inferences. Unlike previous studies, models allowing for the possibility of imperfect reporting are specified and estimated. The results of this analysis provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis that aspects of well complexity and site complexity increase the likelihood of HS&E incidents in drilling. Equally important is evidence rejecting the hypothesis that broader oil company attributes influence HS&E incidence. An analysis of reporting behavior provides mixed support for the hypothesis that well- known firms are more likely to report an incident than their more anonymous counterparts. There is weak evidence indicating differential reporting behavior between regulatory districts. Finally, the analysis provides consistent support for the conclusion that a 1996 policy change reduced HS&E incidence and increased HS&E reporting. The results of this research provide guidance to company managers and regulators on the factors driving HS&E incidence and reporting. Results also provide evidence that models of imperfect reporting can alter, in this case reverse, the interpretation of trends in reported incidents.

Extractive waste management is subject to the requirements contained in legal regulations at both EU and national level. In accordance with the provisions of applicable legal acts, it is recommended to prevent the production of extractive waste, to limit its generated amount and the impact on the environment. The next step in the management of extractive waste is its recovery, and the last is disposal in appropriate landfills. This article discusses applicable legal, national and EU regulations regarding the possibilities of waste management arising from the activity of oil and gas mining. The number of applicable legal acts in the area is relatively large, and the most important regulations include the Extractive Waste Act of July 10, 2008 (Ustawa z dnia 10 lipca 2008 r.), Waste Act of December 14, 2012 (Ustawa z dnia 14 grudnia 2012 r.) and the Act of June 9, 2011 - Geological and Mining Law (Ustawa z dnia 9 czerwca 2011 r.). The review has clearly shown that efforts should be made to reduce the amount of the extractive waste generated and to reuse it. In the light of applicable legal regulations, several of the waste disposal methods recommended in the Annex to the Act (Ustawa z dnia 14 grudnia 2012 r.) can be applied to drilling waste, i.e. D1 processes (storage in the ground or on the soil surface), D2 (processing in the soil and on the ground), D3 (deep injection), D5 (storage in landfills in a deliberately designed way), D7 (discharge to seas and oceans) and D9 (physico-chemical treatment). Storage of such waste in landfills is the last resort. Extractive waste, including drilling waste, may be stored in an underground waste disposal facility or in an extractive waste disposal facility in accordance with applicable legal regulations. However, despite the relatively large number of legal acts regarding the possible management of extractive waste at the national level, there are still no regulations exhausting the entire subject of managing this type of waste. In addition, Polish law is often inconsistent in this respect.YY",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0867-8871,,,,,,,,,,,"Panstwowy Inst Badawczy, Inst Nafty & Gazu, Warsaw, Poland",,,,2021-02-19,WOS:000610406200009,,

Model inputs include external, corporate and direct factors, and the approach includes methods often favoured by professionals from the safety, engineering, and psychology disciplines.As a precursor to model development, a comprehensive literature review was conducted. One objective of the review was to understand the previous approaches taken by other researchers and thereby identify any gaps in the knowledge. The lack of a holistic, quantitative model addressing occupational accidents in the oil and gas industry was established. A second objective was to select and categorise the factors most influential in the accident process and thereby provide a foundation for the present model. Optimal choices required a systematic study of the factors proposed by other researchers.The literature studied has been summarised in this paper, subdivided into two primary groups: (i) descriptions of existing accident models, and (ii) analyses of existing data. In addition, descriptions of literature specifically concerned with two key elements in the occupational accident process, human factors and safety culture, have been included. Based on the literature reviewed, the novelty of the present model has been discussed. The systematic approach taken to choose the factors thought most influential in the occupational accident process, and which were therefore included in the model, has been described.

Movement of terrestrial carbon from land to water represents a loss of carbon from the former and a gain for the latter, and these changes must be taken into account when determining the net carbon balance of either system. In most terrestrial carbon cycle studies, the magnitude of this loss has not been determined, possibly resulting in an over-estimation of carbon storage in the terrestrial system. If the carbon that enters the aquatic system is eventually respired, or lost to the atmosphere, then this is a potentially serious error in calculations of regional and global carbon cycling. The specific goal of this project is to determine the age of terrestrially-derived carbon from forests in Massachusetts and the subsequent metabolic fate of this carbon in adjacent aquatic systems over seasonal and annual cycles. A multi-disciplinary approach will employ a variety of biochemical and analytical techniques to determine the age and fate of soil carbon. The research will have important implications for decision makes and managers who are interested in maximizing net carbon storage within particular regions. Outreach efforts will focus on the concept of connectivity between inland ecosystems and downstream estuaries and the coastal zone. The focus will be on improving the coverage of concepts and topics in aquatic ecology in curricula for K-12 education.

For this, a Central Composite Design (CCD) was used, considering three independent variables at three levels: initial olefin content (7.5, 10, and 12.5% w/w), power (250, 500, and 750 W), and time (5, 10, and 15 min); the residual olefin content being the response analyzed in the conducted tests without monitoring or control of the cutting's temperature. All three variables studied were statistically significant, presenting a positive or negative effect on residual olefin content. As expected, the initial olefin content had a negative effect on the response. On the other hand, when considering the applied power and the drying time, the effect on decontamination yield was positive. The results showed that cuttings can be decontaminated at lower levels than those required by environmental legislation (offshore drilling), reaching residual olefin mass contents of less than 1%. Finally, the organic phase of recovered liquids, after the condensation of vapors produced during drying, was analyzed by gas chromatography technique. It was observed greater olefin degradation in the longer and higher power tests, especially in samples of condensed liquid collected inside the microwave oven.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1294-4475,1953-8189,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Uberlandia, Fac Chem Engn, Av Joao Naves de Avila 2121,1K, BR-38408100 Uberlandia, MG, BrazilUniv Fed Sao Joao del Rei, Dept Chem Engn, Campus Alto Paraopeba, Ouro Branco, MG, Brazil",,,,2020-01-24,WOS:000507313700001,,

The amount of biomass consumed is of interest to fire managers as reduction of fuel loads is imperative to reducing the risk and extent of a wildfire event. Biomass regeneration is also of importance for ecosystem recovery and resilience. Pyrogenic carbon (PyC), a product of combustion during both planned and unplanned fires, plays a key role in global carbon stores and balances. A three-year study of planned burning practices examined fires in Lowland temperate Eucalypt forest of south eastern Australia. We collected data on overstorey, understorey, coarse woody debris, fine litter, PyC and soil across nine sites to determine biomass consumption, PyC production and changes in ecosystem carbon during planned burning. Lowland forest showed significant recovery of combustible biomass (fine litter and understorey) one year after planned fire. Across our sites, PyC was produced at a rate of approximately 5% of the biomass consumed. The PyC produced is destined to become part of soil and litter carbon and contributes to long-term carbon storage. Planned burning had a short-term (<1 year) impact on forest carbon balance, and on reduction risk of wildfire and associated losses of biomass carbon, but no long-term impact, through deposition of PyC and recovery of biomass.

Subsurface imaging for oil and gas exploration is traditionally dominated by seismic reflection as it offers a resolution unparalleled by other methods in layered sedimentary environments, the classic areas for hydrocarbon reservoirs. As exploration is moving into more complex environments-for example, sub-basalt and sub-salt sediments-seismic methods reach their limits and alternative approaches are needed. This has driven the industry to investigate joint inversion and joint interpretation approaches.In the first part of this chapter we review the current literature and introduce interesting approaches that have been developed in the context of hydrocarbon exploration and could potentially be used in other application areas as well. Commercial providers of joint inversion in particular try to maximise the level of detail in the joint inversion models by combining full-waveform inversion with controlled source electromagnetics in order to meet the expectations of exploration managers used to modern three-dimensional reflection surveys. Joint inversion methods incorporating petrophysical models of the reservoir can directly yield quantities of interest such as porosity and permeability, but have to be carefully tuned to the area under investigation. Probabilistic inversion approaches that permit detailed quantitative specification of prior assumptions and yield uncertainty information on the inversion results are gaining popularity in hydrocarbon exploration even though they are still at a largely conceptual stage. Emulators provide a way to approximate lengthy forward calculations for such statistical inversion approaches and have mathematically well defined properties. They can therefore open the door for full stochastic inversions with high computing requirements that are currently still out of reach.In the second part we present two detailed joint inversion case studies, one for sub-salt imaging and one for subbasalt imaging. We investigate the different coupling methods that are required for successful joint inversion and the impact on different parameters on the final results. Although some of the specifics might be related to our particular implementations, they hopefully provide practitioners in any application area with useful recipes and experiences.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,0,17,,,0065-8448,,978-1-118-92908-7; 978-1-118-92905-6,,,,,,,,,"Univ Leicester, Dept Geol, Leicester, Leics, EnglandHelmholtz Ctr Ocean Sci, Geomar, Kiel, GermanyGeol Survey Denmark & Greenland, Copenhagen, DenmarkUniv Durham, Sci Labs, Dept Earth Sci, Durham, EnglandGeospatial Res Ltd, Durham, England",Geospatial Res Ltd,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000447139700011,,

Thousands of oil spill workers participated in the spill response and clean-up efforts. The GuLF STUDY being conducted by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is an epidemiological study to investigate potential adverse health effects among these oil spill clean-up workers. Many volatile chemicals were released from the oil into the air, including total hydrocarbons (THC), which is a composite of the volatile components of oil including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and hexane (BTEXH). Our goal is to estimate exposure levels to these toxic chemicals for groups of oil spill workers in the study (hereafter called exposure groups, EGs) with likely comparable exposure distributions. A large number of air measurements were collected, but many EGs are characterized by datasets with a large percentage of censored measurements (below the analytic methods' limits of detection) and/or a limited number of measurements. We use THC for which there was less censoring to develop predictive linear models for specific BTEXH air exposures with higher degrees of censoring. We present a novel Bayesian hierarchical linear model that allows us to predict, for different EGs simultaneously, exposure levels of a second chemical while accounting for censoring in both THC and the chemical of interest. We illustrate the methodology by estimating exposure levels for several EGs on the Development Driller III, a rig vessel charged with drilling one of the relief wells. The model provided credible estimates in this example for geometric means, arithmetic means, variances, correlations, and regression coefficients for each group. This approach should be considered when estimating exposures in situations when multiple chemicals are correlated and have varying degrees of censoring.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,18,0,23,,,2398-7308,2398-7316,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USAUniv Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biostat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USAJohns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USAExposure Assessments Applicat LLC, Arlington, VA 22207 USANIEHS, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USANCI, Bethesda, MD 20892 USAUniv North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Epidemiol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USAStewart Exposure Assessments LLC, Arlington, VA 22207 USA",Exposure Assessments Applicat LLCStewart Exposure Assessments LLC,,,2017-08-14,WOS:000405564900009,28395309,

Chemical contaminants were measured in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in Sydney Harbour, which were used as monitoring tools to assess the spatio-temporal distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); metals (As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, Zn) and lipid content during baseline and 3 years of remediation. The overall spatio-temporal distribution of chemicals in mussels was also compared to contaminants in other marine indicators (e.g., sediment, water and crab tissue). Measured metal concentrations in mussels showed some minor temporal variability (4 years), but these did not appear to be directly related to remediation activities, with the highest concentrations of As, Hg and Zn measured at reference stations. Most measured contaminants showed stable or potentially decreasing concentrations during the study, except Pb and Zn. Individual PAH compounds were mostly undetected during baseline and remediation, except for fluoranthene and pyrene. Concentrations of fluoranthene in mussels and deep water samples were moderately related. Generally, PCBs were undetected (< 0.05 mu g g(-1)), except during year 2 remediation at some near-field stations. Contaminants measured during this study were at much lower concentrations than previously reported in other studies of mussels in Sydney Harbour and eastern Canada. This is likely due to the ongoing natural recovery of Sydney Harbour and to a lesser extent because of the environmental mitigation protection measures implemented during remediation activities at the STPs. The lack of detection of most individual PAHs and PCBs, plus relatively low bio-accumulation of metals observed during baseline and remediation attest to the effectiveness of using mussels as monitoring tools for environmental quality.",,,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,26,0,30,,,0167-6369,1573-2959,,,,,,,,,,"Dillon Consulting Ltd, Halifax, NS B3S 1B3, CanadaDillon Consulting Ltd, Sydney, NS B1P 1C6, Canada",Dillon Consulting LtdDillon Consulting Ltd,,,2014-03-15,WOS:000330715300024,24105125,

Similar evaluations for chemicals used in other routine oil and gas development activities, such as maintenance acidizing, gravel packing, and well drilling, have not been previously conducted, in part due to a lack of reliable information concerning on-field chemical-use. In this study, we compare chemical-use between routine activities and the more closely regulated well-stimulation activities using data collected by the South Coast Air Quality Monitoring District (SCAQMD), which mandates the reporting of both unconventional and routine on-field chemical-use for parts of Southern California. Analysis of this data shows that there is significant overlap in chemical-use between so-called unconventional activities and routine activities conducted for well maintenance, well-completion, or rework. A comparison within the SCAQMD shows a significant overlap between both types and amounts of chemicals used for well-stimulation treatments included under State mandatory-disclosure regulations and routine treatments that are not included under State regulations. A comparison between SCAQMD chemical-use for routine treatments and state-wide chemical-use for hydraulic fracturing also showed close similarity in chemical-use between activities covered under chemical disclosure requirements (e.g. hydraulic fracturing) and many other oil and gas field activities. The results of this study indicate regulations and risk assessments focused exclusively on chemicals used in well-stimulation activities may underestimate potential hazard or risk from overall oil field chemical-use.

Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are a major source of marine organic carbon for MOS and microgel formation. EPS initial aggregation plays key roles in the oil degrading process and various biogeochemical reactions. Here we used four types of EPS with water accommodated fraction (WAF), chemically-enhanced WAF (CEWAF) and Corexit, to represent potential situations during oil spills and post-application of Corexit. We found that Corexit alone can inhibit EPS aggregation and disperse pre-existing microgels. CEWAF can enhance EPS aggregation with efficiency by up to 80%-100% and more aggregates accumulated within the air-water interface. Additionally, more hydrophobic EPS aggregates showed high resistance to Corexit dispersion while hydrophilic EPS were more sensitive. Effects of oil spills on marine gel particle formation are primarily determined by chemical characteristics (hydrophobicity and protein content) of the constituent EPS. This study offers unique insights for organic particle dynamics and identifies controlling factors for MOS or gel particles associated with oil spills and Corexit dispersant used.

The use of very large topside modules is one of the effective ways to reduce the integration time and decrease the possibility of fabrication defects.The Ichthys Project's CPF(Central Process Facility) is currently being constructed at Samsung Heavy Industries(SHI). The CPF will be the world's largest production semi submersible platform. The hull is constructed on the Offshore Floating Dock and most of the topside modules are prepared at workshops and integrated by floating cranes on the hull.To maximize production efficiency in terms of reduced integration time and reworks, several topside modules are assembled into a larger module weighing up to 7,400 tonne spanning 150m long. Such large module cannot be handled by a single 8,000 tonne F/C, the largest crane that SHI owns. This fact initiated the idea of dual-lifting with a combination of the two F/Cs (8,000 tonne and 3,600 tonne) which enables lifting, transportation and integration of the mega-modules properly and safely without building a larger capacity F/C. Using different sized F/Cs increases the flexibility of the operation of the F/Cs.To ensure safety during the dual-lifting, the two F/Cs are synchronized to be controlled as a single crane unit. During hoisting, all the measured data such as loads and positions of the hooks, and rotation of the module, are monitored in real time basis and used to hoist the module automatically. All the systems are designed to be redundant. Additional engineering works are performed to check the safety such as 1) structural analysis to investigate the structural safety with out-of-phased motions at boom-tip 2) time-domain analysis and 3) model test in ocean basin with the operation scenarios in real environments to obtain the dynamic load factors and the guidance on the operation limits in terms of wave heights. The two crane barges are moored side-by-side using fenders and mooring lines, and tug operation conditions are planned not only to move but also to push the two barges from sideways to be moored tightly, which minimizes the possibility of relative motions between the two barges.The developed system had been applied to the integration of all the modules successfully weighing from 4600 to 7400 tonne. It is expected to be applied to many other offshore projects to keep the construction schedule on time. This paper will address and share the technical experiences obtained during the dual lifting of the mega-modules for the Ichthys Project's CPF.",,,,,"35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2016JUN 19-24, 2016","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4992-7,,,,,,,,,"Samsung Heavy Ind Co Ltd, Cent Res Inst, 217 Munji Ro, Daejeon, South Korea",,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000393090000046,,

Here, we critically review state-of-the-art techniques and promising new approaches for identifying oil and gas production from unconventional reservoirs to resolve whether they are the source of fugitive methane and associated contaminants into shallow aquifers. We highlight future research needs and propose a phased program, from generic baseline to highly specific analyses, to inform HVHF and unconventional oil and gas production and impact assessment studies. These approaches may also be applied to broader subsurface exploration and development issues (e.g., groundwater resources), or new frontiers of low-carbon energy alternatives (e.g., subsurface H-2 storage, nuclear waste isolation, geologic CO2 sequestration).",,,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,16,1,50,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Atmospher Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USAUniv Saskatchewan, Dept Geol Sci, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, CanadaUniv Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3AN, EnglandUniv Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh EH9 3FE, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Calgary, Dept Geosci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, CanadaIst Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Sez Roma 2, Rome, ItalyBabes Bolyai Univ, Fac Environm Sci & Engn, Cluj Napoca, RomaniaTech Univ Munich, Chair Analyt Chem & Water Chem, Munich, GermanyOhio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Div Solid Earth Dynam & Water, Columbus, OH 43210 USAOhio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Div Climate & Environm, Columbus, OH 43210 USAGEO4U, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilCalif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Dept Geol Sci, Pomona, CA 91768 USACSIRO Energy, Kensington, NSW 6151, AustraliaUniv Sci & Technol China, CAS Ctr Excellence Quantum Informat & Quantum Phy, Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R ChinaAmherst Coll, Dept Geol, Amherst, MA 01002 USAUniv Toronto, Dept Earth Sci, Toronto, ON MSS 3B1, Canada",GEO4U,,,2019-02-05,WOS:000458220600003,30585065,

Prior work by Reference [1] using blade element methods (BEM) and free vortex methods (FVM) [2] has produced reasonable models that predict the hydrodynamic performance of the Darrieus turbine. The validated models reasonably estimate the performance at low solidities (Nc/R<<1), but lose accuracy at higher solidity ratios. Dynamic stall and flow curvature has been recognized by [2] [3] and [4] to be significant modeling parameters which have limited the accuracy of prior models. The current numerical model extends the predictions of the FVM model to a higher solidity ratio range. An improved model is presented for the condition of high angles of attack and for dynamic stall,. Experimental data on a series of two (Nc/R approximate to.9) and four (Nc/ R approximate to 1.8) blade configurations are presented as validation of the modified analytical vortex model.Tidal Energy has the potential to be an important source to diversify and provide affordable renewable power to people near coastal areas. However, some of the best tidal currents available are near sensitive areas for fish spawning and feeding. For this reason, any device that is to be designed for installation in this environment has to minimize impact on these fragile ecosystems. The Darrieus turbine offers an attractive alternative design because of these environmental considerations. High solidity turbines are of interest since they operate at lower tip speed ratios and allow for lower pressure gradients along the blade. These characteristics have the potential to reduce environmental impact on marine fauna, as the conditions of excessive mechanical strike, cavitations, shear and large pressure gradients are minimized while maintaining reasonable power coefficient values.In order to analyze the performance of the high solidity Darrieus turbine, the FVM model was chosen to model the turbine and wake with discrete vortex segments, which were then used to determine the induced velocities at the blade. Although the computational expense is greater than with other methods, like BEM models, FVM models can better predict the turbine performance at higher tip to flow speed ratios and higher rotor solidities. These methods also have the advantage of providing information of the wake profile and can be extended to provide information on the interaction of different devices.The lifting line FVM model requires the lift and drag curves to be prescribed for a given hydrofoil profile. Experimental data have shown that the dynamic stall contribution is higher than expected at low tip speed ratios for high solidity Darrieus turbines. Because of the complex nature of the problem, an empirical lift model based on theoretical foundation is used. An approximation of the known asymptotic limit values was used to account for the dynamic stall behavior.In order to validate the empirical lift model for the FVM, a set of experiments was conducted using NACA 63018 blades at different toe angles, tip speed ratios, and free stream velocities. Results will be shown for a numerical model of high solidity Darrieus type cross flow turbines which have been experimentally validated. High solidity rotors (1 < Nc/R < 2) were tested and modeled for conditions of blade dynamic stall and other effects.",,,,,Washington State Conference and Trade Center (WSCTC)Washington State Conference and Trade Center (WSCTC),"SEP 20-23, 2010SEP 20-23, 2010",IEEE; Marine Technol; OESIEEE; Marine Technol; OES,"Seattle, WASeattle, WA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4244-4333-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maine, Dept Mech Engn, Orono, ME 04469 USAMaine Maritime Acad, Dept Engn, Castine, ME 04420 USA",Maine Maritime Acad,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000287539100193,,

They are frequently used as the basis for generic criteria for monitoring programs designed to test whether a sample is outside of normal, as in reference-condition approach studies. Normal ranges are also the basis for criteria for more classic environmental effects monitoring programs designed to detect differences in mean responses between reference and exposure areas. Limits on normal ranges are estimated with error that varies depending largely on sample size. Direct comparison of a sample or a mean to estimated limits of a normal range will, with some frequency, lead to incorrect conclusions about whether a sample or a mean is inside or outside the normal range when the sample or the mean is near the limit. Those errors can have significant costs and risk implications. This article describes tests based on noncentral distributions that are appropriate for quantifying the likelihood that samples or means are outside a normal range. These noncentral tests reverse the burden of evidence (assuming that the sample or mean is at or outside normal), and thereby encourage proponents to collect more robust sample sizes that will demonstrate that the sample or mean is not at the limits or beyond the normal range. These noncentral equivalence and interval tests can be applied to uni- and multivariate responses, and to simple (e. g., upstream vs downstream) or more complex (e. g., before vs after, or upstream vs downstream) study designs.

In this contribution we present a whole-systems analysis of the BECCS value chain associated with cultivation, harvesting, transport and conversion in dedicated biomass power stations in conjunction with CCS, of a range of biomass resources - both dedicated energy crops (miscanthus, switchgrass, short rotation coppice willow), and agricultural residues (wheat straw). We explicitly consider the implications of sourcing the biomass from different regions, climates and land types. The water, carbon and energy footprints of each value chain were calculated, and their impact on the overall system water, carbon and power efficiencies was evaluated. An extensive literature review was performed and a statistical analysis of the available data is presented. In order to describe the dynamic greenhouse gas balance of such a system, a yearly accounting of the emissions was performed over the lifetime of a BECCS facility, and the carbon breakeven time'' and lifetime net CO2 removal from the atmosphere were determined. The effects of direct and indirect land use change were included, and were found to be a key determinant of the viability of a BECCS project. Overall we conclude that, depending on the conditions of its deployment, BECCS could lead to both carbon positive and negative results. The total quantity of CO2 removed from the atmosphere over the project lifetime and the carbon breakeven time were observed to be highly case specific. This has profound implications for the policy frameworks required to incentivise and regulate the widespread deployment of BECCS technology. The results of a sensitivity analysis on the model combined with the investigation of alternate supply chain scenarios elucidated key levers to improve the sustainability of BECCS: (1) measuring and limiting the impacts of direct and indirect land use change, (2) using carbon neutral power and organic fertilizer, (3) minimising biomass transport, and prioritising sea over road transport, (4) maximising the use of carbon negative fuels, and (5) exploiting alternative biomass processing options, e.g., natural drying or torrefaction.

This scenario has not been given the same level of scientific attention in the literature compared to surface releases and assessment of consequences therefrom. This paper addresses questions like, (1) does an LNG spill underwater form a pool on the water surface and subsequently evaporate like an LNG spill on the surface producing cold, heavier than air vapors?, and (2) what is the range of expected temperatures of the vapor, generated by LNG release due to heat transfer within the water column, when it emanates from the water surface?Very limited data from two field tests of LNG underwater release are reviewed. Also presented are the results from tests conducted in other related industries (metal casting, nuclear fission and fusion, chemical processing, and alternative fuel vehicles) where a hot (or cold) liquid is injected into a bulk cold (or hot) liquid at different depths.A mathematical model is described which calculates the temperature of vapor emanating at the water surface, and the liquid fraction of released LNG that surfaces, if any, to form a pool on the water surface. The model includes such variables as the LNG release rate, diameter of the jet at release, depth of release and water body temperature.

For technical feasibility studies, it is presupposed that once the currents at a site have been well characterized it is possible to make accurate predictions of the electricity that would be generated by an array of turbines. These data are generally collected by Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP), which use active acoustics to measure currents throughout the water column. Stationary ADCP deployments in Admiralty Inlet, WA, indicate operationally important variability over length scales less than 100 m and use of shipboard ADCP surveys aims to identify regions of peak currents without deploying a high resolution grid of stationary ADCPs. Shipboard surveys involve multiple laps during a tidal cycle around a short racetrack. Data are aggregated within bins such that multiple laps produce time series at 100 m spatial resolution along the track. The time series is then fitted with a half sine wave assuming that each tidal cycle can be represented as such due to the periodic nature of tidal currents. The amplitude and timing of the peak currents along the survey track are estimated from the fit. Multiple ebb current surveys indicate that relative amplitude trends are consistent between cycles of differing strength and time of the year. Therefore, by overlapping surveys, greater spatial coverage can be achieved from multiple cycles without changing the survey characteristics. Results obtained to date suggest a noise floor of approximately +/-15 minutes for phase.

Following the recognition of cocoa agroforests as being useful for biodiversity conservation and farmers' livelihoods, there is a growing discourse on the fact that they may also be useful in climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. Several companies have expressed their willingness to be deforestation certified within the next two decades. In West and Central Africa, cocoa is part of the endeavour to contribute to the REDD+ mechanism. Besides producing cocoa beans, the additional expectations from cocoa agroforests (timber, NWFP, biodiversity conservation, carbon storage, etc horizontal ellipsis ) depend on the trees associated with the cocoa plants. The manner in which associated trees are mixed in the system impacts on the cocoa plants and plants associated with cocoa trees within the agroforestry system thus impact on the products and services produced by these farming systems. Studies are being undertaken to identify the exact composition of these associated trees but very few deal with the manner in which these trees are structurally distributed-vertically and horizontally-within the cocoa agroforest. Understanding the way in which cocoa and non-cocoa trees are distributed within the system would be useful with a view to improving the farm system, thus meeting the needs of several stakeholders. The present study reviews the structure of cocoa orchards and agroforests in West and Central Africa (Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire) with a view to improving the products and services of cocoa landscapes. This review is centred around: (i) density of cocoa, (ii) density of associated plants, (iii) basal area or associated plants, (iv) stratification and space between components, and (v) the life cycle of cocoa plantation components. Densities of cocoa and associated plants in the field are not always those advised by extension services. The cocoa varieties play an important role in type and intensity of shade of the cocoa farms. In the context of multiple expectations placed on cocoa plantations, the unproductive cocoa trees in the farmer fields can be substituted by more vigorous ones or replaced by useful associated plants (Timber and NWFP). With the growing desire to reproduce some key attributes of local forests while responding to other economic and social needs associated with cocoa farms, the neighbouring/previous forest climax and its related basal area can be considered as a reasonable aim, when managing the cocoa agroforest. The life cycle of each of the plant components needs to be optimized in these spatial-temporal intensification considerations. In the prospect of vertical intensification, there is a need to give more attention to understorey management and the number of strata of the agroforest. In the context of sustainable management, a well-structured cocoa agroforest system needs to take landscape, local, national and global socio-economic and political issues into consideration.",,,,,15th North American Agroforestry Conference15th North American Agroforestry Conference,"JUN 27-29, 2017JUN 27-29, 2017",,"Virginia Tech Univ, Blacksburg, VAVirginia Tech Univ, Blacksburg, VA",14,1,0,0,6,0,16,,,0167-4366,1572-9680,,,,,,,,,,"Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, POB 2008, Yaounde, CameroonIITA, STCP, Yaounde, CameroonBiovers Int, Rome, ItalyUniv Bonn, Unit Trop Crops, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat, INRES Inst Nutzpflanzenwissensch & Ressourcenschu, Auf Dem Huegel 6, D-53121 Bonn, GermanyMars Inc, 6885 Elm St, Mclean, VA 22101 USAUniv Calif Davis, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USAWorld Agroforestry Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya",IITA,,,2019-09-09,WOS:000482399600031,,

Unfortunately, though there are potentially significant issues with the installation torque and force requirements of these geometries, which mean accurate torque and force prediction models are required to feed into design decisions such as at what water depth group deployment is preferable to individual piles (group efficiency, coupled with more smaller piles resulting in lower installation requirements). There is ongoing work looking at some of these question in sands but little attention has been given to how these problems can be overcome in clay. This project will expand existing work undertaken in sand and investigate if this can be applied in clay soils. Aims and objectives:1, Development of reliable screw pile torque/force installation requirement prediction tools for different pile geometries.2, Understanding the effect of group screw pile installation on both torque/force requirements and pile interaction efficiency.3, Investigate novel solutions to installation torque/force reduction (e.g. torque plus vibration installation) and how these can be incorporated in pile geometry optimisation and installation plant development.4, Develop tools to predict installation requirements and in-service screw pile performance in clay based upon standard field insitu investigation techniques.Research methodology:1, Specialist physical modelling facilities will be used to investigate the effect of individual and group installation effects on torque/force requirements, in-service pile performance and to develop insitu test based design techniques. These systems will allow realistic simulation of the installation process and will be developed in this project to allow the piles to be subject to cyclic loading.2, Investigation of group effects using numerical (finite element, FE) simulation will be developed to allow a wide range of situations to be modelled in an efficient manner with validation against scale model testing.3, Computational Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) coupled with Finite Element Analysis will also be developed in a novel application of these computational techniques to the difficult problem of rotating and pushing an object. This process will be validated against the physical modelling and in-service pile performance compared to FE techniques that cannot easily model installation.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1950239,,,,,,,,University of Dundee,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15347459,,

S. Pacific Northwest involve a perceived trade-off between. re restoration and carbon sequestration. The former strategy would reduce fuel ( and therefore C) that has accumulated through a century of. re suppression and exclusion which has led to extreme. re risk in some areas. The latter strategy would manage forests for enhanced C sequestration as a method of reducing atmospheric CO(2) and associated threats from global climate change. We explored the trade-off between these two strategies by employing a forest ecosystem simulation model, STANDCARB, to examine the effects of fuel reduction on. re severity and the resulting long-term C dynamics among three Pacific Northwest ecosystems: the east Cascades ponderosa pine forests, the west Cascades western hemlock-Douglas-fir forests, and the Coast Range western hemlock-Sitka spruce forests. Our simulations indicate that fuel reduction treatments in these ecosystems consistently reduced. re severity. However, reducing the fraction by which C is lost in a wild. re requires the removal of a much greater amount of C, since most of the C stored in forest biomass ( stem wood, branches, coarse woody debris) remains unconsumed even by high-severity wild. res. For this reason, all of the fuel reduction treatments simulated for the west Cascades and Coast Range ecosystems as well as most of the treatments simulated for the east Cascades resulted in a reduced mean stand C storage. One suggested method of compensating for such losses in C storage is to utilize C harvested in fuel reduction treatments as biofuels. Our analysis indicates that this will not be an effective strategy in the west Cascades and Coast Range over the next 100 years. We suggest that forest management plans aimed solely at ameliorating increases in atmospheric CO2 should forgo fuel reduction treatments in these ecosystems, with the possible exception of some east Cascades ponderosa pine stands with uncharacteristic levels of understory fuel accumulation. Balancing a demand for maximal landscape C storage with the demand for reduced wild. re severity will likely require treatments to be applied strategically throughout the landscape rather than indiscriminately treating all stands.",,,,,,,,,118,1,0,0,98,0,139,,,1051-0761,,,,,,,,,,,"Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,,,2009-04-01,WOS:000264309500014,19425428,

A series of ceramic test-pieces (briquettes and cylinders) were purposely manufactured by mixing selected calcareous or non-calcareous clays with different varieties of sieved sand temper. The aim was to reasonably simulate the ceramic pastes most frequently found in the shipwrecks recovered in the coastal areas of western Mediterranean. The used raw materials were previously characterized in terms of mineralogical and chemical composition (XRPD, XRF). The obtained test-pieces were fired under oxidizing conditions at predetermined temperatures (800 and 950 degrees C) in a traditional ceramic kiln and their chemical composition was analyzed by XRF spectrometry. Briquettes were firstly fixed into customized Ertacetal (R) holders and then placed in open sea-bed environment under monitored oxidizing or reducing conditions by the Italian CNR-IAMC dockside at Granitola, north-western Sicily. At the same time, two customized glass containers for working in a confined system under continuous seawater flow were designed and realized. They were filled with bottom sediments rather different in size in order to produce either reducing or oxidizing microenvironments below the water-sediment interface. Cylinder shaped test-pieces were placed in the sediment of both the glass containers. Weekly monitoring of temperature, salinity, conductivity, pH, Eh, dissolved oxygen was carried out in both the above-described experimental settings. Comparative (before/after) XRF analyses, after 3 months of exposure to seawater, were performed on the experimental ceramic briquettes and cylinders. The obtained results provided preliminary evidences that the proposed experimental strategy is efficiently working and a number of not negligible changes concerning major and trace elements were pointed out just after such a restricted time of exposure to seawater.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,0,8,,,0369-8963,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Terra & Mare DiSTeM, I-90123 Palermo, ItalyUniv Catania, Dipartimento Sci Biol Geol & Ambientali, Sez Sci Terra, I-95129 Catania, ItalyUniv Calabria, Dipartimento Biol Ecol & Sci Terra DiBEST, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, ItalyIst Ambiente Marino Costiero UO Capo Granitola, Consiglio Nazl Ric, Campobello Di Mazara, Trapani, Italy",,,,2014-05-28,WOS:000335284700006,,

It is located near shipping lanes, is a highly variable acoustic environment, and is frequented by the endangered southern resident killer whale (SRKW). Resolving environmental impacts is the first step to receiving approval to deploy tidal turbines at Admiralty Inlet. Of particular concern is the potential for blade strike or other negative interactions between the SRKW and the tidal turbine. A variety of technologies including passive and active monitoring systems are being considered as potential tools to determine the presence of SRKW in the vicinity of the turbines. Broadband noise level measurements are critical for determining design and operational specifications of ocean energy capture technologies. Acoustic environment data at the proposed site was acquired at different depths using a cabled vertical line array (VLA) with four calibrated hydrophones. The power spectrum density of the sound pressure level (SPL) was estimated using the fast Fourier transform. This study describes the first broadband SPL measurements for this site at different depths with frequencies ranging from 10 kHz to 480 kHz in combination with other information. To understand the SPL caused by bedload transport, three different pressure sensors with temperature and conductivity were also assembled on the VLA to measure the conditions at the hydrophone deployment depth. The broadband SPL levels at frequency ranges of 3 kHz to 7 kHz as a function of depth were estimated. Only the hydrophone at an average depth of 40 m showed the strong dependence of SPL with distance from the bottom, which was possibly caused by the cobbles shifting on the seabed.

Since then, ship modernizations have decreased occupational exposure to gases, including the carcinogen benzene. We explored the risk of HMs in Swedish seafarers who had worked on newer types of tankers.Methods A case-referent study in male seafarers from a cohort of all Swedish seafarers was set up by record linkage with the Swedish Cancer Registry using the subjects' personal identification number. For each case (N = 315), five referents were randomly chosen from within the cohort, matched by birth year and three different periods of first sea service (<1985, 1985-1991, and >= 1992). Information on the type of ship and dates of service was retrieved from the Swedish Seafarers' Registry. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by conditional logistic regression together with 95% confidence intervals (CI).Results The OR of HM was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.80-1.42) for work on tankers. In seafarers that had started to work on tankers >= 1985, the OR was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.50-1.43). For those who started to work on tankers before 1985, the OR was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.84-1.21) and 1.32 (95% CI, 0.86-2.03) if the cumulative time on tankers exceeded 5 years of service. In this last group, the OR of multiple myeloma was 5.39 (95% CI, 1.11-26.1).Conclusion Although limited by crude exposure contrast and a short follow-up, work on tankers after 1985 was not associated with an increased risk of HM among Swedish seafarers.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0271-3586,1097-0274,,,,,,,,,,"Gothenburg Univ, Sahlgrenska Acad, Dept Occupat & Environm Med, Gothenburg, SwedenUmea Univ, Dept Radiat Sci, Oncol, Umea, SwedenUmea Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Clin Med, Umea, Sweden",,,,2020-05-23,WOS:000534816400001,32445513,

TPH analysis after 30 d showed that mussel shells exhibited the greatest capacity to degrade oil with a 55% reduction (123.3 mg l(-1) from 276 mg l(-1)) followed by mussel shell/agar complex (49%) and coir peat (36%). Both the mussel shells and mussel shell/agar complex carriers were significantly different to the control (P = 0.008 and P = 0.002, respectively). DGGE based cluster analysis of the seawater microbial community showed groupings based on time rather than carriers.

This new approach appeared more advantageous in avoiding the inconsistency in interfacial tension measurements, and consequently delivered concise droplet size prediction. Calculated and observed data correlated well based on Reynolds number scaling. The relation indicated that chemical dispersant played an important role in reducing the droplet size of ANS under different seasonal conditions.

Experiments conducted on Australia's tropical northeast coast, established the economic importance of flowering and lodging and provided insights into their control mechanisms. The effect of flowering on yield was determined using lit and unlit night regimes. Photoperiods at low and intermediate tropical latitudes (2 degrees versus 17 degrees) were contrasted for their effect on flowering. Losses for cane yield, sugar content, and sugar yield from flowering were 6.8, 3.0, and 9.4%, respectively. The latter equated to the penalty used in BSES Limited's tropical program for free, early season flowering. Sub-optimal photoperiod is largely responsible for poor and variable flowering in programs located close to the equator, and this may be confounded with high day temperature. The effect of six moisture regimes on particle initiation and development was studied. Moisture regimes did not differ for flowering within crops, but differences between crops (29.4% versus 0.8% flowered stalks) coincided with an El Nino event and high temperatures in the ratoon crop, proving adequate soil moisture is not a sufficient condition for flowering. Seven early season phenotypic plant descriptors and two structural stalk traits were assessed as predictors of harvest erectness. Brix, commercial cane sugar (CCS), and fibre of erect and lodged stalks were determined to assess the impact of lodging prior to and within the harvest season. The interactions of the effects of cultivars with planting depth and mounding on erectness were examined. All phenotypic traits, except stalk height, and two structural stalk traits correlated poorly with plant erectness at harvest. Regression analyses revealed leaf width, plant top length, and stalk number were significant predictors of crop erectness at harvest, but their practical relevance is unclear. Pre-season loss of erectness and stalk condition (sound or unsound), resulted in a 12 and 8% loss of CCS, respectively, and a 24% loss combined. Erect- and lodged-stalk CCS increased during the season. The marked differential between classes in July (18 and 23% of erect stalks, in two crops) decreased by September (10 and 11%). The effect of increasing depth of anchorage approached significance suggesting crop erectness can be enhanced using appropriate cultural practices. Selection against flowering has been very successful and is justifiable economically. Poor flowering constrains achievable genetic recombination, but managed photoperiod regimes, combined with management of key environmental variables, alleviates this. Loss of CCS due to lodging is economically critical. Crop erectness via ideotype selection is achievable, but development of early season, aboveground traits as predictive variables has proven elusive. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A recovery to baseline conditions suggests that the concentration of alkanes may be near baseline values by the end of 2015, but that it may take decades for the PAH concentrations to be that low.

Experiments were conducted with natural materials which were contaminated by direct application of fresh Louisiana crude oil. The natural materials evaluated included sea sand (South Beach in Miami, Florida), red mangrove leaves (Rhizophora mangle), and sea shells (Donax variabili). Salt water at two different salinities (17 and 34 ppt) was used with two types of Corexit dispersant solutions (9500A and 9527A) in concentrations ranging from 100 to 3500 mg/L. Washing of the contaminated samples was conducted by a three-step mixing procedure (salt water only, then with the addition of the dispersant solution to the salt water, and salt water) to simulate oil-saltwater-dispersant interactions. In general, increasing dispersant concentration increased the percentage of oil dispersed into the aqueous phase up to dispersant solutions containing 400 mg/L for Corexit 9500A and 300 mg/L Corexit 9527A. Increasing the dispersant concentration above these levels also decreased the dispersion of oil from the surfaces. At very high concentrations of dispersant solutions (above 1500 mg/L), the percentage of oil dispersed into the solution from the contaminated surfaces was about one half what was observed at 400 mg/L with Corexit 9500A and 300 mg/L Corexit 9527A. Although dispersants were most effective for removing the fresh Louisiana crude oil from sand particles and dispersing into the solution due to large surface area of the particles per unit weight; the residual oil remaining on the sand particles was relatively high in comparison to mangrove leaves and sea shells due to clustering of sand particle with oil. There was some oil penetration into the porous structure of the sea shells (at the microscopic level) which could not be removed.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,0,8,,,0301-4797,1095-8630,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Int Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Miami, FL 33199 USATunghai Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Taichung, Taiwan",,,,2019-09-17,WOS:000483635000038,31252235,

We selected the Chinese Bohai Sea, especially the Bohai Strait, as our investigation region to provide an assessment of the effects of pollution from ship-related oil spills on adjacent coastal zones. Ship-related accidents are one of the major factors causing potential oil spills in this area. A three dimensional oil transport and transformation model was developed using the Estuary, Coastal, and Ocean Model. This proposed model was run 90 times and each run lasted for 15 days to simulate the spread and weathering processes of oil for each of four potential spill sites, which represented potential sites of ship collisions along heavy traffic lanes in the Bohai Sea. Ten neighboring coastal areas were also considered as target zones that potentially could receive pollutants once oil spilled in the study areas. The statistical simulations showed that spills in winter were much worse than those in summer; they resulted in very negative effects on several specific target zones coded Z7, Z8, Z9, and Z10 in this paper. In addition, sites S3 (near the Penglai city) and S4 (near the Yantai city) were the two most at-risk sites with a significantly high probability of pollution if spills occurred nearby during winter. The results thus provided practical guidelines for local oil spill prevention, as well as an emergency preparedness and response program. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J,,,,,,,,,Keith Worden,,S^3 Disease Surveillance for Structures and Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 31 2013,2013,"One of the main contributors towards the cost of high-value engineering assets is the cost of maintenance. Taking an aircraft out of service for inspection means loss of revenue. However, the alternative - allowing damage to remove the aircraft from service - is much more undesirable with cost and safety being issues. In terms of an offshore wind farm, the cost of an unscheduled visit to a remote site to potentially replace a 75m blade hardly bears thinking about. If one can adopt a condition-based approach to maintenance where the structure of interest is monitored constantly by permanent sensors and data processing algorithms alert the owner or user when damage is developing, one can optimise the maintenance program for cost without sacrificing safety. If incipient damage is detected, repair rather than replacement can be a viable option.Unfortunately, the complexity of modern structures together with the challenging environments in which they operate makes it very difficult to develop data-processing algorithms which can detect and identify incipient damage. The discipline concerned with these problems - structural health monitoring (SHM) - suffers from serious problems which have prevented uptake of the technology by industry. The structural complexity makes analysis difficult; however, one variant of SHM - the data-based approach - shows promise in this respect. In this case one learns directly from data from the structure using pattern recognition techniques to diagnose different levels of damage. Sadly, data-based SHM has its own problems; the first is that most pattern recognition approaches to SHM require one to measure data from the structure in all possible states of damage. In the case of a structure like an aircraft - consider the A380 - it is simply not conceivable that one should damage a single one for data collection purposes, let alone many. Fortunately, if one is only interested simply in whether damage is present or not, this can be accomplished using only data from the healthy condition. One builds a picture of the healthy state of the structure and then monitors for deviations from this state. This raises the second major issue with data-based SHM; if one is monitoring the structure for changes, one does not wish to raise an alarm because of a benign change in its environmental or operational conditions; these are termed 'confounding influences'.The solution may lie within the healthcare informatics community. A field called 'syndromic surveillance' (SS) has arisen over the last 20 years concerned with fast detection of disease outbreaks by monitoring human populations. The data themselves can be very different, from over-the-counter medicine sales to numbers of hits on health advice websites. The data are fused together and analysed to give a spatio-temporal picture of public health and alerting algorithms similar to the ones used for SHM can be used to warn healthcare professionals that an epidemic may be on the way. The ideas have even been embedded in software, the prime example being the ESSENCE II system which keeps a watchful eye over three US states.The current proposal aims to develop a SS system for engineering structures with the capability of fast detection and location for faults on high-value assets. The population-based approach to SHM proposed here has the potential to solve the two problems discussed above. If many structures are monitored, inferences between structures can potentially avoid the need for very detailed knowledge of individual structures. As structures fail with time, the knowledge of damage states will build. In terms of the second problem, SS systems have always dealt with confounding influences and can provide inspiration for new algorithms for data-based SHM. As in the case of ESSENCE II; the system will be embedded in software so that multiple operators of structures can derive maximum benefit from the diagnostic capability of the population-based system.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/J016942/1,,,,,,,,University of Sheffield,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15337878,,

This research evaluated how two commercial, off-the-shelf water quality sensors responded to simulated surface water pollution events associated with Marcellus Shale development. First, peak concentrations of contaminants from typical spill events in monitored watersheds were estimated using regression techniques. Laboratory measurements were then conducted to determine how standard in-stream instrumentation that monitor conductivity, pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen responded to three potential spill materials: ethylene glycol (corrosion inhibitor), drilling mud, and produced water. Solutions ranging from 0 to 50 ppm of each spill material were assessed. Over this range, the specific conductivity increased on average by 19.9, 27.9, and 70 mu S/cm for drilling mud, ethylene glycol, and produced water, respectively. On average, minor changes in pH (0.5-0.8) and dissolved oxygen (0.13-0.23 ppm) were observed. While continuous monitoring may be part of the strategy for detecting spills to surface water, these minor impacts to water quality highlight the difficulty in detecting spill events. When practical, sensors should be placed at the mouths of small watersheds where drilling activities or spill risks are present, as contaminant travel distance strongly affects concentrations in surface water systems.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,0,8,,,0167-6369,1573-2959,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Energy Technol Lab, 3610 Collins Ferry Rd, Morgantown, WV 26507 USAWest Virginia Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 6103, Morgantown, WV 26506 USAUS Bur Reclamat, 555 Broadway NE, Albuquerque, NM 87102 USA",US Bur Reclamat,,,2016-12-14,WOS:000388202300048,27796832,

The burnt residues generated from ISB can have several toxic compounds and therefore their impacts on aquatic ecosystem are of major environmental concern. When quantifying the fate of the toxic compounds in ISB residues, C-30-alpha beta hopane is routinely used as a conservative biomarker since it has shown to be resistant to most natural weathering processes. However, a recent laboratory study has shown that C-30-alpha beta and other hopane compounds have the potential to degrade when crude oil was physically burnt under controlled conditions. When crude oil is burnt, the temperature of the oil can raise up to 350-500 degrees C; however, so far, no one has studied the fate of hopanes when crude oil is simply heated to very high temperatures. In this study, we hypothesize that heating crude oil to very high temperatures would result in the degradation of hopane compounds. Results of our study show that C-30-alpha beta hopane in crude oil will start to degrade at around 160 degrees C and the degradation pattern follows first order kinetics. Other types of hopanes and their diagnostic ratios can also change when the oil is exposed to severe heating conditions. We conclude that removal of hopane biomarkers via thermal degradation is a possible depletion pathway during ISB. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using hopanes as conservative biomarker compounds for characterizing ISB residues. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Its main effects are reducing production and increasing the risk of operational discontinuity due to shut down. In this paper, an advanced control process (APC) strategy is presented to deal with the slugging problem in oil wells. The strategy uses a two-layer coupled control structure: a regulatory via a PID control, and a supervisory via a model-based predictive control (MPC). The structure proposed was applied to a real ultra-deepwater well in Petrobras that was partially restricted by the choke valve to avoid the propagation of oscillatory behavior to the production system. As a result, the well has achieved a 10% oil production increase while maintaining the flow free of severe slugging, which meant an increment of about 240 barrels a day for that specific well.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,0967-0661,1873-6939,,,,,,,,,,"Petrobras SA, Res & Dev Ctr, BR-21941915 Rio De Janeiro, BrazilUniv Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Chem Engn Dept, BR-90040040 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",,,,2019-10-11,WOS:000487767000008,,

Despite this, relatively little data exists on the status of important contaminants of concern in this region. Here, we review the literature on the status of key persistent organic pollutants (POPs) of concern including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the YRD. Sources, source identification methods, and spatial distribution patterns are presented. Additionally, POPs contamination levels reported in the literature were evaluated against popular regulatory limits worldwide to form a basis for overall environmental health. Our review determined that OCPs in the YRD originated mainly from current pesticide use and past agricultural pesticide application. Sources of PAHs included petrochemical inputs, coal fired plants, and wood combustion. PCB levels were impacted by the petrochemical industry as well as waste disposal of PCB containing equipment. OCPs exhibited a spatial distribution pattern that increased along the urban-rural gradient, while the opposite was seen for PAHs and PCBs. Comparisons of POPs contamination levels in the YRD with popular regulatory limits suggest that the extent of PCB contamination all mediums (sediment, soil, water, and biota) exceeded that of PAHs and OCPs. Overall pollution levels in the YRD seem to be in control; however, levels from heavily polluted point sources raise numerous concerns about the ecological health of the region and require more attention from regulatory authorities.

In the first stage, a probabilistic analysis method is used to evaluate the failure probability of submarine landslide due to hydrate exploitation. The excess pore pressure due to hydrate exploitation is evaluated using a proposed maximum excess pore pressure model, which can consider the equilibrium of pressure and temperature for hydrates during decomposition. An infinite slope stability analysis and Monte Carlo simulations are then used to evaluate the failure probability of the slope with consideration of the generated excess pore pressure. In the second stage, a Bayesian network model to estimate the mortality rate of platform workers is proposed based on the logical sequence of events. The proposed approach is easy to implement and provides an efficient approach for quantitative assessment of human risk. Application of the proposed approach to a potential hydrate exploitation area, the Shenhu area in the South China Sea, is presented. The probabilistic analyses reveal that the production temperature T-1 and the slope angle beta have significant influences on the failure probability. Analysis of the human risk suggests that the key factors affecting the mortality rate are the distance of the platform to landslide and the equipment time for the workers to equip with lifejackets.",,,,,,,,,18,3,0,0,1,0,21,,,0141-1187,1879-1549,,,,,,,,,,"Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaCollaborat Innovat Ctr Adv Ship & Deep Sea Explor, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaTongji Univ, Dept Geotech Engn, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",,,,2020-06-09,WOS:000536121000008,,

Mesozoic rifting and passive margin development created ideal conditions for the deposition of world-class hydrocarbon source rocks. In the Cenozoic, transpressive, west-to-east movement of the Caribbean plate along the northern margin of Venezuela led to the maturation of those source rocks in several extended pulses, directly attributable to regional tectonic events. The combination of these elements with well-developed structural and stratigraphic fairways resulted in remarkably efficient migration of large volumes of oil and gas, which accumulated along the flanks of thick sedimentary depocenters.At least four proven and potential hydrocarbon source rocks contribute to oil and gas accumulations. Cretaceous oil-prone, marine source rocks, and Miocene oil- and gas-prone, paralic source rocks are well documented. We used reservoired oils, seeps, organic-rich rocks, and fluid inclusions to identify probable Jurassic hypersaline-lacustrine, and Albian carbonate source rocks. Hydrocarbon maturation began during the Early Miocene in the present-day Serrania del Interior, as the Caribbean plate moved eastward relative to South America. Large volumes of hydrocarbons expelled during this period were lost due to lack of effective traps and seals. By the Middle Miocene, however, when source rocks from the more recent foredeeps began to mature, reservoir, migration pathways, and topseal were in place. Rapid, tectonically driven burial created the opportunity for unusually efficient migration and trapping of these later-expelled hydrocarbons. The generally eastward migration of broad depocenters across Venezuela was supplemented by local, tectonically induced subsidence. These subsidence patterns and later migration resulted in the mixing of hydrocarbons from different source rocks, and in a complex map pattern of variable oil quality that was further modified by biodegradation, late gas migration, water washing, and subsequent burial.The integration of plate tectonic reconstructions with the history of source rock deposition and maturation provides significant insights into the genesis, evolution, alteration, and demise of Eastern Venezuela hydrocarbon systems. We used this analysis to identify additional play potential associated with probable Jurassic and Albian hydrocarbon source rocks, often overlooked in discussions of Venezuela. The results suggest that oils associated with likely Jurassic source rocks originated in restricted, rift-controlled depressions lying at high angles to the eventual margins of the South Atlantic, and that Albian oils are likely related to carbonate deposition along these margins, post-continental break up. In terms of tectonic history, the inferred Mesozoic rift system is the eastern continuation of the Espino Graben, whose remnant structures underlie both the Serrania del Interior and the Gulf of Paria, where thick evaporite sections have been penetrated. The pattern of basin structure and associated Mesozoic deposition as depicted in the model has important implications for the Mesozoic paleogeography of northern South America and Africa, Cuba and the Yucatan and associated new play potential.

Here we explore whether negative emissions are indeed effective in reversing climate change on human timescales, given the potentially counteracting effect of natural carbon sinks and the inertia of the climate system. We designed a range of CO2 emission scenarios, which follow a gradual transition to a zero-carbon energy system and entail implementation of various amounts of net-negative emissions at technologically plausible rates. These scenarios are used to force an Earth System Model of intermediate complexity. Results suggest that while it is possible to revert to a desired level of warming (e.g. 2 degrees C above pre-industrial) after different levels of overshoot, thermosteric sea level rise is not reversible for at least several centuries, even under assumption of large amounts of negative CO2 emissions.

Native plant species richness was higher in remnant vegetation than in revegetation and plantation sites in the southern MLR, but only remnant and plantation sites were different in the northern MLR. Native bird species richness was higher in remnant than plantation sites, but revegetation sites were similar to both plantation and remnant sites in northern and southern sites. Mean total standing carbon varied across treatments in southern sites, and there were no statistically significant differences in mean carbon sequestration rate between planted treatments. Monoculture plantation sites lack the structural complexity required and offer limited resources for native fauna compared with mixed-species revegetation or remnant vegetation. This reinforces the importance of carefully constructed incentives to compensate landholders for potential carbon shortfalls if the opportunity for biodiversity gains from carbon plantings is to be realised in the longer term.

Technical description Microbial communities inhabiting the Earth?s subsurface occupy a scientifically uncharted realm. The habitable subsurface may penetrate the Earth?s crust to depths of 5?10 km, depending on geothermal gradients. It has been estimated recently that the deep subsurface habitat could accommodate more biomass and biodiversity than on Earth?s surface. Yet, we know little about carbon cycling, nitrogen cycling, or any other biogeochemical cycling that takes place in this subsurface biosphere or how these may impact surface processes. This project will investigate these processes in high pH fluids found in ophiolite regions of the Philippines, where active sepentinization brings H2 and CH4 in contact with formation fluids, energizing the subsurface biosphere. This proposed research will deliver baseline biogeochemical data for a suite of high pH serpentinizing springs in two Philippines ophiolite localities (Zambales and Palawan). In a focused two-year research plan, we will elucidate biogeochemical cycling in high pH, deeply sourced fluids in our Philippines field locations, and tie the role of microorganisms directly to biogeochemical processes. Our three parallel research strands involve whether (1) deeply sourced, ophiolite-derived fluids afford habitable niches for chemolithotrophic microbial communities that can be predicted by the geochemistry of the system, (2) nucleic acid based analyses and culturing approaches reflect functional genetic competence that confirms the predicted metabolic strategies, and (3) chemoheterotrophic metabolisms and/or methanotrophs dominate over alternative chemoautotrophic metabolisms in these subsurface fluids, due to low CO2 and bicarbonate in the Philippine high pH fluids. This project also comprises intentional mentorship of graduate and undergraduate students in field, laboratory, and analytical methods, and the development of a blended specimen- and web-based learning module tying together field findings with science education initiatives at the collegiate and high school levels, particularly with the Earth Science Literacy Initiative goals in mind (http://www.earthscienceliteracy.org. Scientific and societal broader impacts include support for life on the Early Earth and other planetary bodies, as it has been proposed that serpentinization (the aqueous alteration of ultramafic rocks, yielding diatomic hydrogen, and possibly complex organic molecules) can provide critical energy, and carbon to primitive ecosystems. These processes likely continue to support life in ?extreme? subsurface settings on the modern Earth. Ophiolite regions are also of great interest to researchers investigating the possibilities of long term carbon storage in serpentinites, as geological repositories of CO2. Because secondary mineralogy resembles concrete, ophiolites are also gaining attention as potential radioactive waste depositories. With these diverse impacts in mind, a better concept of biogeochemical cycling in ophiolite-hosted fluids is necessary to understand potential impacts for these applications. Part B. Non-technical explanation of the project?s broader significance and importance Microbial communities inhabiting the Earth?s subsurface occupy a scientifically uncharted realm, and may penetrate the Earth?s crust to depths of 5 to 10 km--until it is too hot to survive. It has been estimated recently that the deep subsurface habitat could accommodate more biomass and biodiversity than on Earth?s surface, and the impact of this vast reservoir of biomass on biogeochemical cycling on Earth is a gaping hole in our current knowledge of Earth systems. This project will investigate how life transforms water and rock in high pH springs at two localities in the Philippines, at Zambales and Palawan, and allow us to learn more about critical chemical and biological connections in ways that may serve both science (particularly in defining the unknown edge of the biosphere in these exciting settings?including how microbes survive in low oxygen, low nutrient settings) and society (with strong links to ongoing experiments in carbon sequestration, toxic waste storage, bioremediation of mining wastes, and micro-scale medical applications). Dr. Meyer-Dombard?s research focus has been the geobiology of terrestrial and shallow submarine hydrothermal systems, and Dr. Cardace has studied the geobiology of tectonic margins, with field localities in the seabed and coastal settings. Together in this collaborative research project, they intend to learn how Earth is evolving in concert with life in ways that impact reservoirs of carbon and other elements. They bring a commitment to mentorship and training in research to the table also, and the funds granted here will allow more students to gain skills including quantitative reasoning, analytical research, and science writing, and materials and findings will be rapidly shared with in service teachers and their students through school visits and interactive, data-rich on-line modules.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1146910,,,,,,,,University of Rhode Island,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13759674,,

Up until recently, harsh year-long environmental conditions have significantly hindered the necessary access and transport connections in the Arctic. Even in the case that weather conditions did permit vessels' passage, unreliable navigational aids and lack of infrastructure/support provided obstacles difficult to overcome. However, environmental data recorded during the last couple of decades clearly indicates that there is a continuous decline of ice coverage in the High North. Given this steady decline, the Arctic has now been viewed as a promising field for economic activities and is considered as a potential connecting corridor between Asia and Europe/America (and vice-versa). As human presence and operations are expected to intensify there, it is of utmost importance to evaluate the current level of support towards ships that will be crossing the region; capabilities in relation to search and rescue (SAR) operations and oil spill response are also important.

Through an extensive literature review that includes numerous internet resources, the current analysis will identify the numbers of icebreakers already operating in the NSR, as well as those that will be commissioned into service in the near future. The choice to research the specific type of vessels is supported by a simple argument: icebreakers currently are and will continue to be in the foreseeable future the main tool to support shipping activities in the Arctic. Furthermore, emergency management capabilities in the Russian Arctic will be examined to include the current state of rescue coordination centres along with the availability of SAR assets. Additionally, the efforts thus far by the Arctic Council to increase coordination and interaction among the States involved in Arctic affairs will be summarized; the latter will be achieved via a brief review of a very important legally binding agreement: the search and rescue instrument. In conclusion, the Russian State has already heavily invested in icebreakers' building and their current number is fully capable to handle the present level of limited traffic. On the other hand, ships are currently faced with long distances to cross (often without adequate support) adverse environmental conditions, unpredictable hurdles, and slow response times in case of an emergency. Therefore, in case ships operating in the region are increased, it will be difficult to deal with all the additional demands for support. Of particular interest is the fact that considering the vast area of the NSR, the overall available response capabilities in the region under discussion are rather thin; any further increase of maritime traffic in the High North must be balanced with additional strengthening of emergency management capabilities.In any case, should the NSR become fully integrated in the global maritime transport system, Russia's geopolitical status will be clearly improved and further research is needed to discuss the implications both at the regional and global levels.",,,,,,,,,10,1,0,0,0,0,11,,,1651-436X,1654-1642,,,,,,,,,,"WMU, Malmo, SwedenUS Coast Guard Secondment, Martin Luther King Jr Ave SE, Washington, DC USA",WMUUS Coast Guard Secondment,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000436456200001,,

For active vibration control of offshore platforms with sampling measurements, to deal with the missing measurements, a robust sampled-data H-infinity control method is proposed in this paper. The robust sampled-data H-infinity state feedback controller is obtained in terms of the solvability of certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

Here, we present a modelling approach that assesses the relative impact of disturbances on carbon storage and sequestration, and how this will alter under climate change. Our case study is semi-arid Australia where large areas of land are managed to offset over 122 million tonnes of anthropogenic carbon emissions over a 100-year period. These carbon offsets include mature vegetation that has been protected from clearing and regenerating vegetation on degraded agricultural land. We use a Bayesian Network model to combine multiple probabilistic models of the risk posed by fire, drought, grazing and recruitment failure to carbon dynamics. The model is parameterised from a review of relevant literature and additional quantitative analyses presented here. We found that the risk of vegetation becoming a net source of carbon due to a mortality event, or failing to realise maximum sequestration potential, through recruitment failure in regenerating vegetation, was primarily a function of rainfall in this semi-arid environment. However, the relative size of an emissions event varied across vegetation communities depending on plant attributes, specifically resprouting capacity. Modelled climate change effects were variable, depending on the climate change projection used. Under 'best-case' or 'most-likely' climate scenarios for 2050, similar or increased projections of mean annual precipitation, associated with a build-up of fuel, were expected to drive an increase in fire activity (a 40-160% increase), but a decrease in drought (a 20-35% decrease). Under a 'worst-case' climate scenario, fire activity was expected to decline (a 37% decrease), but drought conditions remain similar (a 5% decrease). These projected changes to the frequency of drought and fire increase the risk that vegetation used for carbon offsetting will fail to provide anticipated amounts of carbon abatement over their lifetime.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,6,0,12,,,0301-4797,1095-8630,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, AustraliaWestern Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, AustraliaGreenCollar, Sydney, NSW 2000, AustraliaClimate Res, New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Orange, NSW 2800, AustraliaCSIRO Land & Water, Sandy Bay, Tas 7005, AustraliaUniv New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, AustraliaCSIRO Land & Water Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2601, AustraliaQueensland Herbarium, Toowong, Qld 4066, Australia",GreenCollarQueensland Herbarium,,,2019-04-01,WOS:000459527800054,30711835,

Funded through the European Commission 7(th) Framework Programme [1] (grant agreement 213380), this (sic)5.5 million project aims to produce a suite of protocols that will enable a broad range of stakeholders to judge the variety of technologies in wave and tidal energy on a level playing field. The protocols will reflect the entire development cycle of a marine device: resource assessment and site selection; fundamental engineering design; scaling up and deployment; environmental impact and economic assessment. The project has now been running for 12 months.This paper reviews the intended work over the three year project, but focuses on the development of high level documents that will describe the aims and remit of the individual protocols. The high level protocols were conceived to meet two fundamental requirements. EquiMar is an ambitious project in terms of both scope and number of collaborators. There is a need to maintain consistency and clarity as each protocol/guideline is developed. The high level protocols will serve as a template for the detailed specifications, clarifying content, identifying gaps and links within the overall work and finally will help to maintain focus on the final goals. Externally the high level documents will provide a mechanism for engagement of the many stakeholders. Early feedback on the direction and coverage of the protocols is fundamental to achieving, where practica, a consensus from the diverse ocean energy community. Based on the practices of an international Certifying Agency (DNV) it is intended that the protocols will be fit for guidance and incorporation into proposed international standards.This paper aims to increase dissemination and provoke comment from the International marine community in order that that the final documents will be fit for purpose by reflecting the considered opinion of as wide a body of relevant contributors as is possible, and act as a catalyst to help deliver the potential for marine renewable energy on the international stage.",,,,,"28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Honolulu, HIHonolulu, HI",1,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,978-0-7918-4344-4,,,,,,,,,"Univ Exeter, Sch Geog Archeol & Earth Resources, Exeter TR10 9EZ, Devon, England",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000286404300119,,

A number of authors have posed concern over the thousands of injection wells likely to be needed. However, a more important criterion than the number of wells is whether the total cost of storing the CO2, is market-bearable. Previous studies have sought to determine the number of injection wells required to achieve a specified storage target. Here an alternative methodology is presented whereby we specify a maximum allowable cost (MAC) per ton of CO2 stored, a priori, and determine the corresponding potential operational storage capacity. The methodology takes advantage of an analytical solution for pressure buildup during CO2 injection into a cylindrical saline formation, accounting for two-phase flow, brine evaporation, and salt precipitation around the injection well. The methodology is applied to 375 saline formations from the U.K. Continental Shelf. Parameter uncertainty is propagated using Monte Carlo simulation with 10 000 realizations for each formation. The results show that MAC affects both the magnitude and spatial distribution of potential operational storage capacity on a national scale. Different storage prospects can appear more or less attractive depending on the MAC scenario considered. It is also shown that, under high well-injection rate scenarios with relatively low cost, there is adequate operational storage capacity for the equivalent of 40 years of U.K. CO2 emissions.",,,,,,,,,11,1,0,0,1,0,11,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Durham, Dept Earth Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, EnglandCarbon Capture & Storage Programme, London W1S 2HX, EnglandHeriot Watt Univ, Inst Petr Engn, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",Carbon Capture & Storage Programme,,,2015-12-16,WOS:000365151200048,26480926,

Swamp sediment structure has a direct link to the high water tables, element cycling and carbon sequestration that are the characteristic functions of these systems. By comparing the sediment structure of intact swamps and channelised fills, we can gain an understanding of how changes in swamp geomorphology change both swamp structure and function. We examined the sedimentology of six intact and six channelised fill swamps in the Blue Mountains NSW, Australia. There were significant differences in texture, unit thickness, Carbon: Nitrogen (C:N) ratios and moisture content between intact swamps and channelised fills. The presence and thickness of unmodified contemporary sand layers in almost all channelised fills and its absence in almost all intact swamps was a distinctive structural difference. The two functional swamp layers, in terms of water and carbon storage were almost double the mean thickness in intact swamps than in channelised fills. Moisture content was 30% higher in intact swamps than in channelised fills. Mean C:N ratios for channelised fills were 25% lower than that of intact swamps. Peat forming potential, as defined by C:N ratios >27, started at a greater depth in the sediment profile (0.9 m lower) in channelised fills than in intact swamps. It is clear from this study that these structural and functional indicators are important for assessing swamp condition and can also be useful in designing monitoring programs for management and rehabilitation that target key structural attributes that produce and maintain swamp function.

An investigation of Stoppard’s plays leading to this trilogy reveals that he is consistently acute in his understanding of the outcomes of political suppression. The focus on breaches of human rights under the Tsars (and implied parallels in post-revolution Russia) is thus present in Every Good Boy Deserves Favour and Professional Foul (1977), and had already been hinted at in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (1967), in which the two innocent protagonists are victimized by the state. In Stoppard’s trilogy, history, politics and theatre intermingle in increasingly complex transformations of each other. The study concludes that as with his other plays, The Coast of Utopia offers a philosophical statement about contemporary life and on the emptiness of an ideology which has lost touch with reality. Furthermore, the examination of Stoppard’s output to date shows that a high percentage of his plays deal with the history of political struggle and Eastern Europe in particular.

The analysis showed that the fixed or hinged connection condition between the piles and the platform altered the values and distribution of displacements, normal force, bending moments, and shear forces along the length of each pile. The distribution of piles in the pile group affects the stress distribution on both the soil and platform. The piles were found to suffer from displacement failure rather than force failure. Moreover, the resulting bending stresses on the reinforced concrete plate in the case of a fixed connection between the piles and the platform were almost doubled and much higher than the allowable reinforced concrete stress and even exceeded the ultimate design strength and thus the environmental loads acting on a pile-supported riverine offshore platform may cause collapse if they are not properly considered in the structural analysis and design.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,2079-3197,,,,,,,,,,,"Technol Educ Inst Western Greece, Dept Civil Engn, GR-26334 Patras, GreeceSohag Univ, Fac Ind Educ, Dept Civil & Architectural Construct, Sohag 82524, Egypt",,,,2018-02-19,WOS:000424146900007,,

In addition to high-resolution bathymetry, most modern multibeam sonar systems also provide sonar backscatter data, an indicator of surficial texture or material type. These data sets are combined with high-resolution seismic, standard sidescan and ground truth (coring or geotechnical) data to allow the marine engineer to make optimal judgments about the route of a submarine pipeline or cable. Huge volumes of data are generated by the different survey systems, often running into hundreds of megabytes. Typically this data is only available to engineer in the form of a paper atlas with each type of data presented separately. The route planners must mentally integrate these complex data sets into a three dimensional model from which they can choose the best path for a cable or pipeline. They must also then justify this route to managers who may, or may not, have the experience necessary to do this data fusion.We will present a suite of software tools (The Fledermaus Toolkit) designed to present data in a three dimensional visual format, allow its interactive exploration, and to quantitatively interrogate the data within the 3-D space for geographic information and other attributes (depth, gradients, etc.). The system allows the user to freely ''fly'' around and through the data space with a six-degree of freedom mouse (The Bat) that uses natural hand motions to provide an intuitive interface for data exploration. This interactive exploration is the key to understanding complex spatial relationships. Sophisticated shading algorithms and stereoscopic viewing facilitate the understanding of the 3D surface topography and subsurface relationships.Many different types of 3D objects can be incorporated into a ''scene''. Thus it is possible to have digital elevation maps draped with sonar backscatter, sub-bottom seismic data, boreholes, and the planned pipeline integrated together. All of these are gee-referenced and spatial queries allow for 3D position information or other attributes to be extracted from any 3D perspective view.Cable and pipeline routes are planned interactively by simply drawing the route on the seabed and adjusting the route as needed. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional views of the route are simultaneously available when necessary. Profile information along the route is provided from a separate window as are slope and gradient information. The 3D data can also be integrated with real-time navigation inputs during the cable laying operations. This allows for the ship and plow position to be viewed in the 3D scene presenting both a 2D and 3D image of the terrain that is about to be encountered by both the plow and the vessel.The system has been used for a number of commercial applications and examples of these will be presented.",,,,,Oceans 97 MTS/IEEE ConferenceOceans 97 MTS/IEEE Conference,"OCT 06-09, 1997OCT 06-09, 1997",IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; Marine Technol SocIEEE Ocean Engn Soc; Marine Technol Soc,"HALIFAX, CANADAHALIFAX, CANADA",3,0,0,0,1,0,3,,,,,0-7803-4108-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,1997-01-01,WOS:A1997BJ68T00215,,

Early docking work was motivated by the desire to operate AUVs for multiple sorties without recovery or human servicing of the AUV. To accomplish this, the docking system provides a method for the AUV to find the dock, to physically attach, to recharge AUV batteries, to establish a communication link, to wait in a low power state for a new mission, and to undock. A variety of homing methods, dock configurations, power transfer approaches, and communications links have been employed to achieve these respective needs, and are described herein. While the original applications driving docking were oceanographic in nature, present interest is broader, driven by commercial and military applications as well. Docking has been demonstrated, but has not been deployed as an operational capability, in part because docking requires an infrastructure for the dock that provides physical mounting, a source of power, and communication connectivity. The advent of cabled and mooring-based observatories, and subsea infrastructure for oil and gas production, create a foundation supporting docking system deployment. Consequently, the prospects for operational docking systems seem promising.",,,,,,,,,23,1,0,0,1,0,24,,,,,978-3-319-16649-0; 978-3-319-16648-3,,,,,,,,,"Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, 266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",,,,2016-12-14,WOS:000385959700019,,
J,,,,,,,,,"Meyer-Dombard, D'Arcy",,Collaborative Research: Geobiology of high pH springs in the Philippines - probing the deep biosphere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Feb 15 2012,2012,"Part A. Technical description Microbial communities inhabiting the Earth?s subsurface occupy a scientifically uncharted realm. The habitable subsurface may penetrate the Earth?s crust to depths of 5?10 km, depending on geothermal gradients. It has been estimated recently that the deep subsurface habitat could accommodate more biomass and biodiversity than on Earth?s surface. Yet, we know little about carbon cycling, nitrogen cycling, or any other biogeochemical cycling that takes place in this subsurface biosphere or how these may impact surface processes. This project will investigate these processes in high pH fluids found in ophiolite regions of the Philippines, where active sepentinization brings H2 and CH4 in contact with formation fluids, energizing the subsurface biosphere. This proposed research will deliver baseline biogeochemical data for a suite of high pH serpentinizing springs in two Philippines ophiolite localities (Zambales and Palawan). In a focused two-year research plan, we will elucidate biogeochemical cycling in high pH, deeply sourced fluids in our Philippines field locations, and tie the role of microorganisms directly to biogeochemical processes. Our three parallel research strands involve whether (1) deeply sourced, ophiolite-derived fluids afford habitable niches for chemolithotrophic microbial communities that can be predicted by the geochemistry of the system, (2) nucleic acid based analyses and culturing approaches reflect functional genetic competence that confirms the predicted metabolic strategies, and (3) chemoheterotrophic metabolisms and/or methanotrophs dominate over alternative chemoautotrophic metabolisms in these subsurface fluids, due to low CO2 and bicarbonate in the Philippine high pH fluids. This project also comprises intentional mentorship of graduate and undergraduate students in field, laboratory, and analytical methods, and the development of a blended specimen- and web-based learning module tying together field findings with science education initiatives at the collegiate and high school levels, particularly with the Earth Science Literacy Initiative goals in mind (http://www.earthscienceliteracy.org. Scientific and societal broader impacts include support for life on the Early Earth and other planetary bodies, as it has been proposed that serpentinization (the aqueous alteration of ultramafic rocks, yielding diatomic hydrogen, and possibly complex organic molecules) can provide critical energy, and carbon to primitive ecosystems. These processes likely continue to support life in ?extreme? subsurface settings on the modern Earth. Ophiolite regions are also of great interest to researchers investigating the possibilities of long term carbon storage in serpentinites, as geological repositories of CO2. Because secondary mineralogy resembles concrete, ophiolites are also gaining attention as potential radioactive waste depositories. With these diverse impacts in mind, a better concept of biogeochemical cycling in ophiolite-hosted fluids is necessary to understand potential impacts for these applications. Part B. Non-technical explanation of the project?s broader significance and importance Microbial communities inhabiting the Earth?s subsurface occupy a scientifically uncharted realm, and may penetrate the Earth?s crust to depths of 5 to 10 km--until it is too hot to survive. It has been estimated recently that the deep subsurface habitat could accommodate more biomass and biodiversity than on Earth?s surface, and the impact of this vast reservoir of biomass on biogeochemical cycling on Earth is a gaping hole in our current knowledge of Earth systems. This project will investigate how life transforms water and rock in high pH springs at two localities in the Philippines, at Zambales and Palawan, and allow us to learn more about critical chemical and biological connections in ways that may serve both science (particularly in defining the unknown edge of the biosphere in these exciting settings?including how microbes survive in low oxygen, low nutrient settings) and society (with strong links to ongoing experiments in carbon sequestration, toxic waste storage, bioremediation of mining wastes, and micro-scale medical applications). Dr. Meyer-Dombard?s research focus has been the geobiology of terrestrial and shallow submarine hydrothermal systems, and Dr. Cardace has studied the geobiology of tectonic margins, with field localities in the seabed and coastal settings. Together in this collaborative research project, they intend to learn how Earth is evolving in concert with life in ways that impact reservoirs of carbon and other elements. They bring a commitment to mentorship and training in research to the table also, and the funds granted here will allow more students to gain skills including quantitative reasoning, analytical research, and science writing, and materials and findings will be rapidly shared with in service teachers and their students through school visits and interactive, data-rich on-line modules.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1147334,,,,,,,,University of Illinois at Chicago,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13652326,,

An experimental seawater microcosm, supplemented with crude oil and EPS2003 (SW + OIL + EPS2003), was monitored for 15 days and compared to control microcosm (only oil-polluted seawater, SW + OIL). Determination of bacterial abundance, heterotrophic cultivable and hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were carried out during all experimentation period. The microbial community dynamic was monitored by isolation of total RNA, RT-PCR amplification of 16S rRNA, cloning and sequencing. Oil degradation was monitored by GC MS analysis. Bioemulsificant addition stimulated an increase of the total bacterial abundance, change in the community structure and activity. The bioemulsificant also increased of 5 times the oil biodegradation rate.The data obtained from microcosm experiment indicated that EPS2003 could be used for the dispersion of oil slicks and could stimulate the selection of marine hydrocarbon degraders thus increasing bioremediation process.

The biggest challenge relates to the scaling up of the power capture interface (device level) and new approaches to the station keeping system (physical environment) which in turn is governed by the characteristics of the resource. In order to achieve technology cost reduction, it is envisaged that the development of marine renewable will emulate the development practices adopted in the early days of the wind energy industry and embark on building and deploying larger diameter rotors to increase device capacity and through this deliver lower unit costs. The challenge however relates to managing the resulting consequences on structural loadings. These increase with the square of the diameter of rotors/ power capture interface. As such, this approach will result in the materials used in the power capture interface operating under very high loading conditions.Evidence to date indicates that all large horizontal axis rotor systems greater than 15m diameter, which have been deployed in full scale tidal environments, have succumbed to catastrophic rotor blade failure. Hence, there is a serious Materials challange in developing more robust materials for the operating environment.

Gold Coast, Australia, ISSN 0749.0208Coastal wetland loss in southern Louisiana poses a great threat to the region's ecologic and economic stability. Wetland loss in the Louisiana Coastal Zone is caused by the interactions of multiple natural and human induced mechanisms, and it has been suggested that subsurface oil and gas production may be a large contributing factor. We model the effect of oil and gas production in Lafourche Parrish, Louisiana on surface subsidence using a first-order leveling line along highway Louisiana 1 to constrain our model. Using geologic and pressure data, we estimate the amount of compaction in modeled reservoirs. We find the subsidence predicted from reservoir compaction is consistent with observations of localized subsidence between 1982 and 1993. Both modeling and observations show that subsidence due to reservoir compaction is a highly localized signal that is not consistent with observations of regional subsidence. Interestingly, while predictions of subsidence from compaction of the reservoir sands fit the observed subsidence in one time epoch, the leveling data shows an increasing rate of subsidence from the 1965-1982 to 1982-1993 epoch - a time when production rates decreased. This indicates the potential for a time-dependent mechanism for production-induced subsidence.

Depressurization is considered a fundamental method of producing natural gas from gas hydrate-bearing sediments (GHESs). However, soil compaction during depressurization is a significant problem for production efficiency and safety. The compressibility of soil affects the hydrate dissociation in the coupled process of heat transfer, fluid flow, and soil compaction. In this study, a fully coupled Thermohydro-chemo-mechanical (THCM) model is applied to simulate Masuda's core-scale gas production experiments. The effects of compressibility on the changes in gas production rate, pore pressure, temperature, hydrate saturation, permeability, and heat conductivity are investigated by varying the parameters governing compressibility including the bulk modulus of host sediments and hydrate-enhanced bulk modulus. The results show that the higher compressibility corresponds to a larger reduction in porosity further impacting the variation in effective permeability, heat conductivity, and heat convection during depressurization. In Masuda's test, the pressure changes indicate that the soil compaction might occurs during depressurization. Because the real field production is implemented under confining condition, Masuda's test should be developed to consider the compressibility of GHBSs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Four years of field observations informing the fate and transport of DWH SRBs in Alabama's beach system are presented here, along with a conceptual framework for describing their physical evolution processes. The observation data show that SRBs containing MC252 residues currently remain in Alabama's beach system, although their relationship to SOMs is not fully known.

The dynamic stiffness of synthetic rope is modelled as upper-lower critical stiffness model. The upper critical stiffness is used to calculate the motions, while the lower critical stiffness is for the line tension.

Based on the current data from SELFE and wave data from SWAN, the oil spill model utilizes oil particle method to predict the trajectory of individual droplets and the oil concentration. Compared with the observations in Dalian New Port oil spill event, the developed model taking into account wave-current coupling administers to giving better conformity than the one without.

The Cretaceous Denglouku Formation can be divided into four third-order sequences. Each sequence consists of two systems tracts: a transgressive systems tract and a high-stand systems tract. A braided river delta is the main sedimentary facies in the study interval. These sequences were deposited in a back-arc rift basin during a transitional period from fault-dominant subsidence to downwarp subsidence. A sequence stratigraphic model is discussed based on the above interpretations. Typical unconformities are absent due to the absence of base level fall. Instead, maximum regressive surfaces, which are generally reworked by transgressive ravinement, act as the sequence boundaries. Each sequence bounded by these surfaces can be divided into two depositional units: a transgressive unit (TST) and normal regressive unit (HST). On land, a TST is characterized by a decreasing channel/floodplain ratio, and an HST is characterized by an increasing channel/floodplain ratio. Lakes are analogs to marine settings in which the shoreline moves forwards and backwards, and their strata show alternating retrogradation and progradation patterns. The results of this study may encourage the application of similar approaches to the correlation of successions within and beyond the Songliao Basin. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Several numerical experiments were performed in order to select the most appropriate lattice and to decide between the single- and two-relaxation time models. Large-scale oil spills require simulations with short computational times. In order to speed up the computation and preserve adequate accuracy of the model, five different flux limiting interpolation techniques were compared and evaluated. The model was validated on the Lebanon oil spill with regard to the oil-slick position and concentrations in the sea, and the beaching area on the coast. Good agreement with satellite images of the slick and field data on beaching was achieved. The main advantages of the applied method are the capability of simulating very low oil concentrations and computational times that are by an order of magnitude shorter compared to similar models.

In this time interval, the Mezardere Formation was deposited in the Early Oligocene (36 m.y.) through Middle Oligocene (30 m.y.). Mezardere Formation is characterized by thick marine-prodelta organic rich shales, marls and sandstones. Present and previous research results showed that the Mezardere Shale contains marine Type II+III kerogen (HI=3-744 mg HC/g TOC) and sufficient organic richness (TOC=0.08-3.39 wt%) and has favorable thermal maturity (%VRm = 0.35-1.20) in order to generate oil, condensate as well as wet-gas. Furthermore, discoveries of conventional oil, condensate and wet-gas and correlation of these fluids with the Mezardere Shale gives us a confidence that Mezardere Shale may retain hydrocarbon fluids and could be a significant shale-oil play in the Thrace Basin. Hence, the aim of this study is to estimate oil in-place (OLP) resource volume in the Mezardere Shale. For this purpose, available Rock-Eval data acquired from 407 Mezardere Shale cuttings and core samples from 47 wells are studied and evaluated.Five out of 47 wells show relatively continuous Oil Saturation Index, (OSI=S1/TOC*100) values. It is crucial to note that measured S1 and therefore OSI values are corrected against the evaporation loss. Corrections are made for 35, 40, and 45 API oils which are assumed to be present in the Mezardere Shale as retained oil. OIP resource estimations are conducted for the five wells as well as for the determined core area (e.g., 1000 km(2) in the northwestern Thrace Basin). An average Mean Swanson's value of OIP's of the five wells is estimated to be approximately 405 M bbl. The core area shows an average Mean Swanson's value of OIP as 325 MM bbl. (C) 2015 Elsevier By.

Particularly so after the Macondo disaster, BOPs have been the center of regulatory change and sector development. BOP availability and reliability become even more important as drilling advances into deep and ultra-deep water offshore fields. The BOP configuration choice for such variable environments will have far reaching consequences. Reliability, though hugely important and vital, is one of the several criteria that operators must use for determining the most cost-effective configuration as the cost of accidents in deeper waters increases proportionately. In the current paper, an integrated framework for the selection of the most appropriate BOP configuration in deep and ultra-deep water conditions is proposed. The framework captures all evaluation criteria such as BOP reliability, handling/deployability, overall weight and CAPEX/OPEX ratio. Appropriate mathematical and evaluation tools such as Bayesian Network (BN) and Lifecycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) are employed to evaluate different configurations. The models are applied to a commonly used CLASS VII subsea BOPs in deeper waters. The results indicate that configuration 1 (with 2 annular, 2 pipe rams, 1 blind shear ram, 1 casing shear ram) is slightly less reliable than configuration 2 (with 1 annular, 2 pipe rams, 1 blind shear ram, 2 casing shear rams), however, the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are higher for the latter configuration.

In this regard, in this study, noting that the recent CCUS policies and systems of European countries such as the UK, Germany, and Norway are showing significant changes from a negative or reserved position to an active position, we wished help the improvement of the implementation of CCUS and carbon emission trading systems in Korea. It is especially intended to help with legislative policies that can be considered. The attitude of the EU, which has been known and organized in Korea, should be revised from a negative or reserved position to a positive position.As a first change, the EU presents a big picture of achieving overall CO2 reduction by transporting and storing carbon dioxide, which is generated a lot in European industrial areas, to non-industrial areas such as the Norwegian sea.As a second change, the carbon reduced through CCUS is exchanged for carbon credits, thereby creating a new environmental market by actively linking the environment and the market. Carbon dioxide reduction through CCUS was evaluated as an incentive through the carbon emission trading system, and it was possible to create huge profits as well as profits through industrial product production. The cap-and-trade method and the baseline and credit method are discussed, but tax benefits may also be added. The huge environmental market is growing continuously and effectively.This change in Europe can be said to present the following policy tasks to us.First, looking at the changes in European CCS and CCU legal policies and the full-fledged implementation of the carbon emission trading system, we must pursue the same legal policy goals in common. To do so, it is necessary to continuously prove and persuade through scientific and objective evidence to respond well to the increased public interest in CCUS.Second, the responsiveness and adaptability of climate change must be promoted by connecting the environment and the market as seen in the carbon emission trading system. We must not promote only microscopic reductions of carbon dioxide directly, but in combination with the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we must make macroscopic changes in the direction of replacing or reducing carbon dioxide in industrial and social structures. The responsiveness of the former and the adaptability of the latter must be promoted in a harmonious manner.Third, it is necessary to clarify the responsibilities of the operators of CO2 storage facilities, regardless of state agencies, gas infrastructure companies or exploration and production companies. In order to better develop the finance, insurance and markets related to CCUS, the responsibilities of those involved must also be clearer.Fourth, it is necessary to ensure that CCS and CCU technologies and projects are suitable for public support systems that can be used in various stages of development, including R&D, demonstration projects, and initial infrastructure construction. It is important to make it recognizable that the CCS and CCU are economic activities contributing to climate change mitigation in a taxonomy developed in the context of the Action Plan on Sustainable Finance.Fifth, cooperation between countries is necessary in the international community. In Europe, in order to achieve the EU 2050 climate ambitions, Member States have developed specific deployment strategies and support policies of the country and NECP (Clean Energy for all Europeans Package-) for CCS and CCU. Explain that they are doing and are seeking cooperation.Sixth, cooperation of all parties related to the environmental chain is necessary. Encourage the promotion of appropriate geological and infrastructure information sharing among countries, institutions and companies involved in the environmental chain, and encourage the development of CO2 storage maps for appropriate storage complexes.Seventh, public financial support is needed until economies of scale are achieved, especially in the early stages of building the CCS and CCU value chains.Recognizing these changes in the EU's CCUS, and referring to implications, domestic legislation should be promoted quickly and concretely.",,,,"그린뉴딜이 기후변화 문제를 해결하기 위한 최근의 중요한 논의로서 강조되고 있다. 이와 관련하여 이번 연구에서는 영국, 독일, 노르웨이 등 유럽국가들의 최근 CCUS 정책과 제도 등이 부정적이거나 유보적인 입장에서 적극적인 입장으로 크게 변화를 보이고 있다는 점에 주목하여 우리나라에서 CCUS 추진과 탄소배출거래제 실시에 고려할 수 있는 입법정책에 도움을 주고자 하였다. 국내에서 그동안 알고 정리했던 EU의 태도는 부정적이거나 유보적인 입장에서 긍정적인 입장으로 수정되어야 한다.첫 번째 변화로서 EU에서는 유럽의 공업지역에서 많이 발생하는 이산화탄소를 노르웨이의 바다와 같은 비공업지역으로 수송하고 저장하도록 하여 전체적인 이산화탄소감축량을 달성하려는 큰 그림을 제시하고 있다.두 번째 변화로서 CCUS를 통하여 감축된 탄소를 탄소배출권으로 교환하여 줌으로써 환경과 시장을 적극적으로 연동시켜 새로운 환경시장을 창출하고 있다. CCUS를 통한 이산화탄소감축은 탄소배출거래제 등을 통하여 인센티브로 평가되어 공산품생산을 통한 이익 못지않은 거대한 이익을 창출해 줄 수 있게 되었다. 이에는 캡 앤드 트레이드 방식, 베이스라인 앤드 크레딧 방식 등이 논의되지만, 세금혜택방식도 추가될 수 있다. 거대한 환경시장이 지속적이고 효과적으로 성장해가고 있다.이러한 유럽의 변화는 우리에게 다음과 같은 정책적 과제를 던져준다고 할 수 있다.첫 번째로 유럽의 CCS와 CCU 법정책의 변화 및 탄소배출거래제의 본격적 실시를 보면서, 우리도 이와 동일한 법정책적 지향점을 공통적으로 가지고 추진하여야 한다. 그러기 위해서는 CCUS에 대한 대중의 높아진 관심에 잘 대응할 수 있도록 과학적이고 객관적인 증거를 통하여 지속적으로 증명하고 설득해 나가야 한다.둘째, 탄소배출거래제에서 보듯이 환경과 시장을 연결하여 기후변화의 대응성과 적응성을 함께 도모하여야 한다. 이산화탄소를 직접적으로 감축하는 미시적인 것만 추진해서는 안 되고, 4차산업혁명과 결합하여 산업구조와 사회구조가 이산화탄소를 대체하거나 감축하는 방향으로 거시적인 변화가 일어나도록 해야 한다. 전자인 대응성과 후자인 적응성을 병행해서 조화롭게 추진해나가도록 하여야 한다.셋째, 국가 기관, 가스 인프라 회사 또는 탐사 및 생산 회사에 관계없이 CO2 저장 시설 운영자의 책임을 명확하게 할 것이 필요하다. CCUS와 관련된 금융과 보험 및 시장을 더 잘 개발하기 위해서는 이와 관계되는 자들의 책임도 역시 더욱 명확하게 해야 할 것이다.넷째, CCS 및 CCU 기술 및 프로젝트가 R & D, 데모 프로젝트 및 초기 인프라 구축을 포함하여 다양한 개발 단계에서 사용 가능한 공공 지원 체계에 적합함을 확신시켜 주도록 하여야 한다. CCS와 CCU가 지속 가능한 금융에 대한 실행 계획의 맥락에서 개발된 분류 체계에서 기후 변화 완화에 기여하는 경제 활동이라는 점을 인식가능하도록 하는 것이 중요하다.다섯째, 국제사회에서 국가들간에 협력이 필요하다. 유럽에서는 EU 2050 기후 비전(EU 2050 climate ambitions )을 달성하기 위해 회원국이 CCS 및 CCU에 대한 국가 및 NECP(유럽인을 위한 청정에너지 패키지 - Clean Energy for all Europeans Package-)의 구체적인 배치 전략 및 지원 정책을 하고 있음을 설명하고 협조를 구하고 있다.여섯째, 환경체인과 관계되는 모든 당사자들의 협력이 필요하다. 환경체인과 관계되는 나라와 기관 및 회사들 사이에 적절한 지질 및 인프라 정보 공유를 촉진하도록 장려하고, 적절한 저장 단지의 CO2 저장지도를 개발하도록 장려하여야 한다.일곱째, 규모의 경제가 달성 될 때까지, 특히 CCS 및 CCU 가치 사슬 구축 초기 단계에 공공 재정 지원이 필요하다.이러한 EU의 CCUS에 대한 변화를 인식하고 시사점들을 참고하여 국내의 입법들을 신속하고 구체적으로 추진해 나가야 할 것이다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1976-4383,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-06-22,KJD:ART002678126,,

We exposed HO to eggs of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) and investigated the neural disorder. In larvae exposed by HO at the concentration of 8.75 mg/L, the facial and lateral line nerves partially entered into the incorrect region and the bundle was defasciculated. Furthermore, in the HO-exposed larvae, Sema3A, a kind of axon guidance molecule, was broadly expressed in second pharyngeal arch, a target region of facial nerve. Taken together, we suggested the possibility that the abnormal expression of Sema3A affected by HO exposure causes disruption of facial nerve scaffolding. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

These formulations consider the static environmental loads over the platform (current and wind) through a static offset and the dynamic environmental loads due to wave through imposition of top riser displacement calculated from cross spectral response of sea spectrum and vessel's RAOs (Response Amplitude Operators).Nowadays due to shift of oil and gas exploitation to deeper waters more accurate methodologies, based on coupled analysis, have been introduced. The coupled analysis considers the interaction between the hydrodynamic behavior of the hull and the structural behavior of mooring lines and risers submitted to environmental loads. For deep waters the coupling effects of lines over platform motions are especially significant and a reduction of the amplification of platform motions if compared to the platform motions obtained from de-coupled analysis is observed.This paper presents a typical Steel Catenary Riser design, connected to a semi-submersible platform, where the motions applied to the top of riser are obtained from the traditional way (de-coupled) and from the coupled analysis. Numerical application is presented in order to assess the comparison of the two presented methods in terms of SCR analysis results and to confirm the reduction of platform motions due to coupling effects.The coupled model here studied is composed of approximately 80 lines connected to the platform which requires an excessive computational effort. In order to reduce the computational time some additional studies are performed considering the variation of line mesh discretization and time step size. The objective of this study is the adoption of an optimized model where the required accuracy is achieved and the computational time consuming is the minimum possible. The computational time consuming and platform motions are also presented.The conclusion of this work is that coupled analysis should be adopted by industry as usual practice of SCR design in deep waters, where more realistic and optimum results are presented, without an excessive computational effort.",,,,,27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering,"JUN 15-20, 2008JUN 15-20, 2008","ASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arct Engn Div","Estoril, PORTUGALEstoril, PORTUGAL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4820-3,,,,,,,,,"Det Norske Veritas, SURF & Pipeline, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Det Norske Veritas,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000263579600030,,

However, the current suite-as well as potential future suite-of thermoelectric generation technologies has a very wide range of water demand intensities, spanning two orders of magnitude. As such, the evolution of the generation mix is important for the future water demands of the sector. This study uses GCAM, an integrated assessment model, to analyze the global electric sector's water demands in three futures of climate change mitigation policy and two technology strategies. We find that despite five- to seven-fold expansion of the electric sector as a whole from 2005 to 2095, global electric sector water withdrawals remain relatively stable, due to the retirement of existing power plants with water-intensive once-through flow cooling systems. In the scenarios examined here, climate policies lead to the large-scale deployment of advanced, low-emissions technologies such as carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), concentrating solar power, and engineered geothermal systems. In particular, we find that the large-scale deployment of CCS technologies does not increase long-term water consumption from hydrocarbon-fueled power generation as compared with a no-policy scenario without CCS. Moreover, in sensitivity scenarios where low-emissions electricity technologies are required to use dry cooling systems, we find that the consequent additional costs and efficiency reductions do not limit the utility of these technologies in achieving cost-effective whole-system emissions mitigation.

In HPHT conditions, thermal expansion naturally occurs in structures such as pipelines, subsea systems, and topside facilities. To overcome HPHT-related problems of subsea pipelines, i.e., thermal expansion and global and local buckling, engineers must consider the amount of thermal expansion that may take place. This research will start reviewing the available methods for generating reliable pipe expansion designs. A pipeline expansion example will be studied with the assumption of free expansion with uniform temperature. This means that we assumed zero restraining forces at the pipe end, but soil friction along the pipe. The pipeline will be simulated using the finite element method (FEM) using ANSYS and compared with an in-house code written in MATLAB. The in-house code also contains the Topology Optimization of Binary Structures (TOBS) implementation that will be used to run a simplified optimization case of the subsea pipeline.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,19/18701-1,,,,,,,,"Escola Politécnica (EP).

The PNG LNG project is a joint venture with participation by ExxonMobil, Oil Search Limited (OSL), Kumul Petroleum, Santos, JX Nippon Oil and Gas Exploration and Mineral Resources Development Company, and began production in 2014. The highlands of PNG presents a challenging physical environment, with high rainfall, steep terrain, active tectonics and seismicity, and ongoing landsliding and erosion. The PNG LNG onshore gas and condensate pipelines confront these physical challenges by having to traverse approximately 150 km of steep volcanic, mudstone and Karstic highlands along the Papuan Fold and Thrust Belt, the modern leading edge of active mountain-building, plus an additional 150 km in Karstic lowlands. During design, construction and operations of the pipelines, ExxonMobil has addressed these challenges in partnership with the engineering, construction and specialist consulting communities.On February 25th, 2018 (UTC) a Magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck the PNG highlands. The event, along with its approximately 300 aftershocks, caused widespread community impact, landsliding and damage to over 1000s of km(2), and was centered directly under the highlands portion of the PNG LNG pipelines. The pipelines however, did not lose containment or pressure, and, following inspections and repairs to the PNG LNG gas conditioning plant, PNG LNG production was restored within seven weeks of the main shock.This technical paper and companion oral presentation discuss the key factors of this successful outcome, in particular the sustained condition of the gas and condensate pipelines. Contributing factors to the pipeline's success include route selection, pipe material specification, early commitment to field studies, careful assessment of geohazards, high awareness of off-ROW community impacts, micro-routing during construction, and active geohazard management during startup and operations. The paper demonstrates that, with respect for the host community, thoughtful engineering, careful construction and ongoing surveillance, pipelines can be safely and successfully designed, constructed and operated in remote and extreme geohazardous environments.",,,,,ASME13th International Pipeline Conference (IPC)ASME13th International Pipeline Conference (IPC),"SEP 23-30, 2020SEP 23-30, 2020","Amer Soc Mech Engineers; Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Pipeline Div; API; ROSEN; ENBRIDGE; TC Energy; Pipeline Res Council int; RCP; DNVAmer Soc Mech Engineers; Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Pipeline Div; API; ROSEN; ENBRIDGE; TC Energy; Pipeline Res Council int; RCP; DNV",ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1537-6788,,978-0-7918-8445-4,,,,,,,,,"ExxonMobil Upstream Integrated Solut, Spring, TX 77389 USAExxonMobil PNG Ltd, Port Moresby, Papua N GuineaExxonMobil Global Projects, Spring, TX USAExxonMobil Upstream Oil & Gas, Spring, TX USA",ExxonMobil PNG LtdExxonMobil Global Projects,,,2020-01-01,WOS:000850704700023,,
J,이경완,,,,,,,,,,Risks and Opportunities in Relation to Sustainable Energy Development in Siberia and the Russian Far East from the Viewpoint of Biblical Ecology,,,,,,,,The Journal of Eurasian Studies,유라시아연구,,,7,2,,,211,234,,,,,,,,,,,research-article,2010,2010,"This paper aims at establishing an alternativel risk management system from the biblical ecological viewpoint and identifying risks and opportunities in Siberia and the Russian Far East regarding sustainable energy development.A biblical ecological worldview is characterized by theocentric hierarchical relational identities and isomorphic correspondence between God, Humankind and nature(other kinds of creatures and elements). From that viewpoint, modern anthropocentric Christian discourses, based on optimism of human reason and morality, are prone to weakening awareness of the existence of transcendental beings like God and devils. As alternative discourses to them, ecocentric Christian discourses have come to the fore since the second half of the 20th century. These alternative perspectives are imbued with eclectical integration of biblical and mystic ideas of divinities, horizontal egalitarianism between humans and natural environment, belief in transfiguration of all creatures into divinities in the world, and identification of original biblical Christianity dating back the 1st and 2nd centuries with successive Christian cultures. Both anthropocentric and ecocentric Christian viewpoints share more optimistic and mystic conviction in humanities and comparatively weak awareness of destructive influence of evil powers and sins on the relationship between spiritual, human and natural dimensions.The concept of risk according to hierarchical biblical worldviews takes into consideration spiritual(transcendental and immanent), human and natural dimensions. The biblical conceptualization of risk management sheds light on the impact of human response to God's message on the whole relationships between these three dimensions.The Russian Orthodox-based religious culture holds theocentric and ecocentric elements simultaneously in the form of partial integration of Orthodoxy with Slavic pre-Christian polytheism and/or Siberian Shaman tradition. In addition, mysticism, monasticism and negative theology, messianism, etc. will influence the Russian mentality in the direction of preventing it from inducing any viable risk management against uncertainties in the world. Besides, in the modern period, Russian national identity has wavered between Orthodox-based messianic self-awareness and west-centric Orientalism. On the other hand, there are universal and theocentric elements in Russian religious culture, on the basis of which the Russian society could establish a new relational identity with God, the west and other nations and natural environment, which would lead to improving the Russian society' risk management capability.When it comes to risk factors and opportunities in environment and energy in Siberia and the Russian Far East according to the biblical concepts of risks and risk management, in respect to climate change and environment the Russian eastern part is regarded as very vulnerable to those risk factors. Scientific estimation of the influence of climate change on meteorologic conditions, human health, agriculture, and social infra in the eastern part shows its vulnerability to uncertainties in natural realm. On the contrary, the increase of temperature by 1-2℃may create new socio-economical opportunities including expansion of arable land and residential areas, increase in exploitable energy resources, and boost of tourism. However, the long-term risk factors would threaten the promising short-term opportunities, which could be realized under the prerequisites of comprehensive and consistent approaches. However, ideological and institutional conflicts between the west and Russia over the crucial climate change and environmental issues lower the institutional and material potentials of effective risk management.In energy sector, oil and gas exploitation and transport projects in permafrost zones and Arctic continental shelves are estimated very vulnerable to climate change and environmental problems. On the contrary, global warming may contribute to decrease in energy consumption, increase in renewable energy and energy efficiency. To realize them is required the long-term comprehensive and viable risk management system.In social dimension, there has passed down the negative legacy of Soviet plan economy, which was detrimental to natural and human environments adjacent to industrial complexes and overdeveloped urban places. The ignorance of the Soviet regime to environments is attributed to its obsession with competitive desire against western capitalist states. On the other hand, many residents at some local communities has been aware of significance of environmental conservation and sustainable development and organized grass-roots environmental NGOs. Nevertheless, there are the ideological conflicts between anthropocentric economic models and alternative long-term sustainable models, which would prohibit the Russian society from following the path of sustainable energy development.In the future, this research might be followed by successive studies in the direction of the biblical mapping of risk factors, risk management and opportunities in Siberia and the Russian Far East, the establishment of biblical economic models, the planning of sustainable development projects, focusing on specific local communities, and the establishment of Korea-Russia bilateral or multilateral energy cooperation regime for sustainable energy development in Siberia and the Russian Far East.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1738-3382,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2010-01-01,KJD:ART001456194,,

In case of accident, oil flow can be restored quickly and represents a limited loss, unlike gas that is normally linked to contracted quantities. Any gas interruption affects downstream and consumer supply, whereas any incident on a crude or product line carries a high environmental risk and associated remedial costs.Pipelines are more vulnerable than what assessed and perceived at present. This is confirmed by the extremely high number of IT attacks on pipeline operating systems, but also by recent accidents caused by assaults in remote areas. Threats mostly affect operational systems but in other cases they imply physical and mechanical damage to the pipeline. Most hydrocarbon transport infrastructures are not equipped with physical perimeter security because threats are not apparent and there are opex and construction capex limitations with respect to available technology. Automated perimeter surveillance, when in place, is carried out by satellite with limitations of resolution and logistics, besides involving high costs for image processing and interpretation.This paper introduces a new, reliable, fully automated and cost effective pipeline passive surveillance system that, when installed and interfaced with the pipeline operational system, can virtually eliminate the risk of physical perimeter intrusions. Intrusion. detection is achieved by means of a large number of sensors deployed on or below the ground surface. The transmitted sensors signals are analyzed in pseudo real time by means of neural nets and pattern recognition algorithms. Adaptable beam forming transforms are utilized in real time processing and analysis to output type of intrusion, position, azimuth and approaching speed with reference to the infrastructure. The results can be automatically correlated to a signature database for automated alarm triggering decision and, or displayed on monitor screens. In case of noisy background, pattern recognition techniques are also employed to isolate the signal. The system works in hibernation mode until it detects a meaningful signal. The system can be ported also to offshore and sub sea application and it is virtually effective on any type of terrain.Other advantages of this method are that surveillance is carried out without high profile protections such as barbed wire and fences, the system is entirely unmanned, it is not visible from the air or from land, it is instrumentally undetectable and it draws electric power from photovoltaic solar panels.",,,,,Progress in Electromagnetics Research Symposium 2007Progress in Electromagnetics Research Symposium 2007,"AUG 27-30, 2007AUG 27-30, 2007","Czech Tech Univ Prague; IEEE, Czechoslovakia Sect; IEEE, EMBS Chap Czechoslovakia Sect; Zhejiang Univ, Electromagnet Acad; MIT Ctr Electromagnet Theory & Applicat; Res Lab Elect; Electromagnet AcadCzech Tech Univ Prague; IEEE, Czechoslovakia Sect; IEEE, EMBS Chap Czechoslovakia Sect; Zhejiang Univ, Electromagnet Acad; MIT Ctr Electromagnet Theory & Applicat; Res Lab Elect; Electromagnet Acad","Prague, CZECH REPUBLICPrague, CZECH REPUBLIC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-934142-02-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000250668500026,,

The sequence of these docks provided a unique opportunity to obtain a high-resolution stratigraphy. The new approach is based on stratigraphic interpretation of deformation patterns created by the posts in soft sediments, combined with dendrochronological dating of the posts. Dendrochronology offers the potential to date the posts to within one calendar year of felling, a level of precision and accuracy rare in sedimentological analysis. The posts, most of them Quercus, were rammed during six different time periods. The first period is associated with posts cut in 528 AD. The second and third periods are dated by posts cut in 583 and 594 AD, respectively. The fourth-period dates within 8-10 years of 639 AD.

These contestatory spaces in neoliberalised economies are frequently depoliticised through a variety of processes, strategies, practices, and actors. Recently this has been framed as the post-political - whereby dissent is legitimised as democratic only when it does not challenge the status quo of business-as-usual. Most of the analysis and commentary on the post-political has focused on policy or democratic decision-making processes and conflict at relatively broad scales, rather than nuanced empirical case studies. In this paper we draw on an empirical case study to explore how processes of delegitimisation affect climate justice activists in emotional and personal ways. We argue that while the political subjectivities of climate justice activists are fragile achievements, a key aspect that sustains them is an ethic of care for humans and non-humans, both near and more distant, who are affected by climate change. Fostering this ethic of care is one key way for climate activists to continue enacting responsibility for climate justice in a way that contests depoliticising and delegitimisation processes.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,0,18,,,0020-2754,1475-5661,,,,,,,,,,"Te Whare Wananga O Otago Univ Otago, Te Iho Whenua Sch Geog, Otepoti Dunedin, New ZealandTe Herenga Waka Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington, New ZealandManaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Wellington, New Zealand",Te Whare Wananga O Otago Univ OtagoTe Herenga Waka Victoria Univ Wellington,,,2020-04-27,WOS:000526025000001,,

However, periodic tidal flooding reduces spectral reflectance, especially in the near and short-wave infrared wavelengths. Consequently, marsh vegetation time-series products that lack tidal filtering, such as those provided by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), may not reflect true vegetation trends. We created a new Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII) for processing daily 500-m MODIS surface reflectance data and calibrated it with a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh pixel on Sapelo Island, GA. Ground-truth data for TMII was extracted from a PhenoCam, which collected high frequency digital photography of the TMII calibration pixel. To identify the best wavelengths to include in the TMII, we compared goodness of fit metrics from generalized linear models (GLMs). Predictors for these GLMs included suites of normalized difference indices from the literature as well as other band combinations. We also explored including a phonology parameter that could scale TMII relative to vegetation development. Ultimately, TMII was based on the normalized difference of green and shortwave infrared reflectance in combination with a phenology parameter composed of the moving average of the normalized difference of near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance. This final index allowed a single optimized decision boundary to identify flooding across the annual growth cycle. When compared to ground-truth data from the PhenoCam, the TMII classified flooded conditions with 67-82% and dry conditions with 75-81% accuracy, respectively, across training, testing and validation datasets. We applied TMII to new S. alterniflora marsh MODIS pixels on Sapelo Island, GA as well as on Plum Island, MA. For these new pixels, TMII classified marsh flooding with 77-80% overall accuracy. We also demonstrated how users can apply TMII filtering in a MODIS workflow to create vegetation time-series composites within S. alterniflora, Spardrza patens and Juncus roemerianus marshes. We showed how a new user can validate and optimize TMII in their application, either by comparing it to inundation data or by validating the filtered vegetation time series against field data. We also compared TMII-filtered composites to the existing MODIS MOD13 16-d Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product. TMII-filtered composites generated less noisy time -series that fit field data better than MOD13. TMII filtering was most important on Sapelo Island, where the tide range was high and vegetation was sparse. Results were less dramatic when TMII was applied to different marsh species within the Gulf Coast sites with lower tidal ranges, but TMII-filtering still improved vegetation time series. Thus, preprocessing MODIS imagery with the TMII effectively identified most inundated pixels. The TMII represents a step forward for wetland remote sensing that will be useful for improved estimation of phonology, biomass and carbon storage in coastal marshes.",,,,,,,,,46,1,0,0,23,0,52,,,0034-4257,1879-0704,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USAUniv Georgia, Dept Geog, Ctr Geospatial Res, Athens, GA 30602 USA",,,,2017-12-06,WOS:000412866400004,,

The oil spill risk assessment is carried out by using two factors: 1) The impact probability of the oil spill, and 2) the first impact time of the oil that has been spilt. The risk assessment is conducted for environmentally sensitive areas, such as the coastline and aquaculture farms in the Garorim Bay area. Finally, Garorim Bay is divided into six subareas, and the risks of each subarea are compared with one another to identify the subarea that is most vulnerable to an oil spill accident. These results represent an objective and comprehensive oil spill risk level for a specific region. The prediction of the oil spill spread is based on real-time sea conditions and can be improved by integrating our results, especially when sea conditions are rapidly changing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A subsequent laboratory study evaluated the effect of oil deposit geometry on localized gradients of electron acceptors and microbial community composition, factors that are critical to accurately estimating biodegradation rates. One-dimensional top flow sand columns with 12-h simulated tidal cycles compared two contrasting geometries (isolated tar balls versus horizontal sheets) relative to an oil-free control. Significant differences in the effluent dissolved oxygen and sulfate concentrations were noted among the columns, indicating presence of anaerobic zones in the oiled columns, particularly in the sheet condition. Furthermore, quantification of genetic markers of terminal electron acceptor and catabolic processes via quantitative polymerase chain reaction of dsrA (sulfate reduction), mcrA (methanogenesis), and cat23 (oxygenation of aromatics) genes in column cores suggested more extensive anaerobic conditions induced by the sheet relative to the ball geometry. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis similarly revealed that distinct gradients of bacterial communities established in response to the different geometries. Thus, petroleum deposit geometry impacts local dominant electron acceptor conditions and may be a key factor for advancing attenuation models and prioritizing cleanup.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,,,,,,,"Virginia Tech, Via Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",,,,2012-07-04,WOS:000304783000022,22574781,
