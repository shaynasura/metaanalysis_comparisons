However, the increasing pressures upon the marine realm threaten marine ecosystems, especially seabed biotopes, and thus a well-planned approach of managing use of marine space is essential to achieve sustainability. The relative value of seabed biotopes, evaluated on the basis of goods and services, is an important starting point for the spatial management of marine areas. Herein, 56 types of European seabed biotopes and their related goods, services, sensitivity issues, and conservation status were compiled, the latter referring to management and protection tools which currently apply for these biotopes at European or international level. Fishing activities, especially by benthic trawls, and marine pollution are the main threats to European seabed biotopes. Increased seawater turbidity, dredged sediment disposal, coastal constructions, biological invasions, mining, extraction of raw materials, shipping-related activities, tourism, hydrocarbon exploration, and even some practices of scientific research, also exert substantial pressure. Although some first steps have been taken to protect the European sea beds through international agreements and European and national legislation, a finer scale of classification and assessment of marine biotopes is considered crucial in shaping sound priorities and management guidelines towards the effective conservation and sustainability of European marine resources.",,,,,,,,,117,0,0,0,79,0,118,,,1108-393X,,,,,,,,,,,"HCMR, Anavyssos 19013, GreeceEuropean Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Ispra, ItalyAZTI Tecnalia Marine Res Div, Pasaia 20110, SpainGhent Univ UGent, Dept Biol, B-9000 Ghent, BelgiumEuropean Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, IPSC Maritime Affairs Unit, I-21027 Ispra, VA, ItalyMRRA, Capture Fisheries Sect, Ft San Lucjan 1283, Marsaxlokk Bbg, MaltaUOS Messina, CNR, IAMC, I-98122 Messina, ItalyCNR, IAMC, I-91014 Castellammare Del Golfo, TP, ItalyBulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Varna 9000, Bulgaria",MRRA,,,2012-06-01,WOS:000306303500006,,,,,

A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was used to conduct video transects on the wrecks and through the adjacent debris fields. Shipwrecks were used as surrogates for deep-sea drilling platforms to determine if structures in deep waters serve as artificial reefs. We focused on two genera and three species of decapod crustaceans: Munidopsis spp., Munida spp., Eumunida picta S. I. Smith, 1883, Rochinia crassa Milne-Edwards, 1879, and Chaceon quinquedens (S. I. Smith, 1879). Differences in abundance m(-2) were compared among three locations (on, near, and away from [> 300 m] the wreck) to determine if the presence of the wrecks affected crab distributions. The two most abundant crab species were observed only at four of the six shipwrecks, and two species were observed at a single site. All crabs, except R. crassal had no spatial correlation to proximity of the wreck; however, crab abundance varied significantly on different substrates. Crab abundance was significantly correlated with depth; some species were stenobathyal while others were eurybathyal, but all species were found within their previously reported depth ranges.

One-hundred-thirty-eight marine species in 15 classes or functional groups are NIS in Brazil. Brazilian states with greater maritime commerce (greater market share) had more marine NIS. From the period between the 1950s to 2010, the number of NIS at least doubled each decade. We identified a significant mismatch (underestimation) between the previous list and this study, which seemed to be due to improved scientific knowledge and an often considerable lag between first record (detection), identification and communication of new marine NIS.

JOHN'S,,OCEANS-IEEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Proceedings Paper,2014,2014,"Assessment of the potential impact of underwater acoustic noise from both construction and operation of almost all human marine activities is now commonplace within many international regulatory frameworks. More recent industries like offshore renewables (wind, wave and tidal) have experienced an increasing requirement to understand how their energy conversion devices interact with existing acoustic environments and what their potential for impacts might be. Assessing the potential for impact, however, results in a number of measurement challenges, for example, many of these devices represent highly complex, multi-modal, distributed sources which can be anything from arrays of many small (few meters) devices to larger systems with dimensions of hundreds of meters. The systems can also vary in nature from a floating device, for example a wave energy surface attenuator, or can be distributed throughout the water column, as can be the case for both wave and tidal systems, or wind turbine. In the case of an offshore wind turbine for example, the device is coupled to the seabed, and extends throughout the water column and in to the air. This distribution and configuration can make the measured acoustic characteristics strongly dependent on the environment, with the potential for propagation through the seabed, water and air, with complex interactions, particularly between the seabed and waterborne components of the sound.The environments themselves are also often acoustically complicated. For example, many of the devices are being developed in relatively shallow water where there is often strong bathymetric variation, and other natural and manmade noise sources. The devices themselves often also exhibit time variant characteristics. They can become more energetic with tidal speed, wave height wind speed increase, for example. Furthermore, these properties also alter the 'natural' acoustic environment or baseline condition.The relationship between device noise and background or ambient noise is also likely to be fundamental to the effect these devices have on marine species, for example, by causing a change in behaviour or creating a masking effect. It may effect the detection capability of an animal, which may be important for collision avoidance. This paper discusses analysis of some of these challenges in the context of a number of emerging technology types. In particular, the paper considers the dynamically varying nature of the ratio of the noise radiated from the device to the background noise. Data is presented of the operational noise levels against the background noise levels, under different seastates for a full-scale attenuator wave energy system.",,,,,Oceans ConferenceOceans Conference,"SEP 14-19, 2014SEP 14-19, 2014",,"St Johns, CANADASt Johns, CANADA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4799-4918-2,,,,,,,,,"Univ Loughborough, Loughborough, Leics, EnglandNatl Phys Lab, Acoust Grp, Teddington TW11 0LW, Middx, England",,,,2014-01-01,WOS:000369848800180,,,,,

MREDs are part of an ongoing large-scale modification of coastal waters that also includes activities such as commercial fishing, shipping, aggregate extraction, aquaculture, dredging, spoil-dumping and oil and gas exploitation. It is increasingly accepted that developments, of any kind, should only proceed if they are ecologically sustainable and will not reduce current or future delivery of ecosystem services. The benthos underpins crucial marine ecosystem services yet, in relation to MREDs, is currently poorly monitored: current monitoring programmes are extensive and costly yet provide little useful data in relation to ecosystem-scale-related changes, a situation called 'data-rich, information-poor' (DRIP). MRED -benthic interactions may cause changes that are of a sufficient scale to change ecosystem services provision, particularly in terms of fisheries and biodiversity and, via trophic linkages, change the distribution of fish, birds and mammals. The production of DRIPy data should be eliminated and the resources used instead to address relevant questions that are logically bounded in time and space. Efforts should target identifying metrics of change that can be linked to ecosystem function or service provision, particularly where those metrics show strongly non-linear effects in relation to the stressor. Future monitoring should also be designed to contribute towards predictive ecosystem models and be sufficiently robust and understandable to facilitate transparent, auditable and timely decision-making.",,,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,24,0,51,,,1364-0321,,,,,,,,,,,"SAMS, Scottish Marine Inst, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, ScotlandCranfield Univ, Ctr Offshore Renewable Energy & Engn, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Bldg 52, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, EnglandDeltares, Delft, NetherlandsPlymouth Univ, Marine Inst, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandNormandie Univ, UNICAEN, UMR UCN M2C, UR,CNRS 6143, 24 Rue Tilleuls, F-14000 Caen 5, FranceMarine Inst, Galway, IrelandUniv Gdansk, Inst Oceanog, Al Marsz Pilsudskiego 46, Gdynia, PolandUniv Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, EstoniaRoyal Belgian Inst Nat Sci RBINS, Operat Directorate Nat Environm Marine Ecol & Man, 3e 23e Linieregimentspl, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium",SAMS,,,2017-06-09,WOS:000401492900061,,,,,

Significant variability in the emission composition is observed between individual sites, with typical ethane/methane ratios around 5.3% and C-13 and D methane isotopic compositions around -40 and -240%c, respectively. Offshore plumes were spatially narrower than expectations of the plume width based on terrestrial atmospheric stability classes; a modified Gaussian dispersion methodology using empirically measured horizontal plume widths was used to estimate the emission rates. A total of 103 sites were studied, including shallow and deepwater offshore platforms and drillships. Methane emission rates range from 0 to 190 kg/h with 95% confidence limits estimated at a factor of 10.

The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is known to be vulnerable to collision with wind turbines and federal wind energy guidelines include an eagle risk assessment for new projects. To address the need for risk assessment, in this study, we 1) identified areas of northeastern North America utilized by migrating bald eagles, and 2) compared these with high wind-potential areas to identify potential risk of bald eagle collision with wind turbines. We captured and marked 17 resident and migrant bald eagles in the northern Chesapeake Bay between August 2007 and May 2009. We produced utilization distribution (UD) surfaces for 132 individual migration tracks using a dynamic Brownian bridge movement model and combined these to create a population wide UD surface with a 1 km cell size. We found eagle migration movements were concentrated within two main corridors along the Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic Coast. Of the 3,123 wind turbines >= 100 m in height in the study area, 38% were located in UD 20, and 31% in UD 40. In the United States portion of the study area, commercially viable wind power classes overlapped with only 2% of the UD category 20 (i.e., the areas of highest use by migrating eagles) and 4% of UD category 40. This is encouraging because it suggests that wind energy development can still occur in the study area at sites that are most viable from a wind power perspective and are unlikely to cause significant mortality of migrating eagles. In siting new turbines, wind energy developers should avoid the high-use migration corridors (UD categories 20 & 40) and focus new wind energy projects on lower-risk areas (UD categories 60-100).",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,11,0,14,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Coll William & Mary, Ctr Conservat Biol, Williamsburg, VA USAVirginia Commonwealth Univ, Williamsburg, VA USAEDM Int Inc, 4001 Automat Way, Ft Collins, CO USAYale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT USA",EDM Int Inc,,,2016-06-23,WOS:000378389200050,27336482,,,,

Newly developed cryogenic sediment sampling techniques combined with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy (LTSEM) protocols developed for the analysis of biological materials now permits the sampling of fully hydrated bottom sediments while preserving the structural integrity of the sampled material. This enables the direct observation of the sediment fabric as it exists at the seabed and the examination of delicate biological structures that are normally obliterated or distorted by the removal of water required for standard SEM preparation. This paper demonstrates the value of LTSEM and shows variation in microfabric structure between a station located on a spoil heap below an oil rig and a more remote (400 m distant) station. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) was also conducted on the frozen samples and provided support for the qualitative differences found between the two sites. The results suggest that an organic film was more pervasive on the drill spoil heap and that biological activity in the form of foraminifera was much more extensive on the remote site. Insufficient data has yet been collected to allow statistical analysis of the results, but the paper provides the first microfabric analyses of submerged spoil sediments using LTSEM and confirms the potential of this technique in terms of environmental assessment and analysis of the nature of the sediment fabric of oily, drill spoil heaps from a location in the North Sea.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,,,,,,,"Univ St Andrews, Gatty Marine Lab, Sch Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Sediment Ecol Res Grp, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland",,,,1999-06-15,WOS:000080965800005,,,,,

This holds especially true for routing decisions taken when confronted with large bodies of water. Once taken, these decisions can be hardly altered or revised. In this paper, we analysed stopover and routing decisions taken by three species of thrushes, blackbirds, redwings and song thrushes, at the German North Sea coast.Methods: Birds were equipped with radio-telemetry tags at stopover sites along the coast during autumn migration and subsequently tracked by an automated receiver network covering the coastline and islands of the German Bight.Results: The thrushes resumed migration in nights with a favourable northward wind component and clear skies. About 40% of the tagged individuals have taken an offshore instead of an alongshore oriented flight route. Routing decisions were influenced by the strength of the eastward wind component with offshore oriented flights taking place primarily under weak winds or winds blowing towards the west. Thrushes that took an offshore oriented route stopped over at the coast longer than those flying alongshore. Interestingly, offshore as well as alongshore oriented flights co-occurred within single nights and under comparable weather conditions.Conclusions: Migratory flight and routing decisions of thrushes at the German North Sea coast are highly dependent on weather, in particular wind. Still, we found evidence that weather may not be the sole reason for individual routes taken. Physical condition, morphology or animal personality lend themselves as possible additional factors of influence. Enabling a more detailed understanding of thrush migration over and along the German North Sea, our data help to better judge risks that migratory birds are facing when en route conditions are altered, for example by artificial obstacles such as offshore wind turbines.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,15,0,18,,,2051-3933,,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Avian Res, Vogelwarte 21, D-26386 Wilhelmshaven, Germany",Inst Avian Res,,,2019-10-31,WOS:000494721100001,31695918,,,,

North Sea fisheries remain important to the surrounding countries despite declining fish stocks over the past decades. The main reason for declining fish stocks is nearly certainly overfishing, but other environmental pressures also affect fish populations, such as eutrophication, climate change, and exposure to metals and organic pollutants, including polyaromatic hydrocat bons (PAHs), alkylphenols, and organochlorine compounds. There are three main sources of organic pollutants in the North Sea: atmospheric, land-based sources, and inputs from offshore gas and oil installations. All three sources contribute to elevated concentrations of organic pollutants in the North Sea compared to the Norwegian Sea. There is evidence that chlorinated organic contaminants were present in sufficiently high concentrations in the southern North Sea two decades ago, to alter embryonal development in fish. The results from extensive, long-term monitoring programs show that some diseases decreased whereas other increased in the southern North Sea and that, among other factors, contaminants may play a role in the temporal changes recorded in disease prevalence.

Highest event rate recorded was 716/hour on the night of 18 May and was the larger and second of two prominent peaks evident during the season. Detectability of events was a function of proximity to radar. Event rate was adjusted for radar detectability and defined as activity rate. Mean activity rate at night was over 2.5 times that of daylight. Daylight activity rates/100-m segment of transect were inversely correlated with topographical relief. Median height of night events (278 m) was 1.5 times higher than daylight events (P0.001).

To assess the impact of wind farms before, during and after their construction, the standard investigation concept of the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) currently recommends ship- and aircraft-based bird surveys. Observation-based aerial surveys, however, have methodological disadvantages: Low flight elevation (78 m), necessary for species recognition, and high flight speed in combination with large numbers of birds allow only rough population estimates. In addition, aircrafts flying at this elevation disturb resting birds, further obstructing their quantification. In this pilot study, we compared visually estimated seabird numbers collected during an aerial transect survey with numbers derived from digital aerial photographs of the same transects. The photographic survey was carried out shortly before the visual survey at a height of 200 m above sea level using a high-resolution digital camera (39 Mega pixels). 415 vertical photos corrected for geometry and scale were taken at regular intervals along defined transects. The results of this study suggest that the observational survey significantly underestimated the number of sea ducks. The difference between visual and photographic methods varied considerably among species: 85% (Common Eider, Somateria mollissima), 41% (Long-tailed Duck, Clangula hyemalis) and only 2% (Common Scoter, Melanitta nigra) of the photographically documented individuals were observed.

The results show that the Sandwich structure is of great importance for shale gas accumulation. Therein to, the Sandwich structure is a kind of special reservoir-cap rock assemblage which consist of limestone or dolomite on the top, mudstone or shale layer in the middle and limestone or dolomite at the bottom. In consideration of the Mesozoic-Paleozoic in the Lower Yangtze, and Laoshan Uplift with weak Paleozoic deformation and thrust fault sealing on both flanks of the Laoshan Uplift, a conclusion can be drawn that the preservation conditions of shale gas probably developed Sandwich structures in the Lower Cambrian and Permian, which are key layers for the breakthrough of shale gas in the South Yellow Sea. Moreover, the preferred targets for shale gas drilling probably locate at both flanks of the Laoshan Uplift.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Acoustic Identication of Marine Cetaceans using Deep Learning Techniques,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2017,2017,"Modelling cetacean (dolphins, whales and porpoises) dynamics and behaviour is paramount to effective population management and conservation. Robust data is required for the design and implementation of conservation strategies and to assess risk presented by anthropogenic (man-made) activity such as offshore wind turbines and fishing. Moreover, cetaceans make prime candidates for modelling ecosystem change under the ecosystem sentinel concept as they reflect the current state of the ecosystem and respond to change across different spatial and temporal scales. As global climate changes and urbanisation of coastal areas intensies, it is imperative to develop methodologies for quick and effective assessment of the biological and ecological impact of rising sea temperatures, pollution and habitat degradation. This can be achieved through modelling the population, behaviour and health of large marine species such as dolphins.Methodologies of cetacean research include passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). Deployed PAM is less expensive and labour intensive compared to other marine mammal methodologies and can record data over long temporal scales. For dolphins, this is limited to the monitoring of echolocation clicks and some species identification using the whistles they produce, unable to identify individuals within a species and difference between certain species (such as bottlenose and white-beaked dolphins). The research will addresses these limitations by applying the methodologies and techniques of deep learning to the field of marine biology, mainly focusing on image analysis techniques. Methodologies will be designed to quickly identify individuals, analyse behaviour and incorporate remote sensing techniques. From these identifications estimations of group size will also be made. A statistical framework will be developed, which can be incorporated into PAM systems, to monitor species and individual occurrence over long spatial scales.Data collection will focus on a population of white-beaked dolphins (WBD) off the coast of North-East England. Recent research has identified sites where the species is regularly sighted and has shown seasonal and multi-year residency. A health assessment identified high incidence of skin disease and trauma suggesting conservation of this population should be high priority. Moreover, there has been recent evidence of this species producing unique whistles, however more evidence is needed, which this research will provide.The research will develop novel acoustic analysis algorithms which can be deployed on small low-cost Linux based computers, to be taken into the field to perform analyses in real time. These algorithms will be developed to work on both visualised and raw acoustic data collected from WBD, consisting primarily of whistles. The process for initial data collection has already begun using hydrophones to record dolphin vocalisations during expeditions off the coast of the North-East England. Initial visualisation of acoustic recordings have also begun, but experimentation with depth and distance from vessel placement of hydrophones are needed. The research will develop a novel method and statistical framework using deep learning models for acoustic analysis. This objective will be evaluated by testing the trained algorithm at successfully identifying group size or individuals from acoustic recordings.Another aim of the research is to assess the effect of anthropogenic activity on cetaceans, mainly wind turbines and boats. There is a large collection of wind turbines off the coast of Blyth where the collection of WBD and other cetaceans habitat. There has been no studies of how the noise pollution from these turbines affect the population but recent research has shown trauma to the white-beaked dolphins suggesting this could be a possible cause.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1948773,,,,,,,,Newcastle University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15510821,,,,,

The current study used well-established biomarkers for PAH exposure and oxidative stress, measuring EROD activity, the acute antioxidant response as well as oxidation of proteins detected as protein carbonyl levels. Results show the strongest biomarker results in an area with extensive oil drilling, where dab displayed high levels of EROD activities. This was also seen in dab captured in the Baltic Sea where elevated levels of oxidized glutathione and a trend towards higher EROD activity were observed. The obtained results did, however, not indicate a coherent biomarker response. The study was conducted off shore where many areas have presumably low levels of pollutants, and we could detect minor effects using the biomarker approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As a consequence, each stability class considered still covers a wide range of conditions. In this paper, wind turbine fatigue loads are studied as a function of atmospheric stability without a classification system, and instead, atmospheric conditions are described by a continuous joint probability distribution of wind speed and stability. Simulated fatigue loads based upon this joint probability distribution have been compared with two distinct different cases, one in which seven stability classes are adopted and one neglecting atmospheric stability by following International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards. It is found that for the offshore site considered in this study, fatigue loads of the blade root, rotor and tower loads significantly increase if one follows the IEC standards (by up to 28% for the tower loads) and decrease if one considers several stability classes (by up to 13% for the tower loads). The substantial decrease found for the specific stability classes can be limited by considering one stability class that coincides with the mean stability of a given hub height wind speed. The difference in simulated fatigue loads by adopting distinct stability classes is primarily caused by neglecting strong unstable conditions for which relatively high fatigue loads occur. Combined, it is found that one has to carefully consider all stability conditions in wind turbine fatigue load simulations.

Since bongo nets were more effective than neuston nets at capturing red snapper larvae only catches from bongo nets were used to estimate annual occurrence and abundance, i.e. the SEAMAP larval red snapper index. The summer survey was conducted during the peak of red snapper spawning in June and July, but limited and inconsistent coverage during this survey did not permit development of a reliable Gulfwide (U.S. continental shelf) index of larval abundance. In contrast, the fall survey conducted near the end of the spawning season in September yielded a 16 year time series over which to examine trends in red snapper abundance throughout the GOM. Although occurrence and abundance of red snapper larvae were lower during September than in June and July, estimates from both summer and fall surveys showed the same inter-annual patterns and Were highly correlated. Larvae were eight times more abundant and occurred in five times as many samples in the western than in the eastern GOM. Separate standardized indices of relative abundance were generated for the western and eastern GOM. The standardization procedure accounted for the effects of year, time of day, depth and subregion in the western GOM, but only for subregion in the eastern GOM. Larval indices of red snapper abundance suggest an increased spawning stock in both the western and eastern GOM after 1995.",,,,,Symposium on Fisheries Ecology of Gulf of Mexico Red SnapperSymposium on Fisheries Ecology of Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper,"FEB 10-12, 2006FEB 10-12, 2006","Sea Grant Louisiana; NOAA; Univ West Florida; Univ S Alabama; Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries InstSea Grant Louisiana; NOAA; Univ West Florida; Univ S Alabama; Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries Inst","San Antonio, TXSan Antonio, TX",12,0,0,0,12,0,17,,,0892-2284,,978-1-888569-97-1,,,,,,,,,"Mississippi Labs, SE Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Mississippi State, MS 39567 USA",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000253386500019,,,,,

Seven years of data were used to investigate the influence of Construction-Related Activity (CRA) on the occurrence of dolphins in the bay where the pipeline made landfall. CRA varied substantially over the seven years and included dredging, pipe-laying, and rock armouring as well as seismic surveys. While individual activities could not be examined in isolation, there was no evidence of aggregated CRA or season influencing occurrence, despite a greater number of CRA days during summer months. There was weak support for the influence of year, but lower occurrence rates did not correspond to years with more CRA days, or vice versa. The uncorrected (marked animals, only) and corrected (accounting for unmarked individuals) annual abundance estimates with the lowest coefficient of variation were 67 (95% CI = 62-84; CV = 0.08) and 140 (95% CI = 106-174; CV = 0.12) in 2010, which was comparable to estimates from a neighbouring region on the west coast of Ireland. Of the well-marked individuals approximately 50% were re-sighted in two or more years and re-sightings within years were as high as 70%. Overall, there was little evidence to suggest that the extended period of CRA resulted in a short- or long-term reduction in the occurrence of dolphins within the bay. However, given the relatively coarse spatial and temporal scale of the CRA data it was not possible to assess fine-scale movements, such as redistribution within the bay in response to CRA within the immediate area. To better inform management and mitigation practices, greater emphasis should be placed on designing robust monitoring programmes that focus beyond fine-scale displacement as the sole indicator of an impact.

The model is suitable for application to the biomass, wind, solar and ocean-derived energy industries. It basically assumes that, given a set of prices and a specific technology, the marginal efficiency of capital invested in these industries only depends on the productivity of the project's site and on its energy transport distance. As suggested by traditional investment theory, the model supposes that only those projects offering marginal efficiencies of capital above the current available rate of interest would be implemented, thus demarcating a region in the productivity-energy transport distance space where all the economically viable projects should lie. By relating this region to the geographic space available for development, total potential investment can be deduced. By using cash flows defined in variable energy transport distance and mean wind speed, a case study for the Chilean wind energy industry is presented. The use of the model to analyse the effect of alternative support schemes for wind energy in Chile is briefly demonstrated. It is concluded that for increasing the area economically available for the development of new wind farms, a research and development support scheme aimed at reducing investment cost of wind turbines by 25% is equivalent to a 20% price subsidy on energy.

Reef materials that retain developed fouling communities or ballast. such as decommissioned petroleum platforms, inactive or derelict ships, and bridge rubble are potential NIS vectors. Habitat provided by reefs placed in areas devoid of natural hard bottom or structure may be colonized by NIS propagules dispersed from natural or anthropogenic sources. A network of reef structures may also create NIS corridors for linking previously unconnected areas. Due to its level of offshore habitat alteration, changing environmental conditions, volume of shipping and boating traffic, and subtropical location, the Gulf Of Mexico may be particularly vulnerable to NIS introductions and has a number of documented NIS. Non-indigenous or invasive species concerns have delayed and increased costs for some recent reef construction projects. The linkages between NIS and constructed reefs are reviewed, and approaches for anticipating, assessing, and controlling introductions are recommended. Using basic information about NIS risks, reef planners can begin to evaluate unintended consequences and incorporate risk management measures to reduce future introductions. Prevention is the most effective risk reduction approach because controlling marine NIS after introduction is expensive and offers limited probability for success. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The Gulf is a naturally stressed environment due to extremes of salinity and temperature and anthropogenically affected by rapid urbanization, maritime transport, desalination plants, and oil platforms. Historical records and distributional studies have commonly underestimated the benthic foraminiferal diversity in the Gulf. Thirty-two samples collected from depths between 20 and 45m were analyzed for total (unstained) foraminiferal assemblages. A total of 221 benthic foraminiferal species and subspecies belonging to 69 genera, 34 families, and 6 orders were recognized. The assemblages are dominated by hyaline taxa (49%) and porcelaneous foraminifera (36%), while agglutinated foraminifera represent only a minor part (15%). The ten most abundant species are Nonion sp. 1 (5.8%), Quinqueloculina sp. 1 (4.7%), Asterorotalia dentata (4.2%), Bolivina cf. B. persiensis (3.9%), Asterorotalia sp. 3 (3.5%), Rotalinoides gaimardi (3.4%), Ammonia sp. 1 (3.3%), Quinqueloculina sp. 8 (3.3%), Bolivina cf. B. striatula (3.0%), and Nonion sp. 2 (2.8%). We speculate that increase of finer sediments (mud), availability of nutrients, and the presence of oxygen are factors controlling the diversity and distribution of benthic foraminifera. The current thermal regime in the Gulf has been cited as a model for the tropical ocean in 2090-2099. In light of it, foraminiferal assemblage structure, composition, and distribution may provide an insight into the nature of biotic response to future climate change in the Gulf region under conditions of global warming and a baseline for future comparison within and beyond the Gulf.

Reducing GHG emissions by changing the energy production mix is one option to reach targets being set by international communities. As the implementation of renewable and non-renewable energy infrastructure deployed in marine ecosystems increases, it is not clear how these changes will impact on the marine environment and the ecosystem services it provides. To address this knowledge gap a systematic mapping approach was applied, with three key aims: firstly, to provide an overview of the types of impacts being studied for the offshore components of nuclear, offshore oil & gas and offshore wind arrays; secondly to demonstrate how these impacts can be translated into ecosystem services; and finally to provide a searchable database of the results.Methods: Searches for relevant articles were carried out using academic and grey literature databases. A total of 2297 articles were sourced, which were screened using selection criteria that determined which subject populations, exposure types and outcomes were considered relevant. To translate these findings into ecosystem service impacts, the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) and Millennium Ecosystem Assessment frameworks were used to ensure relevance, transparency and replicability.Results: A total of 50 articles, which equated to 208 studies, spanning four decades since 1970, were selected and coded for the systematic map. Across all energy systems, benthic species were the most studied group. Following this, results then varied by group; marine birds and fish were most prevalent in studies of offshore wind; fish for offshore oil & gas studies; and pelagic organisms for nuclear. The outcome variables most investigated were changes in population and ecosystem function/process. Of all the ecosystem services associated with the studied impacts, regulating services were investigated most often, due to the large number of studies on benthic organisms. Cultural services, specific to offshore wind, were also prevalent.Discussion: The systematic map provides a searchable database of articles and their relevant studies on the local ecological impacts of marine renewable energies. It has identified a number of potential future areas for primary research; for example, investigating the impacts of decommissioning offshore energy infrastructure on marine habitats and organisms.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,0,6,,,,2047-2382,,,,,,,,,,"Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth, Devon, England",,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000449407300025,,,,,

The produced water is separated from the oil and gas and either reinjected into a deep formation or discharged to the ocean. The Norwegian oil and gas industry advocates ecological risk assessment as the basis for managing produced water discharges to the North Sea. In this paper, we compare estimates of ecological risks to water-column communities based on data on hydrocarbon residues in soft tissues of blue mussels deployed for a month near offshore platforms and based on predictions of the Dose related Risk and Effect Assessment Model (DREAM). The study was performed near produced water discharges to the Tampen and Ekofisk Regions of the Norwegian Sector of the North Sea. Because polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are considered the most important contributors to the ecological hazard posed by produced water discharges, comparisons made here focus on this group of compounds. The mussel approach is based on predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of individual PAH, estimated from PAH residues in mussels following deployment for a month near several produced water discharges, and predicted no effects concentrations (PNECs) based on a K-ow regression model. In the DREAM method, PECs for three PAH fractions are estimated in the three-dimensional area around produced water discharge with the DREAM model. PNECs for each fraction are based on the chronic toxicity of a representative PAH from each fraction divided by an assessment factor to account for uncertainty in the chronic value. The mussel method gives much lower estimates of ecological risk than the DREAM method. The differences are caused by the much lower PNECs used in DREAM than derived from the regression model, and by the lower concentrations of aqueous PAH predicted by DREAM than estimated from PAH residues in mussel tissues. However, the two methods rank stations at different distances from produced water discharges in the same order and both identify 2- and 3-ring PAHs as the main contributors to the ecological risk of produced water discharges. Neither method identifies a significant ecological risk of PAH in the upper water column of the oil fields. The DREAM model may produce an overly conservative estimate of ecological risk of produced water discharges to the North Sea. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Oil spills can be detected using some type of remote sensing data such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, but to determine of oil-spill origin is difficult. Oil spill hindcast models are commonly used to simulate the origin points. Surface winds, surface currents and random walk are three major parameters in the oil hindcast process. In coastal regions, the parameters are affected by offshore bathymetry, local weather, etc. In particular, random walk is more sensitive to the traits of coastal regions. However, most state-of-the-art hindcast models use an empirical and constant value for conducting random walk. In this paper, a random walk parameterization hindcast method (RWPHM) for the Bohai Sea is proposed, in which random walk is initially parameterized and combined with remote sensing data and oil-spill models. The backward-in-time method is validated using data for the Penglai 19-3 spill accident observed between June 11 and 19, 2011. The results confirm that the accuracy of random walk is significant for improving the accuracy of oil-spill hindcasting. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Over a 4-year period, we found a total of 166 bat carcasses from 10 species, mostly representing migratory species such as Pipistrellus nathusii and Nyctalus noctula. Most fatalities at WT occurred in July and August. We documented 15 cases of barotrauma and 34 cases of blunt-force trauma in carcasses found below WT. After adjusting for carcass removals and variations in searcher efficiency, we estimated for the 4-year study period a total of 2394 bat casualties at the studied WT facility consisting of 20 units, resulting in a mean fatality rate of 30 bats/WT/year, or 14.2 bats/MW/year. By implementing a curtailment measure at wind speeds below 6.5 m/s, we reduced fatality rates by 78%. Isoscape origin models based on hydrogen stable isotope ratios in fur keratin revealed that the majority of N. noctula that were killed by WT or captured nearby in mist nets originated from distant areas in the North (Ukraine, Belarus, Russia).

Our purpose was to develop and demonstrate a new, flexible tool that can be used for specific management and wind-energy planning applications when adequate data are available, rather than inform wind-energy development at this site. We demonstrate how the tool can be used 1) in marine spatial planning exercises to quantitatively identify setback distances under development scenarios given a risk threshold, 2) to examine the ecological and technical trade-offs of development alternatives to facilitate negotiation between objectives, and 3) in the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process to estimate collision fatality under alternative scenarios.

For this purpose, an in-depth experimental campaign was carried out using a 1:40 scale model of the wave energy converter sub-system and the monopile substructure, considering regular and irregular waves. Based on the experimental results the performance of the device and its interaction with the wave field were characterised a fundamental step to fully understand the benefits and limitations of this hybrid wind-wave system, which sets the basis for its future development. Regarding the performance, the best efficiency was obtained with the turbine damping corresponding to a 0.5% orifice size, and two resonance peaks were identified (T = 9 and 6 s). As for the interaction of the hybrid system with the wave field, between 5% and 66% of the incident wave power is reflected and between 3% and 45%, transmitted. The wave period was found to be the parameter that most influenced wave run-up on the substructure.

Studies o f this wider relevance should aim to improve understanding o f the economic and societal impacts of OWFs linked to ecosystem services that support fisheries, furtherm ore, assisting fisheries management and providing advice requires monitoring and survey data collection at appropriate spatiotemporal scales. This information will help to determine whether OWFs have any meaningful impact on regional fisheries, and increased investments will be needed to target scientifically appropriate monitoring of OWFs and fisheries, which is supported by belter integrated policy and regulation.",,,,,,,,,37,2,0,0,15,0,39,,,1042-8275,,,,,,,,,,,"Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft, Suffolk, EnglandRoyal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Operat Directorate Nat Environm Marine Ecol & Man, Brussels, BelgiumNOAA Fisheries, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Woods Hole, MA USAWageningen Marine Res, Den Helder, NetherlandsNOAA Fisheries, IBSS Corp, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Woods Hole, MA USA",,,,2021-02-03,WOS:000606322400015,,,,,

Simultaneous counts were carried out from six observation points in two separate areas (Karnobat and Sredets), located 24.5 km and 37.3 km inland from the Black Sea coast, respectively. In total, 31,049 soaring birds of at least 27 species were counted, by far the most numerous being the White Stork Ciconia ciconia (23,358 ind.), followed by the Lesser Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina (3,112 ind.). In Karnobat area, situated farther from the Black Sea coast, the total number of soaring migrants (21,231) was more than two-fold higher than in Sredets area (9,818). Overall, there was a significant difference in flock size and flight altitude within separate area (i.e. among observation points) as well as between the two observation areas and the three 5-day periods. However, there was a substantial variance in factors significantly affecting the flock size and flight altitude among most numerous individual species. In general, birds passed at much higher altitude above Karnobat area (mean flight altitude 208.3 m +/- 6.4) compared to Sredets area (mean flight altitude 130.5 m +/- 4.4). In both observation areas, northern direction was the most commonly observed flight direction (46.3% of all recorded flight directions). The highest numbers of soaring migrants passed in the late afternoon, between 15.00 and 18.00 hrs - 11,554 individuals (43.0% of all birds counted). The study confirmed that the front of Western Black Sea migration route, or Via Pontica as part of the Mediterranean/Black Sea Flyway in SE Bulgaria, is rather wide, since the magnitude of inland migration in Bourgas district can be compared with that along the Black Sea coast, at least during spring migration. Both observation areas qualify as Important Bird Areas (IBA) of European importance according to the several BirdLife International criteria.

The Brazilian population of C. limbata increased significantly over the past 5years and the effect on C. multilineata is still an open question, longer time-series data will be necessary to clarify possible interactions. The molecular analyses confirmed species identity, revealed strong haplotype connectivity among Brazilian study sites and showed a low genetic diversity in Brazil when compared with the native populations, suggesting few individuals started the invasion. Four hypotheses could explain this colonizing event: C. limbata was released by aquarium fish keepers; larvae or juveniles were transported via ship ballast water; the species has rafted alongside oil rigs; they crossed the Atlantic Ocean through normal larval dispersal or naturally rafting alongside drifting objects.

We also examine the effects of fisheries closures and impacts on recruitment. We validate predictions of the model by comparing population trends and age structure before and after the oil spill with fisheries independent data. The model suggests that recruitment effects and fishery closures had little influence on biomass dynamics. However, at the assumed level of oil concentrations and toxicity, impacts on fish mortality and growth rates were large and commensurate with observations. Sensitivity analysis suggests the biomass of large reef fish decreased by 25% to 50% in areas most affected by the spill, and biomass of large demersal fish decreased even more, by 40% to 70%. Impacts on reef and demersal forage caused starvation mortality in predators and increased reliance on pelagic forage. Impacts on the food web translated effects of the spill far away from the oiled area. Effects on age structure suggest possible delayed impacts on fishery yields.

Results showed that fish farms are acting as a new habitat for the settlement of juvenile fish and that detected abundance could be compared with that found at natural habitats such as shallow rocky environments. However, a consistent pattern for all the studied species was a significant variation in otolith-shape descriptors, principally identified through the Aspect Ratio index, which was lower for the farm-associated species Atherina boyeri, Oblada melanura, and Sarpa salpa. Otolith modifications were effectively detected by elliptic Fourier descriptors since multivariate analysis correctly identified farm or control origin at 78.8, 85.1, and 86.1% for A. boyeri, O. melanura, and S. salpa individuals, respectively.

Open sea bird counts from a ship were carried out along the same transects in spring, summer and autumn in the years 2015 and 2016 in the Gulf of Finland. Only stopover birds in the 300 m wide transect belt were analysed. Partial redundancy analysis and linear mixed effect models were used. The total count was 12 491 individuals from 19 species.

Bird counts showed that on the open sea, protected and vulnerable species were numerous. Results showed, that count period and depth of the sea were important factors describing bird species composition, richness and abundance. Bird species richness was highest in spring, average in summer and lowest in autumn. Species richness was statistically different between spring and autumn counts. Bird abundance was highest in spring and autumn and lowest in summer, but the differences were not statistically significant. The results indicate that different species use open-sea habitat in relation to change in species composition, which is related in turn to phenology. Species richness and abundance were higher in shallower seas (sea depth < 20 m). This is probably related to food procurement, which is easier in shallower seas.

Since experimentation in sea may often be difficult, expensive or unnecessary at a conceptual or at pre-commercial stage, scaled experimentation in wave tanks can be central to the understanding and assessment of their dynamic responses. This paper presents scaled dynamic testing in a wave tank of a tension leg platform for supporting a wind turbine for different regular wave conditions and sea states characterised by the Bretschneider spectra. The dynamic response of the device was monitored at different locations on the device using load cells and with a camera based motion recognition system. For the analysis, a frequency response function based approach was considered to illustrate the response of the device under varied wave loading conditions. The experimentation does not assume any underlying theoretical model, apart from the consideration of Froude scaling conditions to attempt to link experimentation conditions with actual conditions. The results are important for characterisation of theoretical models and fitting parameters of such theoretical models, while identifying the limits and potential challenges of applying linear dynamic analysis in these situations. The findings are also important for establishing system identification and control strategies for undesirable levels of dynamic response. The fitted models based on physical modelling, when combined with scaled experimental responses, can also be helpful in better estimating extreme responses of the devices.",,,,,10th International Conference on Damage Assessment of Structures (DAMAS)10th International Conference on Damage Assessment of Structures (DAMAS),"JUL 08-10, 2013JUL 08-10, 2013","Sys Wind; Inst Phys, Appl Mech Grp; Failte Ireland; Meetinireland com; Seventh Framework Programme; Marie Curie ActSys Wind; Inst Phys, Appl Mech Grp; Failte Ireland; Meetinireland com; Seventh Framework Programme; Marie Curie Act","Trinity Coll, Dublin, IRELANDTrinity Coll, Dublin, IRELAND",4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,1013-9826,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Univ Coll Cork, Hydraul & Maritime Res Ctr, Cork, IrelandUniv Coll Cork, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Dynam Syst & Risk Lab, Cork, Ireland",,,,2013-12-18,WOS:000326409000070,,,,,

Autonomous vehicles (like AUVs and gliders) or teleoperated ones (like ROVs) are currently employed for executing a number of different underwater tasks, like inspecting submerged pipes, executing maintenance interventions on underwater gas- or oil-platforms, collecting environmental or oceanographic data, performing surveys on sites of archeological interest. In parallel with the development of underwater vehicles, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), are they also witnessing an increasing interest from the robotic community, especially with the goal of performing surveillance applications, like patrolling and maintaining safeguarded against intruders harbours or other crucial sites. The potential benefits offered by automated vessels equipped with sensors such as cameras or sonars are quite evident, since they could be used to quickly identify the level of menace of unknown radar track without exposing any human operators to possible threats. However USVs, unlike in the underwater case, have to face the problem of avoiding other vessels which in most cases are manned ones. This is a crucial point especially in that kind of application, where the automated vessel has to move quickly towards a possible menace while at the same time avoiding all the other boats normally operating in the harbour area. Unfortunately, at the current state of art, a reliable methodology to avoid the other vessels and the availability of effective and accurate obstacle detection sensors is still missing. This paper focus its attention on the case of USV used for security applications within a harbour, devising a solution that can be real-time implemented for the obstacle avoidance problem under critical situations where the vehicle as to reach its target as fast as possible while guaranteeing the safety of the other vessels. The presented solution is based on a three layered hierarchical architecture: the first layer computes a global path taking into account static obstacles known a priori, the second layer modifies this path in a locally optimal way (under certain assumptions) exploiting kinematic data of the moving obstacles, while the last layer reactively avoids obstacles for which such data is not available. The paper will be therefore organized as follows: in the first section an introduction and state of art are presented, in the successive section the work will discuss the first layer and the methods for the static obstacles avoidance, while in the third the paper will focus on the moving obstacles and the proposed avoidance algorithm, while also presenting many different detailed simulation results regarding the performances achievable by the overall architecture.

Blastula-stage embryonic cells (EC) from fertilized eggs of Atlantic cod were isolated and exposed to environmental relevant concentrations of Ra-226 and transcription of selected genes quantified. The results showed a weak, but significant up-regulation of GPx3 and HSP70 transcripts after 48 h of exposure to 2.11 Bq/L. In EC exposed to three Ra-226 concentrations (2.11, 23 and 117 Bq/L) for 12 h, metallothionein, HSP90AA, thioredoxin and caspase 8 were significantly up-regulated in cells exposed to 117 Bq/L, whereas thioredoxin was also significantly up-regulated in EC exposed to 23 Bq/L. When EC were exposed to the same Ra-226 concentrations for 48 h, only heme oxygenase was significantly up-regulated in the 23 Bq/L exposure group. The results suggest that environmentally relevant activities of Ra-226 may induce oxidative stress and apoptosis in fish ECs.

To take full advantage of the large datasets provided by radars, researchers have implemented machine learning (ML) techniques that automatically read and attempt to classify targets. Here we used data collected from two locations in Portugal with two marine radar antennas (VSR and HSR) to apply and compare the performance of six ML algorithms that are widely used in the literature: random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural networks (NN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and decision trees (DT), all trained with several dataset configurations. We found that all algorithms performed well (area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) and accuracy >0.80, P<0.001) when discriminating birds from non-biological targets such as vehicles, rain or wind turbines, but greater variance in the performance among algorithms was apparent when separating different bird functional groups or bird species (e.g. herons vs. gulls). In our case study, only RF was able to hold an accuracy >0.80 for all classification tasks, although SVM and DT also performed well. Further, all algorithms correctly classified 86% and 66% (VSR and HSR) of the target points, and only 2% and 4% of these points were misclassified by all algorithms. Our results suggest that ML algorithms are suitable for classifying radar targets as birds, and thereby separating them from other non-biological targets. The ability of these algorithms to correctly identify among bird species functional groups was found to be much weaker, but if properly trained and supported by a good ground truthing dataset, targeted to the relevant species groups, some of these algorithms are still able to achieve high accuracies in classification tasks. Such results indicate that ML algorithms are suitable for use in near real-time monitoring of bird movements, and may help to mitigate collision of birds with, for example, wind turbines or airplanes.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,8,0,23,,,0019-1019,1474-919X,,,,,,,,,,"Bio3 Estudos & Projectos Biol & Valorizacao Recur, Lda Rua Antero Quental, P-2675690 Odivelas, PortugalUniv London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, EnglandBioinsight Ambiente & Biodiversidade, Lda Rua Antero Quental, P-2675960 Odivelas, PortugalUniv Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, PortugalUniv Aveiro, CESAM, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Bio3 Estudos & Projectos Biol & Valorizacao RecurBioinsight Ambiente & Biodiversidade,,,2016-02-17,WOS:000368727700003,,,,,

Biofouling is considered a specific problem for a wide range of coastal and marine industries, including aquaculture, shipping activities and ports. Colonization and growth of biofouling depend on the complex interactions of biological, physical and chemical factors. Anthropogenic disturbances from coastal modification and water pollution can affect biofouling communities. The coastline of the Arabian Gulf is influenced by marine pollution from a variety of land-based activities. This study investigated spatial and temporal aspects of macrofouling assemblages using experimental panels in a marina and a mariculture centre in Bahrain for a period of one year (2014). Macrofouling assemblages of the two sites differed distinctly in species richness and composition. A total of 38 species was recorded in the mariculture centre compared to eleven species in the marina. Assemblages in the mariculture centre were dominated by hydrozoans, actinozoans, ascidians and sponges, while those in the marina were dominated by tubeworms and barnacles. Different successional patterns were observed in the sampling sites. The sequence of species replacements started by green algae and hydrozoans, followed by actinozoans, ascidians and sponges in the mariculture centre. Brown and green algae, tubeworms and hydrozoans were the earliest successional groups followed by barnacles in the marina. The study provided an initial characterization for the variability of macrofouling assemblages in the naturally and anthropogenically stressed marine environment of the Arabian Gulf.

Equations of motion in 6 degrees of freedom are formulated in the frequency domain. Time domain aerodynamic loads are derived from a double multiple stream tube model based Paraschivoiu [13]. These loads are transposed to the frequency domain and integrated with a formulation of the gyroscopic moments acting for the wind turbine rotating and the semi-submersible rotating in roll and pitch due to ocean waves. The paper uses this model to explore the effect of gyroscopic effects on the motions of the turbine and semisubmersible. It is shown that the gyroscopic effect has negligible effects on some modes of motion but that it introduces significant motions at key frequencies related to rotor speed.

Lateral soil springs were used according to the American Petroleum Institute (API) Code for p-y curves, while vertical soil springs were generated according to the t-z and q-z API standards. A modal analysis was performed to verify the joint CFD-FEM exhibited a fundamental frequency in the desired range. A verification of the load applications was completed for maximum force and moment under specific wind and wave loading parameters. Deflection results were generated and compared with reliable results published in past studies. Results reveal that a variation in wind speed has a higher impact on soil structure interaction causing a larger deflection than a variance in the significant wave height.

The occurrence of hydrates below these landslides indicates that these slope instabilities may be closely related to the massive release of methane. In this study, we used a simple Monte-Carlo model to determine the first-order deformation pattern of a gravitationally destabilizing slope. The results show that a stress concentration occurs due to hydrate dissociation on the nearby glide surface and on top of a gas chimney structure. Upon the dissolution of the gas hydrate, slope failure occurs due to the excess pore pressure generated by the dissociation of the gas hydrates. When gas hydrates dissociate at shallow depths, the excess pore pressure generated can be greater than the total stress acting at those points, along with the forces that resist sliding. Initially, the failure occurs at the toe of the slope, then extends to the interior. Although our investigation focused only on the contribution of hydrate decomposition to submarine landslide, this process is also affected by both the slope material properties and topography.",,,,,,,,,11,3,0,0,1,0,12,,,1672-5182,1993-5021,,,,,,,,,,"Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Evaluat & Detect Technol Lab Marine Mineral Resou, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R ChinaQingdao Inst Marine Geol, Gas Hydrate Geol Div, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R ChinaOcean Univ China, Coll Marine Geosci, Qingao 266100, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Deep Sea Sci & Engn, Lab Marine Geophys & Georesources, Sanya 572000, Peoples R ChinaQingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R ChinaMLR, Guangzhou Marine Geol Survey, Guangzhou 510760, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000419533800013,,,,,

Evaluating this risk at fine spatial and temporal scales can be challenging, especially in systems where wildlife-vehicle collisions are rare or imperfectly detected. The sizes and behaviors of wildlife and vehicles influence collision risk, as well as how much they co-occur in space and time. We applied a modeling framework based on encounter theory to quantify the risk of lethal collisions between endangered North Atlantic right whales and vessels. Using Automatic Identification System vessel traffic data and spatially explicit estimates of right whale abundance that account for imperfect detection, we modeled risk at fine spatiotemporal scales before and after implementation of a vessel speed rule in the southeastern United States. The expected seasonal mortality rates of right whales decreased by 22% on average after the speed rule was implemented, indicating that the rule is effective at reducing lethal collisions. The rule's effect on risk was greatest where right whales were abundant and vessel traffic was heavy, and its effect varied considerably across time and space. Our framework is spatiotemporally flexible, process-oriented, computationally efficient and accounts for uncertainty, making it an ideal approach for evaluating many wildlife management policies, including those regarding collisions between wildlife and vehicles and cases in which wildlife may encounter other dangerous features such as wind farms, seismic surveys, or fishing gear.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,15,0,17,,,2150-8925,,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USAUS Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32653 USAUS Geol Survey, St Petersburg Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",,,,2019-04-01,WOS:000472716600051,,,,,

The English Channel, an epi-continental shallow sea with very strong tides, runs along 650 km of the French coast and 1100 km of the English coast. It is also a bio-geographical crossroad encompassing a much wider range of ecological conditions than other European seas. France's Atlantic coast north of the Gironde estuary is a succession of rocky and sandy shorelines, including a sizeable intertidal zone, a wide continental shelf, and two major estuaries (Loire and Gironde). South of the Gironde, the 260 km of coastline is low, sandy and straight, with a narrowing continental shelf further on South due to the presence of the Cape Breton canyon in the bathyal and abyssal zones. Interface between the continental and oceanic systems, these bordering seas - North Sea, English Channel and Atlantic Ocean - have been the subject of many recent research programmes (the European Mast-FLUX-MANCHE and INTERREG programmes; the national coastal environment programme and the LITEAU programme in France), designed to improve comprehension of the functions, production, and dynamics of these seas as well as their future evolution. Given the many conflicting practices in these littoral zones, integrated coastal zone management appears to be essential in order to cope with both natural phenomena, such as the infilling of estuarine zones, cliff erosion, and rising sea levels, and chronic anthropogenic pressures, such as new harbour installations (container dikes, marinas), sea aggregate extraction for human constructions, and offshore wind mill farms. This article provides as complete an overview as possible of the research projects on these bordering seas, both those that have recently been accomplished and those that are currently in progress, in order to highlight the main characteristics of these ecosystems and to underline the future challenges for European marine research in terms of the integrated coastal zone management of these highly significant coastal zones.

It is unclear what attracts the birds to this area, especially as the food composition of seabirds outside the breeding season is notoriously difficult to study. To obtain information on prey species composition of red-throated divers in this area, faecal samples from 34 birds caught alive were analysed using DNA metabarcoding. Prey DNA was detected in 85% of the samples with a mean number of 4.2 +/- 0.7 taxa per sample (n=29). Altogether, we found a broad prey spectrum with 19 fish taxa from 13 families dominated by five groups: clupeids, mackerel, gadoids, flatfish and sand lances with clupeids being the most frequently detected prey. Our results indicate that red-throated divers are generalist opportunistic feeders in the German Bight, but pelagic schooling fish that aggregate at frontal zones and have a high energetic value might be favoured. Atlantic mackerel appears to be a more important prey for red-throated divers in this area than previously thought. The precision achievable using metabarcoding has revealed a number of prey species that are consumed by red-throated divers in the German Bight, which helps to explain the selection of this area by divers in winter and spring.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,16,0,18,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,,,,,,,"Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Anim Ecol & Systemat, D-35392 Giessen, GermanyBioConsult SH, D-25813 Husum, GermanyDHI, DK-2970 Horsholm, DenmarkKlaipeda Univ, Marine Res Inst, LT-92294 Klaipeda, LithuaniaCardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Biosci, Sir Martin Evans Bldg, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, WalesUniv Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, NERC Biomol Anal Facil, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, EnglandOrnitela UAB, LT-03228 Vilnius, LithuaniaNovia Univ Appl Sci, Raseborgsvagen 9, Ekenas 10600, Finland",BioConsult SHOrnitela UAB,,,2019-06-01,WOS:000468192200004,,,,,

Contemporary wind resource assessment frameworks incorporate diverse multiscale prognostic models (commonly known as mesoscale models) to dynamically downscale global-scale atmospheric fields to regional-scale (i.e., spatial and temporal resolutions of a few kilometers and a few minutes, respectively). These high-resolution model solutions aim at depicting the expected wind behavior (e. g., wind shear, wind veering and topographically induced flow accelerations) at a particular location. Coastal and offshore regions considered viable for wind power production are also known to possess complex atmospheric flow phenomena (including, but not limited to, coastal low-level jets (LLJs), internal boundary layers and land breeze-sea breeze circulations). Unfortunately, the capabilities of the new-generation mesoscale models in realistically capturing these diverse flow phenomena are not well documented in the literature. To partially fill this knowledge gap, in this paper, we have evaluated the performance of the Weather Research and Forecasting model, a state-of-the-art mesoscale model, in simulating a series of coastal LLJs. Using observational data sources we explore the importance of coastal LLJs for offshore wind resource estimation along with the capacity to which they can be numerically simulated. We observe model solutions to demonstrate strong sensitivities with respect to planetary boundary layer parameterization and initialization conditions. These sensitivities are found to be responsible for variability in AEP estimates by a factor of two.

Species identification is time-consuming, and one solution is to identify organisms to a taxonomic level higher than species. This study, using data from a survey in the vicinity of the Valhall oil field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, examines the effects of using abundances of different taxonomic levels, and of using different data transformations (used to adjust the relative weightings of rare and abundant taxa) in subsequent multivariate analyses of faunal patterns, and relates the environmental variables to the observed faunal patterns from the different analyses. The study area has a constant water depth, homogeneous bottom sediment and a uniform benthic community. At the time of the survey the platform had been active for 9 yr, and strong gradients in environmental contaminants and related faunal changes were found. Data from 27 stations around the oil platform were analysed at the levels of species, genus, family, order, class and phylum, using a range of data transformations and multivariate techniques. The data matrix contained 156 species grouped into 138 genera, 102 families, 42 orders, 18 classes and 10 phyla. Matrices derived from species, genus and family abundances constructed using the same transformation are very similar, and even at higher taxonomic levels the gradient of change in community structure is still detectable. As the taxonomic level increases the effects of transformations become stronger, so although both taxonomic resolution and transformation affect the results of analyses, the effects of each are different and, to a large extent, unrelated. The highest correlations between matrices derived from measured environmental variables and biotic matrices are between environmental variables related to drilling activity and mildly transformed family abundances, suggesting that analyses of higher taxonomic levels are more likely to reflect a contamination gradient than are analyses based on species abundances. Before any general recommendations regarding taxonomic levels are given for future macrobenthic surveys, there is an obvious need for studies of weak, intermediate and strong gradients in various types of contamination in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments, using the same sampling and analysis methods.",,,,,,,,,163,6,0,0,106,1,176,,,0171-8630,,,,,,,,,,,"PLYMOUTH MARINE LAB, PLYMOUTH PL1 3DH, DEVON, ENGLAND",,,,1997-04-01,WOS:A1997XA14600016,,,,,

While no significant difference in these activities was observed between L. campechanus and L. griseus, when all three snappers (Lutjanidae) were grouped together L. campechanus swimming activity significantly decreased in the presence of both tropically-associated species. Overall, L. campechanus were more active and aggressive predators and appear to be competitively resistant to L. griseus and L. synagris. As lower latitude species have continued to become increasingly prevalent in nGOM habitats and regional warming continues to affect resident reef-associated fishes, these findings contribute to the assessment of the effects of warming-related species shifts upon nGOM fishes and document current partial resilience of L. campechanus to climate-related expansions of tropical confamilials.

In summer 2008, the nature restoration project Blue Reef re-established 45 000 m(2) of cavernous stony reef at L so Trindel in the northern Kattegat, Denmark. To investigate whether the re-established reef attracts harbour porpoises, the acoustic activity of porpoises was monitored by static acoustic data loggers, T-PODs, before and after the restoration project. T-PODs were placed at the L so Trindel reef and at a reference station 10 km away between June and August from 2006 to 2012. Results showed that porpoise activity increased significantly at L so Trindel reef after the reconstruction in 2008. The number of minutes with porpoise recordings (PPM) increased on average from 9.5 PPM per day in 2006 to a maximum in 2010 (15.2 PPM per day) followed by a small decrease (12.75 PPM per day in 2012). An increase in mean encounter duration from 3.0 min in 2006 to 4.7 min in 2010 (3.7 min in 2012) showed that porpoises not only appeared more often, but also stayed longer at L so Trindel. Furthermore, there was a striking diel pattern in porpoise activity at L so Trindel, with significantly higher activity during the night. This pattern became increasingly apparent over the study period. At the reference station, in contrast, most activity took place during the day throughout the study.

Shellfish farming is an expanding segment of marine aquaculture, but environmental effects of this industry are only beginning to be considered.2. The interaction between off-bottom, suspended oyster farming and wintering sea Clucks in coastal British Columbia was studied. Specifically. the habitat use of surf scoters (Melanitta perspicillata) and Barrow's goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica), the most abundant sea duck species ill the Study area. was evaluated ill relation to natural environmental attributes and shellfish aquaculture.3. The extent of shellfish farming was the best-supported habitat variable explaining variation in surf scoter densities, and the only habitat attribute from the considered set that was a strong, predictor of Barrow's goldeneye densities. In both cases. the findings indicated strong positive relationships between densities of sea ducks and shellfish aquaculture operations. These relationships are presumably the result of large numbers of wild mussels (Mytilus trossulus) that settle and grow oil aquaculture structures and Lire preferred prey of these sea ducks.4. Previous work has shown that aquaculture Structures provide good conditions for recruiting and growing Mussels. including refuge from invertebrate predators. which in turn provides higher densities of higher quality prey for sea ducks than available in intertidal areas. This offers a rare example in which introduction of an industry leads to positive effects on wildlife populations, which is particularly important given persistent decline in numbers of many sea ducks.

By contrast, exposure to both crude and condensate oil films >= 3 mu m resulted in significant increases in feather mass and clumping. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the influence of oil on feather structure when compiling threat assessments involving seabirds.",,,,,,,,,8,1,0,0,9,1,9,,,0025-326X,1879-3363,,,,,,,,,,"Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",,,,2019-02-15,WOS:000457512500016,30660254,,,,

Standard spatial planning approaches, such as a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), may be challenging and time consuming to interpret in heavily utilized ocean spaces. Spatial autocorrelation, a statistical measure of spatial dependence, may be incorporated into the planning framework, which provides objectivity and assistance with the interpretation of spatial analysis results. Here, two case studies highlighting applications of spatial autocorrelation analyses in the northeast region of the United States of America are presented. The first case study demonstrates the use of a local indicator of spatial association analysis within a relative site suitability analysis - a variant of a MCDA - for siting a mussel longline farm. This case study statistically identified 17% of the area as highly suitable for a mussel longline farm, relative to other locations in the area of interest. The use of a clear, objective, and efficient analysis provides improved confidence for industry, coastal managers, and stakeholders planning marine aquaculture. The second case study presents an incremental spatial autocorrelation analysis with Moran's I that is performed on modeled and remotely sensed oceanographic data sets (e.g., chlorophyll a, sea surface temperature, and current speed). The results are used to establish a maximum area threshold for each oceanographic variable within the online decision support tool, OceanReports, which performs an automated spatial analysis for a user-selected area (i.e., drawn polygon) of ocean space. These thresholds provide users guidance and summary statistics of relevant oceanographic information for aquaculture planning. These two case studies highlight practical uses and the value of spatial autocorrelation analyses to improve the siting process for marine aquaculture.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,7,0,19,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"CSS Inc, NOAA, Fairfax, VA 22030 USANature Conservancy, 1815 N Lynn St, Arlington, VA USANOAA, Natl Ocean Serv, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Beaufort, NC USA",,,,2020-01-30,WOS:000508611300001,,,,,

Knowledge of statistical properties such as the spatial and temporal correlations of real turbulent wind fields increases the realism of the simulated simulated wind fields. The statistical properties of real turbulent wind fields have been shown to depend on quantities such as the surface roughness, the mean wind speed, measurement height and atmospheric stability. The Mann spectral tensor attempts to predict all spatial correlations of shear generated turbulence given only three input parameters. The most suitable such input values have been investigated for different onshore surface roughnesses, but so far not for typical off shore conditions. The meteorological mast at the Rodsand II off shore wind farm has among other instruments sonic anemometers mounted at 15, 40 and 57 meters above sea level. Wind speed spectra at the three heights are calculated and binned with respect to both wind speed and atmospheric stability. The three parameters of the Mann spectral tensor are determined to ensure best fit to the spectra of each of the bins and are presented as a function of mean wind speed, measurement height and atmospheric stability. The behaviour of the presented parameters values are largely consistent with the previous onshore results. The parameter values are also compared to potentially related quantities and a constant quantity is derived. Given optimal parameters the spectral tensor is found to reproduce the surface layer generated turbulence well, also for different atmospheric stabilities, however in the wind speed spectra a contribution from the very large scale quasi-geostrophic turbulence is also observed, a contribution the spectral tensor does not attempt to model.",,,,,5th Science of Making Torque from Wind Conference5th Science of Making Torque from Wind Conference,"JUN 18-20, 2014JUN 18-20, 2014",European Acad Wing EnergyEuropean Acad Wing Energy,"Tech Univ Denmark, Copenhagen, DENMARKTech Univ Denmark, Copenhagen, DENMARK",10,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,1742-6588,1742-6596,*****************,,,,,,,,,"DONG Energy AS, Copenhagen, DenmarkRis DTU, Wind Energy Dept, Risskov, Denmark",DONG Energy AS,,,2014-12-10,WOS:000344193600106,,,,,

Our major objective is to conduct year-round, scientifically robust surveys to document seabird and mammal diversity, distribution, and abundance in relation to hydrocarbon activity and oceanography. Surveys along a fixed support vessel route between St. John's, NL and offshore platforms are limited by narrow spatial coverage yet have wide temporal coverage and repeatability. Twenty-one surveys, including the first winter surveys to platforms, were conducted from 1999 through 2003. Oiled murres and dovekies, the species most susceptible to oil pollution, were recorded at the Hibernia platform during February and November when the risk of mortality due to thermal stress is greatest. Roosting gulls were recorded feeding at night on fish, apparently attracted by platform illumination. Marine mammals were observed at offshore platforms. Humpback and minke whales were the most common mammals and were seen within 5-10 meters of the Hibernia platform. The abundance of stormpetrels and shearwaters near Hibernia was highest during fall and spring migratory periods, when millions of these species move onto the shelf. These are critical periods for potential mortality from flaring, oiling, and collisions. It is environmentally and ethically essential to continue independent, scientifically rigorous surveys of seabirds in relation to ongoing hydrocarbon activities. Assessments could be greatly enhanced with independent, year-round scientifically valid observation procedures on platforms. Without such surveys, it is impossible to document seabird mortality associated with marine hydrocarbon activity in eastern Canada, and hence not possible to effectively mitigate negative environmental effects.",,,,,Offshore Oil and Gas Environmental Effects Monitoring WorkshopOffshore Oil and Gas Environmental Effects Monitoring Workshop,"MAY 26-30, 2003MAY 26-30, 2003",Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board; Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board; Canadian Assoc Petroleum Producers; Ctr Offshore Oil & Gas Environm Res; Environm Canada; Environm Studies Res Fund; Fisheries & Oceans Canada; Natl Energy Board; Petroleum Res Atlantic Canada; Program Energy Res & DevCanada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board; Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board; Canadian Assoc Petroleum Producers; Ctr Offshore Oil & Gas Environm Res; Environm Canada; Environm Studies Res Fund; Fisheries & Oceans Canada; Natl Energy Board; Petroleum Res Atlantic Canada; Program Energy Res & Dev,"Bedford Inst Oceanography, Dartmouth, CANADABedford Inst Oceanography, Dartmouth, CANADA",13,0,0,0,9,0,16,,,,,1-57477-146-9,,,,,,,,,"Mem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000227173500028,,,,,

The off-coast remoteness of the windfarms, particular environmental conditions, limitations in offshore structure access, working in heights and depths, and the vast extent of the offshore windfarms cause significant challenges for offshore rescue. Emergency response systems comparable to onshore procedures are not fully established yet. Further, rescue from offshore windfarms is not part of the duty of the German Maritime Search and Rescue Organization or SAR-Services due to statute and mandate reasons. Scientific recommendations or guidelines for rescue from offshore windfarms are not available yet.The present article reflects the current state of medical care and rescue from German offshore windfarms and related questions. The extended therapy-free interval until arrival of the rescue helicopter requires advanced first-aid measures as well as improved first-aider qualification. Rescue helicopters need to be equipped with a winch system in order to dispose rescue personnel on the wind turbines, and to hoist-up patients. For redundancy reasons and for conducting rendezvous procedures, adequate sea-bound rescue units need to be provided. In the light of experiences from the offshore oil and gas industry and first offshore wind analyses, the availability of professional medical personnel in offshore windfarms seems advisible. Operational air medical rescue services and specific offshore emergency reaction teams have established a powerful rescue chain. Besides the present development of medical standards, more studies are necessary in order to place the rescue chain on a long-term, evidence-based groundwork.

The turbines were in deep (>40 m) water, 25 km from the Moray Firth Special Area of Conservation (SAC), potentially affecting a protected population of bottlenose dolphins. We measured pile-driving noise at distances of 0.1 (maximum broadband peak to peak sound level 205 dB re 1 mu Pa) to 80 km (no longer distinguishable above background noise). These sound levels were related to noise exposure criteria for marine mammals to assess possible effects. For bottlenose dolphins, auditory injury would only have occurred within 100 m of the pile-driving and behavioural disturbance, defined as modifications in behaviour, could have occurred up to 50 km away.

Statistical models are used to estimate natural variability, pre-existing trends, and environmental predictors of baseline indicator conditions. Establishing standard models for baseline characterization is critical to the effective design and implementation of environmental monitoring programs. An anthropogenic activity that requires monitoring is the development of Marine Renewable Energy sites. Currently, there are no standards for the analysis of environmental monitoring data for these development sites. Marine Renewable Energy monitoring data are used as a case study to develop and apply a model evaluation to establish best practices for characterizing baseline ecological indicator data. We examined a range of models, including six generalized regression models, four time series models, and three nonparametric models. Because monitoring data are not always normally distributed, we evaluated model ability to characterize normal and non-normal data using hydroacoustic metrics that serve as proxies for ecological indicator data. The nonparametric support vector regression and random forest models, and parametric state-space time series models generally were the most accurate in interpolating the normal metric data. Support vector regression and state-space models best interpolated the non-normally distributed data. If parametric results are preferred, then state-space models are the most robust for baseline characterization. Evaluation of a wide range of models provides a comprehensive characterization of the case study data, and highlights advantages of models rarely used in Marine Renewable Energy environmental monitoring.

Killifish collected from Grande Terre had divergent gene expression in the liver and gill tissue coincident with the arrival of contaminating oil and up-regulation of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) protein in gill, liver, intestine, and head kidney for over one year following peak landfall of oil (August 2011) compared to fish collected from reference sites. Furthermore, laboratory exposures of Gulf killifish embryos to field-collected sediments from Grande Terre and Barataria Bay, LA, also resulted in increased CYP1A and developmental abnormalities when exposed to sediments collected from oiled sites compared to exposure to sediments collected from a reference site.

By analyzing the scaling behavior of freak wave formation in a model of two interacting waves, described by two coupled non-linear Schrodinger equations, we show that there are two different dynamical scaling behaviors above and below a critical angle theta(c) of the direction of the interacting waves, below which all wave systems evolve and display statistics similar to a wave system of non-interacting waves. The results equally apply to other systems described by the non-linear Schrodinger equations, and should be of interest when designing optical wave guides.

The nematodes and harpacticoid copepods species in the area ranging from the species which are absent from the vicinity of the effluents to the species which occur predominantly in the most highly polluted sediments display a spectrum of responses to the discharges. It is thought at least some of the species favouring the immediate vicinity of the effluent channels would be associated with the dense microalgal mat that fringes the channels. Two factors seemed to be dominant in controlling the species distribution of nematodes and harpacticoid copepods in the area; interdal height and pollution. Cluster analysis of the species abundance data from the sampling stations clearly showed the separation of sites on the upper, middle and lower shore. The ordination of the stations was also strongly influenced by intertidal height superimposed by pollution.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0126-6128,,,,,,,,,,,"MARINE SCI NAT RESOURCES, UNIVERSITI KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA, SABAH CAMPUS, LB 62, 88996-KOTA KINABALU, SABAH",,,,1990-01-01,BCI:BCI199090141032,,,,,

Bright light treatment of 30 min per exposure was applied during the first 4 nights of the night-shift period and the first 4 days at home following the shift period. The bright light exposure was scheduled individually to phase delay the circadian rhythm. Bright light treatment modestly facilitated the subjective adaptation to night work, but the positive effect of bright light was especially pronounced during the re-adaptation back to day life following the return home. Sleepiness was reduced and the quality of day was rated better after exposure to bright light. The modest effect of bright light at the platform was, possibly, related to the finding that the workers seemed to adapt to night work within a few days even without bright light. These results suggest that short-term bright light treatment may help the adaptation to an extended night-work period, and especially the subsequent re-adaptation to day life.",,,,,,,,,65,3,0,0,31,0,74,,,0962-1105,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bergen, Div Gen Practice, N-5009 Bergen, NorwayIPM, S-17177 Stockholm, SwedenKarolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden",IPM,,,1999-06-01,WOS:000081304100003,10389092,,,,

Here we tested the effects of a large bio-engineering fanworm Sabella spallanzanii (Sabella) versus worm-like structures (mimics) on gas and nutrient fluxes in a marine soft bottom sediment. Experimental plots of sediment in Hauraki Gulf (New Zealand) were used to test the hypothesis that ecosystem engineers negatively influence benthic ecosystem function through autogenic mechanisms, facilitating activity by biofouling organisms and competitive exclusion of native infauna. Enhanced physical structure associated with Sabella and mimics increased nitrogen fluxes, community metabolism and reduced denitrification from 23 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) to zero at densities greater than 25 m(2). Sabella plots on average had greater respiration (29%), NH4 release (33%), and greater NO3 release (52%) compared to mimics, suggesting allogenic (biological) mechanisms occur, but play a secondary role to autogenic (physical) mechanisms. The dominance of autogenic mechanisms indicates that bio-engineers are likely to cause significant impacts when established, regardless of fundamental differences in recipient regions or identity of the introduced bio-engineer.

The study also consolidates recently available data with information from the two indices to consider developments in our understanding of how seabirds respond to MREDs and to present up-to-date vulnerability predictions. Results indicate greater uncertainty in data regarding displacement caused by vessels and/or helicopters, and use of tidal races by seabirds, than in data regarding the percentage of flight overlapping with wind turbine blades and the level of displacement caused by structures. Results also indicate varying uncertainty among species. Overall vulnerability rankings remained broadly the same, with some minor changes.

The present review sought to summarize and discuss findings from the 50+ peer-reviewed publications reporting effects of DWH oil exposure on teleost fish, and concludes that oil toxicity is a multi-target, multi-organ syndrome with substantial species- specific sensitivity differences. Of the 15 species tested with characterized exposures, 20% show effects at concentrations < 1 mu g l(-1) while 50% display effects at < 8.6 mu g 1(-1) Sigma PAH(50), concentrations well within the range of reported environmental levels during the spill. Cardiotoxic effects are among the most frequently reported endpoints in DWH oil exposure studies and are thought to have significant downstream effects on fitness and survival. However, additional and possibly cardio-toxic independent impacts on sensory function and behavior are reported at very low exposure concentrations (< 1 mu g l(-1) Sigma PAH(50)) and are clearly deserving of further study. Available information about modes of action leading to different categories of effects are summarized in the present review. An overview of the literature illustrates that early life stages (ELS) are approximately 1-order of magnitude more sensitive than corresponding later life stages, but also illustrates that adults can be impacted at concentrations as low as 4 mu g l(-1) Sigma PAH(50). The majority of studies exploring DWH oil toxicity in fish are performed using acute exposures (1-2 days), mid-range test temperatures (26-28 degrees C) and measure effects at the molecular to organismal levels, leaving a pressing need for more long-term exposures, exposures at the upper and lower levels of GoM relevant temperatures, and studies investigating population level impacts.",,,,,,,,,65,1,0,0,62,1,76,,,1532-0456,1878-1659,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USAUniv Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Dept Marine Sci, Port Aransas, TX USAUniv North Texas, Dept Biol Sci, Denton, TX USA",,,,2019-10-01,WOS:000484870500011,31202903,,,,

However, these may be difficult to obtain for mobile species, especially colonial central-place foragers (CCPFs; e.g., bats, corvids, social insects), because it is often impractical to determine the provenance of individuals observed beyond breeding sites. Moreover, some CCPFs, especially in the marine realm (e.g., pinnipeds, turtles, and seabirds) are difficult to observe because they range tens to ten thousands of kilometers from their colonies. It is hypothesized that the distribution of CCPFs depends largely on habitat availability and intraspecific competition. Modeling these effects may therefore allow distributions to be estimated from samples of individual spatial usage. Such data can be obtained for an increasing number of species using tracking technology. However, techniques for estimating population-level distributions using the telemetry data are poorly developed. This is of concern because many marine CCPFs, such as seabirds, are threatened by anthropogenic activities. Here, we aim to estimate the distribution at sea of four seabird species, foraging from approximately 5,500 breeding sites in Britain and Ireland. To do so, we GPS-tracked a sample of 230 European Shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis, 464 Black-legged Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla, 178 Common Murres Uria aalge, and 281 Razorbills Alca torda from 13, 20, 12, and 14 colonies, respectively. Using Poisson point process habitat use models, we show that distribution at sea is dependent on (1) density-dependent competition among sympatric conspecifics (all species) and parapatric conspecifics (Kittiwakes and Murres); (2) habitat accessibility and coastal geometry, such that birds travel further from colonies with limited access to the sea; and (3) regional habitat availability. Using these models, we predict space use by birds from unobserved colonies and thereby map the distribution at sea of each species at both the colony and regional level. Space use by all four species' British breeding populations is concentrated in the coastal waters of Scotland, highlighting the need for robust conservation measures in this area. The techniques we present are applicable to any CCPF.",,,,,,,,,78,1,0,0,67,0,86,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"RSPB, Ctr Conservat Sci, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, EnglandUniv Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Graham Kerr Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, ScotlandRSPB Scotland, RSPB Ctr Conservat Sci, Etive House,Beechwood Pk, Inverness IV2 3BW, ScotlandBirdWatch Ireland, 20D Bullford Business Campus, Kilcoole, County Wicklow, IrelandCtr Ecol & Hydrol, Bush Estate, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Nicholson Bldg,Brownlow St, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, EnglandUniv Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford Nav Grp, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, EnglandJoint Nat Conservat Comm, Inverdee House,Baxter St, Aberdeen AB11 9QAUNI, ScotlandPlymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, EnglandUniv Roehampton, Life Sci Dept, Whitelands Coll, London SW15 4JD, EnglandUniv Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Falmouth TR10 9EZ, England",BirdWatch IrelandJoint Nat Conservat Comm,,,2017-10-01,WOS:000412080200007,28653410,,,,

The experimental panels were fixed on iron structure frames which were connected to the buoy and its mooring system immersed in water at different depths, and retrieved after 4, 8 and 12 months of exposure. Fouling organisms colonizing the buoys and their mooring systems were sampled after 8 and 12 months of deployment. A total of 86 species was collected and identified at these two stations and the fouling community showed a typical oceanic characteristics. Most of the species were mainly found in the top 50 m depth and a striking vertical zonation of species was also observed with depth. The distance from offshore is a major factor in determining the fouling community composition. In terms of biomass, the fouling community was dominated by pedunculate barnacles, hydroids, and algae, followed by common oysters, pearl oysters and acorn barnacles. Biomass of hard fouling organisms increased over time.

The flexible nature of VLFS makes the response hydroelastic and it is important to have a reduced response of VLFS. The term hydroelasticity refers to the action of hydrodynamic excitation over elastic body limits. The present study tries to examine the combined effect of horizontal loads of wind turbine tower along with the vertical hydrodynamic loads which question the stability of the performance of VLFS. This would lead to better understanding of the hydroelastic response of integrated wind farm-VLFS configuration. To examine the effect of relevant parameters on the VLFS hydrodynamic responses, motion amplitude transfer functions (RAO) for a wide range of wave frequencies are computed.Pontoon type VLFS are giant platforms resting on the sea surface, which are modeled by very large plates according to the Mindlin thick plate theory. The boundary integral element method (BIEM) is used to solve for the velocity potential using Laplace equation providing suitable boundary conditions. The fluid model is based on linear wave hypothesis. The effect of wind on wind turbines which are located at the edges and corner of the VLFS is investigated in the model. The Kaimal wind spectrum is used to generate time series of wind speed incident on the blades of the turbine and loads are computed using blade element momentum theory as in wind simulator FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence).The finite element framework is used to develop the model and to find the hydrodynamic loading. Mooring line connections are used to reduce structural instability. In order to reduce the hydroelastic response of VLFS, connection with hinges or semi rigid line connections are observed to be effective. The elastic and dynamic effects of the combined wind-wave loading over the integrated VLFS are being considered. The hydroelastic effects of mooring lines will not be accounted for.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5772-4,,,,,,,,,"Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Ocean Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",,,,2017-12-20,WOS:000417225100020,,,,,

Offshore wind power has existed for some time in Europe, in the USA, its development has been hampered by opponents of the Cape Wind project off of Massachusetts. At present, the developer of the proposed Cape Wind project and a second developer proposing a project off of Delaware each strive to erect the first offshore wind power project in the Americas. Here, we examine public opinion. We first provide background on the case studies, then a review of prior studies of support and opposition of wind power projects in order to place the mail surveys within the context of the wider literature. After detailing the methods employed, we analyse the results and provide insights into the similarities and dis-similarities that are revealed in the data, with the intent of gaining a broader understanding of how individuals think about offshore wind power. The strikingly higher public support for offshore wind development in the mid-Atlantic, and especially off Delaware, suggests the possibility of substantially higher US public acceptance of offshore wind power than previously anticipated. Moreover, when offshore wind power is seen as transformative, we find substantial support even for residents near the first developments-residents who thus inherently take more risk. Potentially increasing acceptance of wind power, we argue, portends the shape of things to come.

However, the ecological impacts which may result when large arrays of these devices are deployed are unknown. This uncertainty is placing a considerable burden on developers who must collect biological data through baseline and post-deployment monitoring programs under the Environmental Impact Assessment process. Regulators and other stakeholders are often particularly concerned about impacts on marine vertebrates (fish, seabirds and mammals) because many of these receptors are of high conservation and public concern. Unfortunately monitoring for most marine vertebrates is challenging and expensive, especially in the energetic waters where tidal-stream MREDs will be deployed. Surveys for marine vertebrates often have low statistical power and so are likely to fail to detect all but substantial changes in abundance. Furthermore, many marine vertebrate species have large geographical ranges so that even if local changes in abundance are detected, they cannot usually be related to the wider populations. Much of the monitoring currently being undertaken at tidal-stream MRED development sites is thus leading to a 'data-rich but information-poor' (DRIP) situation. Such an approach adds to development costs whilst contributing little to wider ecosystembased understanding. In the present article we discuss the issues surrounding the impacts of tidal-stream MREDs on marine vertebrates and address the questions regulators, developers and other stakeholders need to consider when agreeing monitoring programs for these receptors.",,,,,,,,,29,1,0,0,14,0,32,,,1364-0321,,,,,,,,,,,"Scottish Marine Inst, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, ScotlandUniv Highlands & Isl, North Highland Coll, Environm Res Inst, Ctr Energy & Environm, Ormlie Rd, Thurso KW14 7EE, Scotland",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000417078200024,,,,,

Unlike city lights or lights from offshore gas platforms, whose locations remain stationary from one night to the next, lights from ships typically are ephemeral. Fishing boat lights are most prevalent near coastal cities and along the thermal gradients in the open ocean. Maritime commercial ships also operate lights that can be detected from space. Such observations have been made in a limited way via U.S. Department of Defense satellites since the late 1960s. However, the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite, which carries a new Day/Night Band (DNB) radiometer, offers a vastly improved ability for users to observe commercial shipping in remote areas such as the Arctic. Owing to S-NPP's polar orbit and the DNB's wide swath (similar to 3040 km), the same location in Polar Regions can be observed for several successive passes via overlapping swaths-offering a limited ability to track ship motion. Here, we demonstrate the DNB's improved ability to monitor ships from space. Imagery from the DNB is compared with the heritage low-light sensor, the Operational Linescan System (OLS) on board the Defense Meteorological Support Program (DMSP) satellites, and is evaluated in the context of tracking individual ships in the Polar Regions under both moonlit and moonless conditions.

We quantified the level of vessel activity from vessel traffic data spanning 2011 to 2015. Overlapping these data layers, we identified regions where high vessel activity posed the highest risk to these species. Navy Board Inlet, Eclipse Sound, Frobisher Bay, Hudson Strait and the northern Labrador Shelf were consistently identified as areas of highest risk to multiple species of seabirds in summer and autumn. These waters not only encompass important summer foraging areas near colonies and post-breeding/migratory habitat but are also frequently navigated by vessels servicing busy communities. The level of vessel activity we found for the study area is relatively low compared to waters where many Arctic species overwinter (e.g., Thick-billed Murres off Newfoundland and Labrador). However, identifying current high-risk areas in Arctic waters is important for the conservation and management of Arctic seabirds as industrial and commercial development in this region expands and leads to higher levels of vessel activity.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,8,0,11,,,0964-5691,1873-524X,,,,,,,,,,"Acadia Univ, Dept Biol, Wolfville, NS B4P 2R6, CanadaEnvironm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, 45 Alderney Dr, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 2N6, CanadaCarleton Univ, Wildlife Res Div, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Raven Rd, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, CanadaUniv Washington, Canada Fulbright Chair Arctic Studies, Box 353650, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,,,2018-10-03,WOS:000444793600032,,,,,

Over three mornings, 287 height observations were collected for targets matching murrelet speed, flight height and density on radar. Mean height above ground level was 246 (SE 4.7) m. The lowest murrelet-type target detected was at 62 in, while the highest was recorded at 663 m. Fifty percent of murrelet-type targets were detected between 196 m and 286 m. A maximum-likelihood model of flight heights estimated that 4.6% of murrelets were flying at or below the average wind turbine rotor-swept height of 130.5 m as the birds transited to and from nest sites. From the same model, it was estimated that 0.5% and 0.01% of birds, respectively, were flying at or below the heights of typical communication towers and transmission lines. These data comprise three days of sampling at a single location, and thus may not be representative of height distributions found in other sites or regions. Flight heights likely vary with topography, distance from the ocean, weather, and other factors, and thus the proportion of birds flying below turbine height likely varies both spatially and temporally. Additional data on murrelet flight heights are now being collected to determine how the relative risk of collision changes with topography and weather conditions. This information should help predict the risk of collision with artificial structures, including wind energy developments that may pose a risk to murrelets.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,6,0,7,,,1018-3337,2074-1235,,,,,,,,,,"Hamer Environm LP, POB 2561, Mt Vernon, WA 98273 USA",,,,2011-01-01,BCI:BCI201100673157,,,,,

A moderate abundance (175) of sub-adult red emperor (Luyanus sebae), a fisheryindicator species, were observed along the pipeline. Eleven different categories of marine growth habitat were observed, with the pipeline possessing quite uniform coverage of encrusting marine growth (coralline algae, bryozoans, ascidians, etc.) with patchy occurrences of more structurally complex sponges and black/octocoral forms. Fish species richness and abundance of the commercially targeted Moses' snapper (Luyanus russellii) were correlated positively with increasing cover of sponges. The pipeline itself had very few spans and was never more than fractionally buried. Despite the somewhat homogenous habitats, depths, and position of the pipeline relative to the seafloor, presence of a field joint indent had a positive influence on the abundance of some common and commercially important fish species. This study demonstrates the ecological value of ROV footage obtained during industry inspection operations that were conducted for reasons unrelated to the determination of ecological information. The pipeline offers a corridor of hard bottom habitat within a marine park that facilitates epibiotic growth and the presence of reef-associated species in a region characterised by sandy sediments.

We collected plankton samples at three sites of the lagoon's inlet area every 3 h during four 24 h cycles in mid austral summer. For each early-life history stage (eggs, yolk sac, preflexion larvae, postflexion larvae and early juveniles), the relationship between the abundance and possible combinations of the time of sampling, the wind effect, the wave period and the tidal state was evaluated by fitting generalized linear mix-effects models (GLMM). The wind effects depending on the time of sampling mainly affected fish abundance in all developmental stages. Overall, the highest abundances were collected at nocturnal hours when low-speed offshore winds blew. In addition, higher abundances of eggs, yolk sac and preflexion larvae were related to the incoming flood tide; whereas higher abundances of postflexion larvae and early juveniles were related to longer wave periods. We argued that the daily variation in the abundance of early-life history stages of fishes is related to the sea-land breeze cycle. Therefore, a conceptual framework of the recruitment process of eggs, larvae and early juveniles of fishes into this estuarine system considering the daily effect of winds is proposed.

New ocean energy industries target renewable energy sources thus, on a grand scale, partly mitigating climate change. However, on-site environmental impacts are yet to be established. In this review we compare ocean energy industries with a wide range of conventional, better understood, human activities and outline environmental risks and research priorities. Results show that ocean energy systems are thought to incur many pressures, some familiar and others with yet unknown effects. Particular uncertainties regard ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) and large fast-moving turbines.

The global demand for seafood is continuing to rise sharply, driven by both population growth and increased per capita consumption, whilst wild-capture fisheries are constrained in their potential to produce more seafood. A recently funded EC project, the Blue Growth Farm BGF (GA n. 774426, 1 June 2018 - 30th September 2021) aims at contributing to this world need with an original solution. The Blue Growth Farm proposes an efficient, cost-competitive and environmentally friendly multi -purpose offshore farm concept. It is based on a modular floating structure, moored to the seabed, meeting requirements of efficiency, cost-competitiveness and environmental friendless, where automated aquaculture and renewable energy production systems are integrated and engineered for profitable applications in the open sea. In the present paper, the overall engineering approach developed to carry out the research work is presented, described and justified. Different technical and scientific challenges are addressed through an integrated industrial engineering design approach, where all disciplines are tuned to achieve the Blue Growth Farm main targets. These are represented by: i) guaranteeing expected nominal fish production thanks to advanced automation and remote control capabilities; ii) minimizing the pollution introduced at marine ecosystem level when exploiting the marine natural resources, whilst increasing the social acceptance and users community agreement; iii) maximizing the electricity production in the Blue Growth Farm potential installation area ecosystem to provide energy supply to the on-board electrical equipment and to dispatch the extra produced electric energy to the land network. Preliminary engineering design results are promising to demonstrate effective increase of safety and efficiency by reducing on-board human effort and consequently risks at offshore, thus to make commercial-scale open ocean farming a reality.The present paper introduces overall concepts and design methodology whilst other companion works submitted at OMAE2019 [4], [5], [6] provide insight of specific aspects of the Blue Growth Farm project elaborated during the first six months activity.",,,,,"38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)","JUN 09-14, 2019JUN 09-14, 2019","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine EngnASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn","Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLANDUniv Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLAND",8,0,0,0,1,0,8,,,2153-4772,,978-0-7918-5883-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-03,WOS:000513102300023,,,,,

Endpoints associated with oxidative stress, hepatic total glutathione (tGSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and reduced glutathione (rGSH) significantly increased as mean dose of oil increased, while the rGSH:GSSG ratio showed a non-significant negative trend with oil dose. A significant increase in 3-methyl histidine was found in oil exposed birds when compared to controls indicative of muscle wastage and may have been associated with the gross observation of diminished structural integrity in cardiac tissue. Consistent with previous oil dosing studies in birds, significant changes in liver, spleen, and kidney weight when normalized to body weight were observed. These studies indicate that mortality in response to oil dosing is relatively common and the mortality exhibited by the gulls is consistent with previous studies examining oil toxicity.

A laboratory was built to monitor the vertical structure, time and directional variability of winds in the transitional region between the ocean and the continent. A meteorological station provided pressure, temperature, wind and humidity data. Prevailing winds tend to blow from the NE along the coastline, strongly influenced by the South Atlantic Subtropical High Pressure center. Sea and land breezes had significant amplitude. The offshore wind component (sea breeze) was generally active from 11:00 to 20:00 h; the onshore component (land breeze) from 22:00 to 09:00 h. Weak vertical shear and increasing wind speeds were typically observed in the early afternoon, while stronger shear and the highest wind speeds tend to occur in the late afternoon. Winds profiles from the ocean sector were usually more intense and less sheared. The average power of wind turbines was estimated. The local resource is nearly 2.5 times greater than that of a site located 9.3 km inland. The use of coastal laboratories was demonstrated to be a cost-saving solution for long-term monitoring of the country's wind resources.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-04-23,DRCI:DATA2021076021468034,,,,,

Sand sources have traditionally been sought offshore in the marine environment, but there are problems associated with setbacks from oil and gas infrastructure, presence of muddy overburden, and limited reserves of beach-quality sediments. Fluvial sand sources in channel and point-bar deposits become an attractive alternative for barrier island restoration because of large volumes of relict deposits and because active sand waves are renewable.

Climate change may speed this change. This will mean profound impacts on low-lying coastal areas over the next 50 years, particularly along the eastern coast of England.These physical changes in the coastal zone will occur alongside, and interact with. a variety of human impacts and drivers of change. Agricultural policy reform, and changes in production in response to this and to climate change, will alter coastal landscapes as well as sediment and nutrient inputs into coastal waters. Demographic change - an increasing UK population, who are on average older and who potentially have more leisure time - will be likely to bring about an increased demand for the recreational opportunities that the coast provides. This will mean more demand for land for housing and recreational facilities. A continuing trend of rising income levels may also fuel further demand for imported goods and hence the need for further port development, particularly in the south east of England. Coastal landscapes are also likely to be heavily impacted by the construction of renewable energy infrastructure, i.e. offshore wind farms and wave and tidal power projects.

In this sense, the offshore renewable energy sector has experienced major growth rates. In Portugal, new projects on fixed foundations have now started to arise, as the EDP's full scale demonstration GBF wind turbine, DEMOGRAVI3 project. Innovative concepts as the XL monopiles are also considered as viable alternatives. ORACLE contributes towards a risk-based decision framework to assess the feasibility of fixed foundations for offshore wind turbines and the implications of the foundation's design in the investment needed for commercial scale projects, in the Portuguese renewable energy sector.The global industry and scientific community is aiming at new ambitious goals and trends, towards the minimization of risks and costs, in a context of long-term useful life cycles, i.e. lifetime extension. The lifetime extension increases the potential incoming of renewable power, contributing to the financial viability of the total investment.The foundations have a considerable impact in the safety levels and costs. Because of the severe offshore environment, scour phenomena occurs and is a major source of design uncertainty and cause of foundation's collapse. ORACLE's main goal is to provide a Decision Support System to perform risk analysis and to optimise scour protections, in the context of lifetime extension and climate change effects.ORACLE acts on three strategic contributions:i)","Physical modelling validation of novel concepts for scour protections, i.e. dynamic top layers and wide-graded single layer;ii)",risk-based design methodology for offshore scour protections;iii),"implementation of an open access decision support system to perform risk analysis of the foundation and the scour protection.The risk analysis decision support system aims to set the basis for cost and risk reduction in the offshore wind turbines. Moreover, it will provide an estimate of the optimisation's impact in the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE). This project is developed for two lifetime extension scenarios, also framed within the importance of climate changes to extreme events in marine environment.- Risk analysis of new foundations designed for a large life cycle;- Risk analysis of existing foundations, considered for full or partial repowering.ORACLE project combines expertise in offshore, ocean and coastal engineering, developing innovative research in close contact with recognised consultants of the sector to ensure that the scientific results match the market's needs.The open access perspective of ORACLE, with a world-wide dissemination of a user-friendly decision support system, developed for researchers, professionals and stakeholders, is a step forward to add value in a sector typically surrounded by confidential policies.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,PTDC/ECI-EGC/32170/2017,,,,,,,,Universidade do Porto,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15425666,,

The first involves hydrate heating as warm fluids from deeper conventional reservoirs ascend to the ocean floor through uninsulated pipes intersecting the FIBS. The second case describes system response during gas production from a hydrate deposit. and the third involves mechanical loading caused by the weight of structures placed oil the ocean floor overlying the FIBS.For the analysis of the geomechanical stability of FIBS, we developed and used a numerical simulator that integrates a commercial geomechanical simulator and a simulator describing the Coupled processes Of fluid flow, heat transport. and thermodynamic behavior in the FIBS. Our simulation results indicate that the stability of HBS in the vicinity of warm pipes may be affected significantly.

Our aim was to investigate the horizontal and vertical distribution of migrating storks, and how the dynamics of these distributions was influenced by the weather conditions. We demonstrated that the migration route of White Storks in the study area extends up to 70 km inland from the coast. The most intensive was the migration in the early afternoon, during the last 10 days of August and under north-coming winds. The majority of storks was flying above 400 m and the altitude of flight was influenced by the air temperatures and the day hour. The main driver for the flight distance from the sea was the wind direction. Considering the potential negative cumulative effects due to the high concentration of wind parks in northeastern Bulgaria, we emphasise that the prospective intentions for construction of wind farms, even located at 70 km from the coast, should be subjected to careful studies on the soaring bird migration through the area.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,0324-0770,,,,,,,,,,,"Bulgarian Soc Protect Birds BirdLife Bulgaria, Plovdiv 4000, BulgariaBulgarian Soc Protect Birds BirdLife Bulgaria, Sofia 1111, Bulgaria",Bulgarian Soc Protect Birds BirdLife BulgariaBulgarian Soc Protect Birds BirdLife Bulgaria,,,2014-08-12,WOS:000338601300020,,,,,

It has notable advantages in abundant wind resources, good engineering geological conditions, and powerful capacity for a regional power grid, convenient ports and inland water transport, and low probability of meteorological disaster. The offshore Three Green Gorges, which supply the Yangtze River Delta with green energy and power for its sustainable development, comprise an extended wind power industry system as follows: wind power generation, wind turbine research, development and manufacturing, non-coal, high-energy-consumption wind power industries, including the salt chemical industry, metallurgical industry, intensive processing industry of metals and non-metallic materials, and leisure tourism of offshore wind power. Their installed capacity of wind power will theoretically reach 60 million kW in the short term and 120 million kW in the long term. Their wind power generation will add up to 142 billion kWh per year in the short term and 284 billion kWh per year in the long term, 1.7 times and 3.4 times that of the Three Gorges hydropower project respectively. In addition, the wind power generation in the short term will reduce the usage of 53.96 million tons of standard coal, 12 thousand acres of land, 7.1 million tons of fine dust, 142 million tons of carbonic acid gas, 0.71 million tons of nitrogen oxide and 1.136 million tons of sulfur dioxides each year. In the last of this paper, some proposals have been put forward for achievement of the construction goals and spatial layout project. Firstly, more attention should be paid to the wind resources evaluation in the radial sandbank area and to the integration with the extended wind power industries in the Yangtze River Delta. Second, the offshore wind power mainly adopts an on-grid pattern, supplemented by an off-grid pattern.

Development pressure has been a catalyst for marine spatial planning (MSP) to identify suitable areas for OWED. However, integrating complex ecological information to guide OWED siting remains a substantial challenge. We developed spatial distribution models of marine birds from aerial surveys that we conducted from 2010 to 2012 throughout a 3800 km(2) area off the coast of Rhode Island. For seven groups of marine birds, we constructed either a density surface model or a presence-absence model that incorporated relevant environmental covariates. We integrated our spatial models, along with uncertainty, using spatial conservation prioritization (SCP) software. This identified sites with high marine bird conservation priority that aided evaluation of proposed OWED sites. We found that shallow nearshore waters had the highest conservation priority overall, but we also detected key offshore areas of high priority. Hypothetical OWEDs placed in conservation priority areas significantly reduced the overall distribution of focal species. Currently proposed OWED sites are located in areas of relatively low conservation priority and so would not substantially reduce the overall distribution of marine birds. This SCP approach when combined with quantitative models of bird distribution given relevant environmental covariates provides a robust framework that satisfies the principles of ecosystem-based MSP. Thus, this combined SCP-distribution modeling framework should be extremely helpful to decision makers as they evaluate proposed siting locations of OWEDs in the context of a dynamic marine system.

Oil biodegradation was assessed on the basis of changes in oil composition monitored by GC-MS. Changes in the bacterial community structure were detected by two 16S rRNA gene based culture-independent methods, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone library. The results suggested that crude oil was rapidly degraded during the 30-day bioremediation period. Bacteria affiliated with the genus Pseudomonas dominated all three clone libraries. But dramatic changes were also detected in the process of biodegradation of crude oil. The professional hydrocarbonocastic bacteria (e.g., Alcanivorax) became abundant in the two samples during the bioremediation period.

The North Sea is an area where many stakeholders claim space, which might set boundaries to the number of sites available for mussel culture. Competing claims are a potential source of conflict but may also lead to mutual benefits when smart combinations are sought, e.g. with wind parks, fisheries and nature conservation; especially, the possibility of combining mussel culture in or around wind parks is worthwhile to be further explored. A spatial distribution model adapted for the Dutch North Sea conditions demonstrated that offshore mussel production in wind farms can be profitable.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Fish Spas: the importance of turbulence on stress levels of fish in dynamic environments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 08 2019,2019,"The coastal marine environment is becoming ever more populated by the placement of infrastructure from industries including oil and gas and more recently the renewable energy sector including wind, wave and tidal energy devices. There are currently >4000 offshore wind turbines in Europe that have a monopile for a foundation (87%). For fish, these structures create new habitat, but the structures also change the hydrodynamic environment by introducing wake turbulence downstream of the structure. Fish are known to exploit small scale vortex structures at scales relevant to fish size. However, evidence suggests that fish also exploit wakes at much larger turbulence scales such as in the lee of a marine renewable device where vortex scales are significantly larger than fish length. These results suggest that fish respond as a direct result of physical changes in the environment at a range of scales. What is less clear is how changes in hydrodynamics translates to the physiological response in fish, primarily the stress response. Hydrodynamics is a fundamental process in the marine environment and there is little information of how changes in flow environments (current speed or oscillatory flow) and associated changes in turbulence influence physiological processes of fish. The question therefore arises, does turbulence act as a fish 'spa'? The hypothesis is that turbulence diffuses the forces associated with flow velocity to act as a refuge behind marine renewable structures, especially in high flow environments allowing fish to exploit these environments. With the future addition of thousands of new structures into the marine environment, it is essential that the mechanism behind behavior changes is fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this project seeks to understand the importance of hydrodynamics on the stress response of marine fish using both controlled laboratory experimental and field based approaches.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2280714,,,,,,,,Queen's University of Belfast,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15319396,,,,,

Here at the Besh Barmag bottleneck in Azerbaijan an estimated 1.24-1.51 million migrants passed through in autumn 2011 and a further 0.65-0.82 million in spring 2012, elevating this bottleneck to international importance. Furthermore, 34 bird species were observed in numbers in excess of the 1% threshold of world or flyway population in at least one of the observation seasons. Due to the high concentration of these species, any dangers affecting this passage can be threatening at a population scale. This study therefore aims to describe the migratory behaviour of these 34 species and subsequently to identify the dangers involved in passage through the area. Collision with anthropogenic obstacles was regarded as the main threat in the coastal plain. Ten (40%) of the species studied and observed in autumn 2011 were flying at the lowest altitudes and are therefore under threat on migration through the bottleneck due to overhead power lines, buildings, traffic and hunting. Planned infrastructural developments with heights of up to 200 m (e.g. towers, wind farms) pose a future threat for an additional 13 (52%) of the study species observed in autumn, making a total of 23 species that would be threatened. Only two species, Pygmy Cormorant Microcarbo pygmaeus and Grey Heron Ardea cinerea, can be expected to maintain their currently safe passage in future as they migrate mainly above 200 m above ground level. In spring 2012, all 14 (100%) of the species that used the coastal plain as flyway, migrated below 50 m and are therefore imminently threatened by collision. Although birds migrating over the Caspian Sea were concentrated at the lower altitudes, there was no identifiable threat for migrants using this flyway, but hazards can be expected in the oil production areas further south.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0959-2709,1474-0001,,,,,,,,,,"Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Museum & Inst Zool, Vogelwarte Hiddensee, Soldmannstr 23, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany",,,,2016-06-01,WOS:000376297400010,,,,,

In this marine environment, the structures are exposed to particularly aggressive corrosion and colonized by marine organisms involving a diversity of species. In this paper, a number of cases are conducted where an existing fixed platform is subjected to uniform corrosion. Furthermore, the platform is also subjected to marine fouling. The platform is assessed to investigate the effects of corrosion and marine fouling on its structural strength by determining the Reserve Strength Ratio (RSR) value. It is found the platform is limited to at least 50 years of service life when subjected to average corrosion. However, the platform is no longer considered as safe after 37 years when subjected to severe corrosion. Moreover, there is an RSR loss of 38% when marine fouling is introduced at the first 5 years which is detrimental to the overall safety of the platform. On the other hand, there is minimum RSR loss of only 5% for most cases when marine fouling is introduced but still detrimental to the overall safety of the platform. The obtained outcomes were documented and will be useful information to conduct condition assessment (or structural health monitoring) of aged fixed jacket structures.

It holds important populations of wintering waders including purple sandpiper, turnstone, ringed plover and bar-tailed godwit. The waders on Sanday have been periodically surveyed since 1982. In November 2012 the waders using the SPA were re-surveyed. There were three objectives to this work: 1. To undertake co-ordinated wader surveys (repeat counts of the relevant wader survey sections) to inform Site Condition Monitoring. 2. To record general observations of wader movements during the day in relation to existing domestic scale wind turbines on Sanday. Note - the wind turbines being considered are domestic scale generally associated with individual farms and dwellings. 3. To recommend a future monitoring strategy for waders using East Sanday Coast SPA. Main findings Wader Counts A total of 7,279 waders of 17 species were counted within the SPA boundary in late November 2012; The counts were lower than the previous surveys for purple sandpiper, turnstone, ringed plover and sanderling; Bar-tailed godwit counts were higher than previous surveys; and Differences in the timing of the count from previous surveys may account for the observed changes. General Observations of waders General observations of waders revealed that most species used the farmland; Curlew, golden plover, lapwing, snipe and redshank used farmland more frequently than other birds; and The narrower sections of the islands were often used as crossing points for waders moving from one beach to another. Recommendations for future monitoring of waders using East Sanday Coast SPA At least three counts should be undertaken using existing count boundaries and methodologies in the late winter; Each total count should be undertaken over as short a period as possible to minimise double counting; Long count sections and a team of observers should be used; Consideration should be given to undertaking spring and autumn passage counts; To further our understanding of how waders use farmland on Sanday, structured monitoring should be undertaken. This monitoring should ideally include observing how waders use farmland during the different stages of the tide and day and night; and Studies on the food availability may help to inform our understanding of wader distributions on Sanday.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1759-4014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15311071220,,,,,

Therefore, this work presents a parametric study of two important parameters, namely the mooring line angle and line pretension, for a taut mooring configuration focusing on the dynamic response when applied to the TetraSpar floating foundation compared to a catenary mooring system. The work is based on experimental results conducted in the wave basin at Aalborg University (AAU) and compared to analytical stiffness calculations. In addition, a numerical model was tuned based on the main dynamics to achieve the tension response. The results showed satisfying dynamic behavior where the angle and pretension mainly influenced the surge and yaw natural periods.

Three workshops were carried out in order to obtain the fishermen's view; participatory mapping was employed to get an understanding of their fishing areas and of oil activities, as well as of the tensions between them and the others. Spatial injustice is evident in the active exclusion of fishermen from the space surrounding oil platforms, as well as in the passive exclusion due to contamination, insecurity, and even more, bleak perspectives for the future. The article shows that these exclusions began with an acceptable arrangement for the inclusion of fishermen, which, nevertheless, led to their exclusion in order to increase extraction, given the exhaustion of Mexico's public oil extraction system. Highlights: Research article on fishing exclusion in Mexico in order to favor oil platforms. Fishermen perceive: 1) active but not effective exclusion (legal and policing), and 2) passive exclusion (contamination, lack of security and fishing resources), which are evidence of spatial injustice.

On the other hand, some environmental features do provide more predictable foraging habitats. Successful foragers presumably use both consistent and flexible strategies. However, our understanding of this balance is limited, because simultaneous high-resolution measurements of prey and predator distributions are rarely available. We used a marine radar to map flocks of common terns Sterna hirundo and roseate terns S. dougallii near their breeding colony on Great Gull Island, New York, USA, in 2014 and 2015. We also surveyed the terns' prey, and tidal currents, using acoustic instruments on small boats. Feeding flocks formed most often in areas where water accelerated over shallow topography. These locations were consistent from one tidal cycle to the next, although flocks did not always form there. A spatial generalized linear model for flock density explained 45% of the deviance in their observed distribution. The mean prey density was not significantly different under flocks than elsewhere, and there were no detectable spatial trends in the prey field. Our results show that terns rely on the physical action of tidal currents to make prey available near the surface, and that the spatial and temporal predictability of this process may be more important to them than the absolute density of the prey. These findings quantify important features of tern foraging habitat, and may prove useful for planning human activities (e.g. offshore wind energy facilities) to reduce their impacts on terns.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,11,0,12,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 239 Montauk Hwy, Southampton, NY 11968 USAMonterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, 7700 Sandholdt Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000428817200016,,,,,

They are the last dense, extensive structures of these ecosystems found in the north-west Indian Ocean. Growing industrial activities near the Nayband Bay and the consequent marine pollution has resulted in damage and threatened different marine habitats in recent years. To date, a comprehensive description of the microbial life in the mangrove ecosystem that has been exposed to oil contamination is lacking. This information could significantly contribute to a better overview of the function and resilience of the ecosystem. This work represents a first effort to better understand the Nayband Bay mangrove microbiology by applying 16S rRNA metagenomics. A total of 65,408 readings from the V3-V4 16S rRNA gene regions were obtained from 24 sediment samples, each measuring 440 bp. Most sequences belonged to members of the Proteobacteria phylum (mainly {gamma}-Proteobacteria); however, members of the Bacteroidetes phylum (mainly Flavobacteriia) were also well represented in the samples. We discovered that the community of this ecosystem strongly exhibit typical structures of oil-contaminated marine environments. This is likely due to the growing industrial activity in the area and its consequent marine polluting effects.

This is due to the low Reynolds number (Re) resulting from low wind speeds and small rotor size. The use of specially designed low Re airfoils permits start up at lower wind speeds, increasing the startup torque and thus improving the overall performance of the turbine. A new airfoil was designed and the performance of a 2-bladed rotor designed for low Re application fitted to an Air-X marine 400 W wind turbine was tested at a wind speed range of 3-6 m/s. The low Re rotor incorporated taper and twist to the low Re AF300 airfoil section. The pitch of the blades was varied over a range of 15 degrees, 18 degrees and 20 degrees to study the performance and the startup wind speed. It was found that the turbine performed best at 18 degrees pitch angle. On an average, the wind turbine yielded a power coefficient (C-P) of 0.255 at a height of 8.22 m at a wind speed of 6 m/s at 18 degrees pitch angle. Maximum C-P based on 10 s data at the freestream velocity of 6 m/s was 0.291. The cut-in wind speed based on 10 s averaged data at the optimum pitch angle was 3.24 m/s whereas the instantaneous cut-in wind speed was 2.34 m/s.

We here hypothesize that this linkage is partly due to the direct effect of temperature on larval and juvenile growth. Secondly, temperature acts as a proxy for both biotic and abiotic factors influencing recruitment. Indices of abundance of early juvenile cod (2-3 months old), O-group cod (4-5 months old) and 3-year old cod are analysed in more detail against the environmental temperature, wind stress components, wind-induced turbulent energy and the spawning stock biomass. To deal with autocorrelation, non-stationarity and non-normality, which complicate a statistical time series analysis, randomization and Box-Jenkins methods are applied. In addition to the important effect of high sea temperature during the early life stage in forming strong year classes, the results show that the spawning stock biomass is nearly as important. Also, alongshore southerly wind stress anomalies during the period of pelagic drift (from April through summer) and offshore wind stress anomalies during egg and early larval stages (in April) act favourably on recruitment. The beneficial effect of southerly wind anomalies could be linked partly to high temperature, but the flux of zooplankton-rich water from the Norwegian Sea into the feeding areas of the Barents Sea may also be increased. The favourable influence of offshore winds in April is less predominant and causal links are also less clear; possible explanations for this might be increased offshore spreading of eggs and early larvae, resulting in reduced risk of predation, and increased compensation inflow of intermediate Norwegian Sea water which, in this restricted period of time, has a high concentration of spawning copepods suitable as prey for the developing cod larvae.",,,,,,,,,90,0,1,0,45,0,97,,,1054-6006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1995-12-01,WOS:A1995TM92100002,,,,,

A microbial platform will produce ethanol from seaweed at a cost significantly lower than the cost of ethanol from corn or Brazilian sugar cane and will produce 80% less greenhouse gases than transportation fuels derived from petroleum. This Phase I project will leverage unique expertise in computational enzyme design and synthetic biology to develop a yeast-based platform that will reduce the costs of fermentation and achieve commercial viability. A yeast-based platform will improve the titer and productivity of ethanol production, while demonstrating the commercial viability of ethanol production from seaweed. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the domestic production of renewable energy such as biofuels while reducing the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that threaten our climate and environment. To date, domestic biofuels have not been cost-competitive with petroleum, due to a lack of low-cost, scalable sugar sources that do not compete with growing food. Ideal for biofuel production, seaweed is an abundant, scalable, low-cost biomass that actually benefits the environment. Aquafarmed seaweed reduces ocean acidity and eutrophication, while reducing carbon dioxide in the environment. Unlike terrestrial biomass, seaweed does not compete with food crops for land or water use and requires no fertilizer. A yeast system for the fermentation of seaweed will be used by oil and gas companies to produce low-carbon-footprint biofuels near US coastal populations and key oil and gas infrastructure. More than 3 billion gallons of ethanol can be produced domestically from seaweed.

However, despite their wide application there are potential biases, mainly due to imperfect detectability and the behavioral responses of fish to the observers.Methods: The performance of two methods of UVSs were compared to test whether they give similar results in terms of fish population density, occupancy, species richness, and community composition. Distance sampling (line transects) and plot sampling (strip transects) were conducted at 31 rocky reef sites in the Aegean Sea (Greece) using SCUBA diving.Results: Line transects generated significantly higher values of occupancy, species richness, and total fish density compared to strip transects. For most species, density estimates differed significantly between the two sampling methods. For secretive species and species avoiding the observers, the line transect method yielded higher estimates, as it accounted for imperfect detectability and utilized a larger survey area compared to the strip transect method. On the other hand, large-scale spatial patterns of species composition were similar for both methods.Discussion: Overall, both methods presented a number of advantages and limitations, which should be considered in survey design. Line transects appear to be more suitable for surveying secretive species, while strip transects should be preferred at high fish densities and for species of high mobility.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,8,0,15,,,2167-8359,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Miami, FL 33143 USAAegean Univ, Dept Environm, Mitilini, GreeceAegean Univ, Dept Marine Sci, Mitilini, Greece",,,,2018-07-04,WOS:000435832400008,29942703,,,,

Energy-rich reduced substrates, namely hydrocarbons, support accelerated biogeochemical dynamics, creating unique geobiological habitats. Subseafloor geology dictates the surficial expression of seeps, generating hydrocarbon (gas and/or oil) seeps, brine seeps, and mud volcanoes. Biogeochemical processes across the redox spectrum are amplified at hydrocarbon seeps due to the abundance and diversity of reductant; anaerobic metabolism dominates within the sediment column since oxygen is consumed rapidly near the sediment surface. Microbial activity is constrained by electron acceptor availability, with rapid recycling required to support observed rates of hydrocarbon consumption. Geobiologic structures, from gas hydrate to solid asphalt to authigenic minerals, form as a result of hydrocarbon and associated fluid discharge. Animal-microbial associations and symbioses thrive at hydrocarbon seeps, generating diverse and dense deep sea oases that provide nutrition to mobile predators.Hydrocarbon seeps are abundant deep sea oases that support immense biodiversity and where specialization and adaptation create extraordinary lifestyles.Subseafloor geology shapes and defines the geochemical nature of fluid seepage and regulates the flux regime, which dictate the surface expression.High rates of anaerobic oxidation of methane require coupling to multiple processes and promote diversity in the anaerobic methanotroph microbial community.The recent discovery of novel phyla possessing hydrocarbon oxidation potential signals that aspects of seep biogeochemistry and geobiology remain to be discovered.",,,,,,,,,49,2,0,0,25,0,55,,,0084-6597,1545-4495,978-0-8243-2048-5,,,,,,,,,"Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA",,,,2021-02-19,WOS:000613951000010,,,,,

We examined activity levels and behavioral patterns of red snapper over natural reefs, oil platforms and submerged ships. Telemetry tags (Sonotronics model Am) that transmitted tri-axial acceleration range, with average depth or average temperature were developed specifically to monitor red snapper and tested in captive fish. Wild red snapper were surgically implanted at depth and monitored for 16 months over artificial and natural reefs. Overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) as the sum of x, y and z acceleration range (0-0.398 g along each axis) was used to estimate activity levels of red snapper at each reef. Measurements of red snapper indicated that season, diel period, temperature time blocks and reef type had significant effects on ODBA and depth use. Red snapper were more active during the summer, at night, and during a period of rapid temperature increase. Red snapper were also generally more active and stayed at shallower depths on ships. The increases in activity reported here may be attributed to differing feeding or spawning behaviors on certain reefs. These results suggest that environmental factors such as temperature and diel period heavily influence red snapper and that they behave differently on specific habitat types at certain times. Future efforts to examine the ecological performance of red snapper across reef types should therefore carefully take environmental influences into account.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,0,7,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Sch Earth Environm & Marine Sci, Brownsville, TX USA",,,,2019-09-30,WOS:000484877400007,,,,,

For seabed habitats and seabirds, the elicited values mainly represent non-use values for changes in the condition of natural capital assets. For maritime cultural heritage the valuation refers to the changed provision of this cultural ecosystem service.

To effectively address this issue, we develop a decision-making procedure, that facilitates the distribution of disputed areas of specific size among heterogeneous players in a transparent and ethical way, while considering coalitional formations through coexistence. To do this, we model players' alternative strategies and payoffs within a cooperative game-theoretic framework. Depending on whether transferable utility (TU) or non-transferable utility (NTU) is the more appropriate assumption, we illustrate the use of the TU Shapley value and the Lejano's fixed point NTU Shapley value to solve for the ideal allocations. The applicability and effectiveness of the process has been tested in a case study area, the Dogger Bank Special Area of Conservation in the North Sea, which involves three totally or partially conflicting activities, i.e. fishing, nature conservation and wind farm development. The findings demonstrate that the process is capable of providing a unique, fair and equitable division of space Finally, among the two solution concepts proposed the fixed point NTU Shapley value manages to better address the heterogeneity of the players and thus to provide a more socially acceptable allocation that favours the weaker player, while demonstrating the importance of the monetary valuation attributed by each use to the area.

It is thus very important to check in which offshore region of the Polish coast the littlest consequences of the OWE construction may be expected. The area of 9000 km(2) in the central part of the Polish economic zone was selected for sediments sampling. In total, sediments from 46 stations were collected by gravity twin corer or geo-vibro corer. Heavy metal (Hg, Pb, Cd, As, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Fe, Mn) concentrations were measured by AAS and ICP-MS while (137) Cs activity concentrations were measured by gamma spectrometer. Sediment accumulation rates were quantified by Pb-210 geochronology at 7 stations to follow the history of contaminants accumulation. Study areas located between isobaths of 20 m and 40 m were characterized by the lowest concentration of heavy metals, often below natural environmental background (e.g. Pb = 6.7 - 11.4 mu g. g(-1), As = 0.3 - 8.4 mu g.g(-1)). The largest contamination by heavy metals (e.g. Pb reached 86.1 mu g.g(-1) while As = 21.0 mu g.g(-1)) was visible at the outer part of Bornholm Basin and in Slupsk Furrow, the deepest studied regions. Highest accumulation of heavy metals in this area is connected to large fraction of pelite sediments and large proportion of organic matter at those stations. It may be concluded that shallow sandy sediments of the Southern Baltic are unpolluted and appropriate for OWE construction. Deeper sea regions e.g Slupsk Furrow and Bornholm Basin may be regarded as moderately polluted and therefore not recommended for OWE acquisition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, due to the unplanned nature of catastrophes, studies aimed to identify the effects of these accidents on an ecosystem and its inhabitants often have imperfect study designs that are reactive rather than proactive, resulting in methodological and analytical challenges. On 20 April 2010, following an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, a well blowout occurred on the seafloor approximately 80 km off the Louisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico. This blowout resulted in the largest marine oil spill in United States history, which impacted critical migratory stopover and overwintering habitat for many seabird and shorebird species, including species of high conservation concern such as the piping plover (Charadrius melodus). Here, we assessed the potential longer-term demographic impacts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on piping plovers in a capture-mark-recapture framework. We examined whether a series of demographic processes, including probabilities of remaining at a specific wintering site, over-winter and annual apparent survival, winter stopover duration, and abundance varied among oiled and unoiled habitats. We found that the perceived amount of oiling on land, in water, and on individual birds, as well as numerous demographic processes, were spatially or temporally variable. However, we found little support that piping plover demography was negatively influenced by the magnitude of oil observed at an impacted area, or that demographic rates substantially varied between reference and oil impacted areas. Nor did we find that piping plovers that were observed to be oiled had lower survival probabilities following the DWH oil spill relative to non-oiled individuals from the same winter population.

Individual design and installation steps are represented with bottom-up engineering models that compute times and costs associated with the process; furthermore, operational constraints are assigned to each process so that delays caused by weather and presence of marine mammals may be accounted for in the overall project timeline. The model structure, assumptions, inputs, and results are vetted with industry partners and compared against actual projects for validation. Installation times show reasonable agreement with real data. Project cost sensitivities are investigated to compute the system-level impact of different design choices. First, individual vessel efficiencies are computed for varying numbers of installation vessels and weather time series to show the diminishing returns of more than two feeder barges. Then, array cable capital costs and installation times are determined for a representative project with different turbine sizes. These values quantify the cost-benefit tradeoffs and show a net-cost savings of decreasing numbers of turbines, increased turbine spacing, and fewer turbine terminations.

Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) considers human activities at sea in a more integrated way by analysing and designating spatial and temporal distributions of human activities based on ecological, economic and social targets. However, specific tools supporting spatial decisions at sea incorporating all relevant sectors are rarely adopted. The decision support tool Marxan is traditionally used for systematic selection and designation of nature protection and conservation areas. In this study, Marxan was applied as a support tool to identify suitable sites for offshore wind power in the pilot area Pomeranian Bight / Arkona Basin in the western Baltic Sea. The software was successfully tested and scenarios were developed that support the sites indicated in existing national plans, but also show options for alternative developments of offshore wind power in the Pomeranian Bight / Arkona Basin area.

The main characteristics of the platform are its monolithic configuration and the use of concrete as main material. The monolithic nature allows avoiding joints between the substructure and the tower increasing the service life of the structure. The use of concrete increases the resistance when exposed to an offshore environment but requires ensuring a full compression state along the structure to avoid cracking. Thus, the platform is post-tensioned by longitudinal tendons along its length.Adequate fatigue design is a key factor to ensure the reliability of offshore structures. Floating Offshore Wind Turbines are subjected to cyclic phenomena coming from waves, wind, rotor-induced vibrations and structural vibrations. These loads have to be considered in order to assess the fatigue life of offshore structures. Furthermore, pre-stressed concrete adds an internal load such that it avoids the presence of tension stresses at any given section, which has a positive influence on the fatigue response of the structure by increasing its fatigue resistance. An excess of compression can, however, also induce an adverse effect on the fatigue resistance of the concrete.In order to study the fatigue behaviour of WindCrete when fitted with a 5MW Wind Turbine, a Fatigue Limit State verification is performed according to the DNVGL-ST-0437 for load cases definition and FIB Model Code (2010) for fatigue structural verification. The location chosen to install WindCrete is the Gulf de Lion, at the west of the Mediteranian Sea off the coast of Catalunya with a mean wind speed above 9 m/s. The metocean conditions for design purpose are presented, which are obtained from available environmental data.A total of 458 simulation cases are performed using the NREL FAST software assuming wind and wave co-directionally, and quasi-static mooring response for Parked and Power-Production operational modes. Assuming an elastic response of the tower, the internal stresses at the tower base are obtained for all the simulations. Then, a fatigue analysis is performed at the tower base through a cumulative damage approach based on the Palmgren-Miner rule. The analysis accounted for the multiaxial stresses produced by the combination of axial, bending and tangential forces. The S-N material curves were defined according to the Model Code 2010 method, which accounts for the effect of the stress range as well as the average stress.",,,,,2nd ASME International Offshore Wind Technical Conference (IOWTC 2019)2nd ASME International Offshore Wind Technical Conference (IOWTC 2019),"NOV 03-06, 2019NOV 03-06, 2019",,"St Julian's, MALTASt Julian's, MALTA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5935-3,,,,,,,,,"Univ Politecn Catalunya BarcelonaTech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Barcelona, Spain",,,,2020-04-17,WOS:000518042400013,,,,,

We surveyed upland and lowland blanket bog lakes, across both sedimentary (sandstone) and igneous (granite) geologies, to compare baseline physico-chemical and biological conditions for blanket bog lakes in western Ireland. A comprehensive data set of water chemistry, Chydoridae, littoral macroinvertebrates and aquatic macrophyte taxa were collected from all lakes over a twelve-month period beginning in March 2009. The main difference in lake hydrochemistry was that the lowland lakes, situated at lower altitude and in closer proximity to the coast than the upland lakes, had significantly higher conductivity and major ion (sodium [Na], chloride [Cl], magnesium [Mg], potassium [K] and sulphate [SO4]) concentrations because of the greater influence of atmospheric (sea spray) deposition. The upland lakes were also significantly cooler and had higher concentrations of total phosphorus (TP). Differences were also evident between the upland and lowland lakes in the chydorid, littoral macroinvertebrate and macrophyte communities, primarily caused by marine-driven hydrochemical variation and differences in benthic substrate. The chemical effect of marine deposition appeared to have a much greater impact on lake hydrochemistry and biology than either underlying geology or altitude. This is the first study of its kind to be carried out on blanket bog lakes in Ireland. More information is needed on the biology of such lakes, together with research on anthropogenic drivers of biotic communities, if significant loss of biodiversity associated with agriculture, peat extraction, burning, wind farm developments and conifer afforestation is to be prevented.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,,,0791-7945,2009-003X,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Distillery Fields, Cork, Ireland",,,,2013-09-04,WOS:000322694200008,,,,,

GFA2 and GFA3 were spore forming and similar to the Desulfotomaculum strains T90A and T93B previously isolated from North Sea oil field waters by a classical enrichment procedure. Western blots (immunoblots) of whole cells showed that GFA2, GFA3, T90A, and T93B are different serotypes of the same Desulfotomaculum species. Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against T. mobile type strain cells were produced and used as capture agents on IMB. These MAb, named A4F4, were immunoglobulin M; they were specific to T. mobile and directed against lipopolysaccharides. The prevailing cells immunocaptured with MAb A4F4 were morphologically and serologically similar to T. mobile type strain cells. T. mobile was not detected in these oil field waters by classical enrichment procedures. Furthermore, extraction with antibody-coated IMB allowed pure strains to be isolated directly from primary enrichment cultures without prior time-consuming subculturing and consecutive transfers to selective media.",,,,,,,,,67,0,0,0,14,2,69,,,0099-2240,,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV BERGEN,DEPT MICROBIOL & PLANT PHYSIOL,JAHNEBAKKEN 5,N-5007 BERGEN,NORWAY",,,,1992-04-01,WOS:A1992HM12100026,16348693,,,,

A time-series of samples of the calanoid copepod Clausocalanus furcatus was collected from a petroleum platform in the northern Gulf of Mexico every 12 h for similar to 2 to 3 wk in March-April and May-June 2003. Egg and nauplii (stages I and II) abundances were estimated from 30 l Niskin water bottle samples, and abundances of later stages were estimated from vertical net tows. An inverse parameter estimation technique based on a stage-based matrix population model and a search procedure using the sequential quadratic programming algorithm was applied to estimate stage-specific mortality rates. Simulation experiments were conducted to test the robustness of this technique. When the technique was applied to simulated data with different levels of variability, introduced by lognormal error terms, the technique performed well at low to medium level of variability (coefficient of variation < 0.5). We then applied this technique to field data in periods when the depth of the pycnocline was similar (i.e. advection was likely similar). The estimated stage-specific mortality rates showed similar patterns across stages in March-April and May-June, with mortality rates being highest for eggs, lower for early nauplii stages, lower still for late nauplii stages, lowest for early copepodite stages, and high again for late copepodite stages. We compare our estimated rates to those reported in the literature and conclude with a discussion of the importance of advancing estimation methods to deal with advection and a recommended approach for applying mortality estimation methods to zooplankton in dynamic environments.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,10,0,14,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Solomons, MD 20657 USA",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000289489800012,,,,,

By comparison to other forms of electric power generation, offshore wind energy is generally considered to have relatively benign effects on the marine environment. However, offshore projects include platforms, turbines, cables, substations, grids, interconnection and shipping, dredging and associated construction activity. The Operation & Maintenance (O&M) activities include the transport of employees by vessel or helicopter and occasional hardware retrofits. Therefore, various impacts are incurred in the construction, operation and decommissioning phases; mainly the underwater noise and the impacts on the fauna. Based on the fact that in many of the aforementioned issues there are still serious environmental uncertainties, contradictive views and emerging research, the present work intents to provide a thorough literature review on the environmental and social impacts of offshore wind energy projects in comparison with the onshore counterparts.

Results regarding floating platform motions are then interpolated for the whole set of data using radial basis functions (RBF).Tower inclination and hub acceleration are selected as relevant operating parameters. When one of them exceeds its safety threshold, the machine is supposed to be stopped. If no stops are considered, the capacity factor is 39%, while imposing more restrictive tolerances results in a non-linear decrease of the energy yield.This approach can be helpful in determining a good tradeoff between energy production and reliable operation, bridging the design and operational phases of the project.",,,,,"34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015","Amer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivAmer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","St John's, CANADASt John's, CANADA",2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,,,978-0-7918-5657-4,,,,,,,,,"Univ Cantabria, Santander, Cantabria, Spain",,,,2016-09-02,WOS:000379793600056,,,,,

Mooring systems and umbilicals belong to the family of slender bodies which are components sensitive to bio-colonisation because of a change of dynamic behaviour due to shape, roughness and mass modifications. However, this stochastic process in time and space is hard to predict. The purpose is then twofold: first, to provide a stochastic spatial model of the bio-colonisation on a mooring line; second, to show that in some defined environmental conditions, such as low wave height, low wind and current velocities, the monitoring of mooring lines tension can help to assess and reduce uncertainty on this model. Therefore, a comprehensive stochastic modelling based on mussels colonisation was carried out using on-site videotapes, experimental campaigns and expert knowledge. We studied the efficiency of a virtual sensing network using this model and a conditional entropy metric. It is first shown that the spatial model fits well with experimental data, and second that a denser medium accuracy sensor network is to be preferred to a single high accuracy fairlead sensor to reduce the uncertainty on the model parameters.

Digital aerial surveys of birds in marine areas are one such example of passive observation and they are increasingly being used to quantify the abundance and distribution of marine birds to inform impact assessments for proposed offshore wind developments. However, the uncertainty in species identification presents a major hurdle to determining the abundance and distribution of individual species. Using a novel analytical approach, we combined data from two surveys in the same area: aerial digital imagery that identified only 23% of individuals to species level and boat survey records that identified 95% of individuals to species level. The data sets were analysed to estimate the effects of environmental covariates on species density and to produce species-specific estimates of population size. For each digital aerial observation without certain species identification, randomized species assignments were generated using the observed species proportions from the boat surveys. For each species, we modelled several random realizations of species assignments and produced a density surface from the ensemble of models. The uncertainty from each stage of the process was propagated, so that final confidence limits accounted for all sources of uncertainty, including species identification. In the breeding season, several species had higher densities near colonies and this pattern was clearest for three auk species. Sandeel density was an important predictor of the density of several gull species.Synthesis and applications. This method shows it is possible to construct maps of species density in situations in which ecological observations cannot be identified to species level with certainty. The increasing use of passive detection methods is providing many more data sets with uncertain species identification and this method could be used with these data to produce species-specific abundance estimates. We discuss the advantages of this approach for estimating the abundance and distribution of birds in marine areas, particularly for quantifying the impacts of offshore renewable developments by making the estimates derived from the older digital surveys more comparable to the recently improved surveys.This method shows it is possible to construct maps of species density in situations in which ecological observations cannot be identified to species level with certainty.

Eight removal and control quadrats were marked along eight vertical profiles in each fringe and sampled bimonthly by a photo-quadrat method. In the Inferior Eulittoral fringe, in both treatments, Ulva fasciata and Perna perna were initially predominant and replaced by Phragmatopoma lapidosa in the sixth month. In this successional period, the species presence prior to the disturbance effect reinforced the similarity of .75% between treatments. In the Superior Eulittoral fringe, Chthamalus spp. predominated throughout all the months and bare space represented up to 30%. In the removal treatment the substrate remained 75% empty until the sixth month, mainly occupied by Collisella subrugosa.

In the 1986-1989 census, both species ranked in the top three as measured by catch per unit effort(CPUE). Catch per unit effort of both species was much higher during 1986-1989 than in 1975-1978. The increased catches in the 1980s were likely due to increased abundance, rather than changes in targeting by vessel operators. Sites with highest CPUE for kelp bass contained high relief, both with and without kelp. The highest CPUE occurred at several oil platforms offSanta Barbara. Most of the best fishing sites were located in the northern part of the Southern California Eight, probably because fishing pressure is lower there than to the south. Kelp bass fishing was best in late spring and early fall; catches decreased during the peak of the spawning period. Highest catches of barred sand bass occurred over low relief or sandy bottoms where spawning aggregations occurred. Catch per unit effort was highest during the summer spawning period. Kelp bass were most commonly taken from <30 m. Barred sand bass were most abundant in 10-50 m.

One constructability issue related to driving heavy pipe piles is the pile running. The term pile running refers to the quick penetration of a pile into the seabed as a result of its high self-weight and low resistance from the seabed. The unexpected pile running can cause the steel wire of the hammer to break or even the loss of the hammer. A case study of pile running at an oil platform is introduced in this paper. A simplified theoretical method is proposed to explain the mechanisms of the pile running in this case. A factor of friction degradation is proposed to calculate the dynamic skin friction from the static ultimate skin friction of surrounding soil.

We find that levels of both negative mental and physical health were significantly more pronounced at baseline compared to later time points. We show that greater community attachment is linked to lower levels of negative health impacts in the wake of the oil spill and that the disaster had a uniquely negative impact on households involved in the fishing industry. Further, we find evidence that the relationship between community attachment and mental health is more pronounced at later points in time, and that the negative health impacts on fishers have worsened overtime, Implications for research and policy are discussed.

Anthropogenic pressures on marine ecosystems and organisms are steadily increasing. Whether and to what extent these pressures influence marine genetic biodiversity is only starting to be revealed. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we analysed the microbial community structure of 33 individuals of the habitat-forming glass spongeVazella pourtalesii, as well as reference seawater, sediment, and biofilm samples. We assessed how two anthropogenic impacts, i.e. habitat destruction by trawling and artificial substrate provision (moorings made of composite plastic), correspond with in situV. pourtalesiimicrobiome variability. In addition, we evaluated the role of two bottom fishery closures in preserving sponge-associated microbial diversity on the Scotian Shelf, Canada. Our results illustrate thatV. pourtalesiisponges collected from protected sites within fishery closures contained distinct and taxonomically largely novel microbial communities. At the trawled site we recorded significant quantitative differences in distinct microbial phyla, such as a reduction in Nitrospinae in the four sponges from this site and the environmental references. Individuals ofV. pourtalesiigrowing on the mooring were significantly enriched in Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia and Cyanobacteria in comparison to sponge individuals growing on the natural seabed. Due to a concomitant enrichment of these taxa in the mooring biofilm, we propose that biofilms on artificial substrates may 'prime' sponge-associated microbial communities when small sponges settle on such substrates. These observations likely have relevant management implications when considering the increase of artificial substrates in the marine environment, e.g., marine litter, off-shore wind parks, and petroleum platforms.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,8,0,9,,,1566-0621,1572-9737,,,,,,,,,,"GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, GermanyBedford Inst Oceanog, Dept Fisheries & Oceans, Dartmouth, NS, CanadaDalhousie Univ, Ocean Tracking Network, Halifax, NS, CanadaChristian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",,,,2020-08-24,WOS:000562340600001,,,,,

Collections of occupied and unoccupied colonies from two common species, Junceella juncea and Dichotella gemmacea, were used to determine the influence of host size and structure oil B. amplus. Comparisons of occupied and unoccupied colonies found that the former were generally taller than the latter. Occupancy was dependent on colony height, which may increase the effectiveness of the host as a habitat and a refuge from predation. Although B. amplus did not display any preferences for any of the host species examined, D. gemmacea tended to have more gobies than did J juncea. This may be due to the structural difference between the unbranched, J. juncea and the multiple-branching, D. gemmacea, thus hinting at the influence of habitat structure on the goby Population. The results also indicate that goby size was limited by colony width on J. juncea, which may be from the way B. amplus hides behind it so as to avoid detection by predators.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Univ Singapore, Trop Marine Sci Inst, 18 Kent Ridge Rd, Singapore",,,,2009-12-30,ZOOREC:ZOOR14608051877,,,,,

However, their ecosystem function is threatened by direct anthropogenic disturbance and climate change. Oil sands surface mining in the boreal regions of Western Canada denudes tracts of land of organic materials, leaves large areas in need of reclamation, and generates considerable quantities of extraction process-affected materials. Knowledge and validation of reclamation techniques that lead to self-sustaining wetlands has lagged behind development of protocols for reclaiming terrestrial systems. It is important to know whether wetlands reclaimed with oil sands process materials can be restored to levels equivalent to their original ecosystem function. We approached this question by assessing carbon flows and food web structure in naturally formed and oil sands-affected wetlands constructed in 1970-2004 in the postmining landscape. We evaluated whether a prescribed reclamation strategy, involving organic matter amendment, accelerated reclaimed wetland development, leading to wetlands that were more similar to their natural marsh counterparts than wetlands that were not supplemented with organic matter. We measured compartment standing stocks for bacterioplankton, microbial biofilm, macrophytes, detritus, and zoobenthos; concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and residual naphthenic acids; and microbial production, gas fluxes, and aquatic-terrestrial exports (i.e., aquatic insect emergence). The total biomass of several biotic compartments differed significantly between oil sands and reference wetlands. Submerged macrophyte biomass, macroinvertebrate trophic diversity, and predator biomass and richness were lower in oil sands-affected wetlands than in reference wetlands. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that wetland age and wetland amendment with peat-mineral mix mitigate effects of oil sands waste materials on the fully aquatic biota. Although high variability was observed within most compartments, our data show that 20-year-old wetlands containing oil sands material have not yet reached the same level of function as their reference counterparts.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,11,0,17,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Windsor, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, CanadaSuncor Energy Inc, Edmonton, AB T2P 3E3, CanadaUniv Waterloo, Dept Biol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, CanadaUniv Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, CanadaUniv Saskatchewan, Toxicol Ctr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B3, CanadaUniv Calgary, Ecosyst & Publ Hlth Dept, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada",Suncor Energy Inc,,,2013-08-07,WOS:000321489100007,23967574,,,,

Based on VV-Ocean, we establish a sea-land integration platform which can reproduce drifting and diffusion processes of oil spilling from sea bottom to surface. Environment factors such as ocean current and wind field have been considered in this simulation. On this platform oil spilling process can be abstracted as movements of abundant oil particles. The result shows that oil particles blend with water well and the platform meets the requirement for real-time and interactive rendering.

Often, an overly positive picture of the costs and benefits of seaweed production is sketched.

Sensitivity analysis shows that revenues would have to increase by roughly 300%, all other things equal, to make a profit. A number of opportunities to improve the economic feasibility of a North Sea seaweed value chain are identified.

Common larval fishes did not differ in number between northern and southern inlets that provide access between Chincoteague Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, but did differ among years and between seasons. Wind angle and offshore water temperature were predictive of ingress for some species, but patterns were not strong. Canonical correspondence analyses of ichthyoplankton assemblage data indicated that ingress was better predicted by season and year rather than specific environmental variables (e.g. offshore water temperature, moon phase, wind angle). Seasonal patterns in larval fish ingress were consistent with those from other coastal lagoon networks along the eastern USA seaboard.

The results showed that the ecological quality of most areas in the study indicated by M-AMBI was from moderate to bad status with the worse status in the coastal areas, especially around the estuaries, harbors and outfalls, and better status in the offshore areas except the area close to oil platforms or disposal sites. Despite large variations in nature of the input data, all variations of M-AMBI gave similar spatial and temporal distribution patterns of the ecological status within the bay, and showed high correlation between them. The agreement of new ecological status obtained from all M-AMBI variations, which were calculated according to linear regression, was almost perfect. The benthic quality, assessed using different input data, could be related to human pressures in the bay, such as water discharges, land reclamation, dredged sediment and drilling cuts disposal sites. It seems that M-BAMBI were more effective than M-NABMI (M-AMBI calculated using abundance data) in indicating human pressures of the Bay.

These fossil fuels have finite reserves and will run out in the future. The negative effect of these fossil fuels is that they produce pollutant gases when they are burned in the process to generate electricity. Fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source. However, renewable energy resources (solar, wind, hydro, biomass, geothermal and ocean) are constantly replaced, hence will not run out, and are usually less polluting. Due to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions more attention is being given to renewable energy. As wind is a renewable energy it is a clean and abundant resource that can produce electricity with virtually no pollutant gas emission. Induction generators are widely used for wind powered electric generation, especially in remote and isolated areas, because they do not need an external power supply to produce the excitation magnetic field. Furthermore, induction generators have more advantages such as cost, reduced maintenance, rugged and simple construction, bnishless rotor (squirrel cage) and so on. This paper presents the detailed survey on performance of wind farms situated at Jamgodrani hills and Nagda hill, near Dewas city in Madhya Pradesh, India. Variation of various performance indices such as total yearly generation, total availability of grid, total availability of wind generator, total generating units per wind generator and capacity utilization factor is discussed for wind farm on Jamgodrani hills and Nagda hill respectively. Latter, it introduces a simple and direct formula based on complex impedance matrix method to calculate the minimum excitation capacitance (C-min) and corresponding maximum frequency (f(max))required for successful voltage build up across the terminal of three phase dual winding induction generator when operating on 225kW rating, used as wind generator in wind farm and variation of minimum excitation capacitance as well as corresponding maximum frequency is also being plotted for various conditions of load and speed.

Besides climatic conditions, the deployment of wind energy is limited by technical, social, economic, and environmental factors. Typically, assessments of land availability for wind power use legal and technical criteria to estimate the potential for wind power expansion. In contrast, we use observed characteristics of wind power generation sites existing in Austria and Denmark to estimate its potential expansion in Czechia. We combined data on wind turbine locations with data on land use, wind speeds, human impact on land, and nature conservation areas. Results Our analysis shows that the density of wind power in Austria is variable, but higher on average (4.79 MW km(-2)) than in Denmark (1.76 MW km(-2)). Austrian wind turbines have been installed in areas where the human impact on land is mostly higher than the Austrian average, while in Denmark, no difference is observed. Regarding the land use composite, the share of agricultural land on sites with wind turbines is on average much higher (86%), while the share of forest is much lower (7%) in both countries. We identified a maximum potential area in Czechia of 543 km(2) with Austrian and 421 km(2) with Danish characteristics. When conservatively assuming observed historical power densities, this area translates to 2295 MW and 741 MW of installed wind power capacity, respectively. These results are a magnitude of order lower than the potentials found in existing studies. In a sensitivity analysis, we have examined that the availability of potential sites depends mainly on the population density, the human impact on land, prevailing wind speeds, and the height above sea level. Conclusions We estimated available land area for potential wind turbine installations in Czechia using our newly developed methodology based on observed site characteristics of today's wind power infrastructure in Austria and Denmark. Available land area indicated possible overestimation of wind power capacities proposed in the recent studies on the renewable energy transition. Hence, more rigorous consideration of land availability is required for assessments of potential wind power expansion.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,0,13,,,2192-0567,,,,,,,,,,,"German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Engn Thermodynam, Dept Energy Syst Anal, Stuttgart, GermanyUniv Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Dev, Vienna, Austria",,,,2020-02-17,WOS:000511683100001,31894197,,,,

In this study we evaluate straight line constant velocity protocols, the accuracy and precision of estimates of transect length from ultra short baseline acoustic tracking and compare measurements of transect width based on sonar and lasers. When ROV tracking was compared to distances measured on sonar maps, the difference between linear tracked and mapped distance (ILDt-LDml) averaged 1.7 +/- 0.5 m. The error was not significantly different with distance. Our navigation protocols allowed us to maintain relatively constant heading and speed. Distance computed from velocity exceeded mapped distance by 2-4 m. The error was not significantly different with distance. Measurements of transect width made with lasers and sonar were comparable, particularly when the ROV was within 4 m of the substrate. Based on our data, ROV tracking can be used to measure transect length within 2 m. If tracking fails, distance can be estimated from velocity within 2-4 m. Sonar can be sued to measure transect width with considerable cost savings.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,0025-3324,,,,,,,,,,,"Calif Dept Fish & Game, Ft Bragg, CA 95437 USA",,,,2006-09-01,WOS:000242273600012,,,,,

However, whether these potential impacts represent real ones, such that they cause detectable trends in population levels, remains unknown. Changes in population dynamics of seabirds are driven primarily by rates of reproduction and adult and juvenile survival, all three of which are impacted by foraging success. Therefore, revealing precisely how MREIs can affect seabird foraging success through changes in foraging behaviour is key to understanding whether large-scale installations could have impacts at a population level. Discussion focuses on how to define foraging habitat and how MREIs might impact those habitats and foraging behaviour indirectly by changes in oceanographic processes and prey characteristics. Foraging behaviours are also likely to be more directly impacted by MREIs, so focus here is also on how changes in foraging behaviour during the more constrained breeding season can influence reproductive output by altering individual energy budgets. A third and more-direct potential impact of MREIs on foraging behaviour is changes in diving behaviour. Throughout, relevant gaps in current knowledge that need to be addressed in order to make robust predictions as to how MREIs might impact seabird populations are highlighted.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,17,0,31,,,2213-607X,,978-94-017-8002-5; 978-94-017-8001-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland",,,,2014-12-17,WOS:000344882300007,,,,,

Being installed in a marine ecosystem, the noise generated by these MHK devices may affect the fish and marine mammal well-being. Since this MHK technology is relatively new, much of the design practice follows that from conventional horizontal axis wind turbines.

Most of them are nonindigenous species that tolerate wide fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and even pollution. These sessile suspension feeders have a rapid growth rate, usually a short life span of a few months, reach sexual maturity when only a few weeks old, and produce large numbers of short-lived nonfeeding planktonic larvae. They thrive on marina floats, pilings, buoys, and boat bottoms in protected harbors where there is reduced wave action and enhanced nutrients from anthropogenic activities. Nonindigenous ascidians frequently overgrow oysters and mussels, which are often cultivated in or near busy harbors. Adult ascidians on ship or barge hulls may survive transport over thousands of kilometers to harbors with conditions similar to those they left; occasionally live larvae have also been recovered from ships' ballast water. U.S. Navy dry dock movements between major Pacific ports have transported large masses of fouling nonindigenous taxa, including ascidians. Transfer between culture sites of oysters, mussels, and associated lines and nets may provide an additional mode of transport. Once nonindigenous ascidians become established, they provide large local sources of larvae for further possible invasions into additional harbors and nearby natural marine communities. Invasive species include both solitary and colonial forms, with a preponderance of large solitary species that thrive in highly disturbed habitats. In Guam, for example, most nonindigenous ascidians are confined to harbor structures and have not as yet significantly colonized natural reefs. In contrast, healthy natural benthic regions both inside and outside the harbors of Guam are usually stable coral reef communities containing a high diversity, but very low biomass, of native colonial ascidian species. However, in several areas of the Caribbean a native colonial didemnid has recently begun overgrowing coral reefs. In the Gulf of Mexico a nonindigenous didemnid now covers many offshore oil rigs and may become a threat to neighboring natural reefs. Additional data on nonindigenous ascidians in Australia, Palau, Hawai'i, and the Mediterranean are included. Although serious invasion of coral reefs has not yet been reported, more studies and regular monitoring are needed.",,,,,,,,,110,2,0,0,115,2,134,,,0030-8870,,,,,,,,,,,"12001 11th Avenue NW, Seattle, WA, 98177, USA",,,,2002-07-01,BCI:BCI200200534704,,,,,

Produced water that meets effluent limitations for total oil and grease contains low concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons, low molecular weight organic acids, and several metals. The U.S. EPA has expressed concern that some of these chemicals could be bioaccumulated to potentially toxic concentrations by marine organisms in the receiving waters of offshore produced water discharges. This paper presents the results of an intensive monitoring study to determine if marine animals bioaccumulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from produced water discharges to offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Two platform pairs, each consisting of a produced water-discharging platform and a nearby non-discharging reference platform were selected for monitoring in offshore waters (90 to 260 m depth) of the northern Gulf of Mexico. Produced water, ambient sea water, two species of bivalve mollusks, and several species of fish were collected from each platform pair. Forty PAH analytes, including parent and alkyl PAHs, were analyzed in all samples. The two discharging platforms discharged an average of 1.75 million L/d and 1.13 million L/d of produced water containing 30 to 43 mug/L (ppb) and 24 to 51 mug/L of PAHs, respectively. More than 90 percent of the PAHs were naphthalene and alkylnaphthalenes. The two bivalves, jewel boxes and thorny oysters, collected from legs of the platforms, contained up to 800 ng/g dry wt (ppb) total PAHs in their soft tissues. Muscle tissues of fish collected from the platform pairs contained <1 to 120 ng/g dry wt total PAHs. The dominant PAHs in the bivalve tissues were alkylnaphthalenes, fluorenes, phenanthrenes, and dibenzothiophenes, all characteristic of a petroleum source. A few individual PAHs were present at a significantly higher concentration in tissues of thorny oysters, but not jewel boxes, from one of the produced water-discharging platforms than from the paired reference platform. The relative concentrations of different PAHs in oysters was different than that in the produced water. The evidence for bioaccumulation of PAHs from produced water by shellfish was considered weak and inconclusive, because bioaccumulation of petroleum-derived PAHs was demonstrated in only one instance, and the source(s) of the PAHs was unclear. Concentrations of individual PAHs in fish muscle were low. Higher concentrations of individual PAHs were detected with similar frequency in fish from the reference and discharging platforms. Thus, the fish were not bioaccumulating PAHs from the produced water discharges.

For example, the early life history of fishes inhabiting expansive freshwater systems such as the Great Lakes differs from other freshwater environments but has received less attention. Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, an anadromous species adapted to living exclusively in freshwater, provides an opportunity to evaluate processes regulating growth and survival of a fish with marine origins inhabiting a large freshwater system. We collected age-0 alewives at three distinct locations (nearshore Chicago, nearshore Waukegan, offshore) in southwestern Lake Michigan during 2005 and 2006 to estimate density, growth, and survival. Larval alewife densities were up to three times greater and hatching peaks occurred earlier in 2005 compared to 2006. Back-calculated alewife hatch dates indicated that peak hatch occurred two weeks prior to peak catch rates, with similar hatching distributions of larvae collected between nearshore and offshore environments. Alewives up to approximately 16 d of age were collected in both nearshore locations before appearing in the offshore environment. Alewife growth rates were influenced by zooplankton density, water temperature, and hatching date whereas survival from the nearshore to offshore environment was influenced by wind events and hatching date. Prey availability and passive larval transport driven by offshore wind events are more commonly identified as factors influencing marine rather than freshwater larvae. Thus, factors affecting recruitment dynamics of fishes in large complex inland systems may be more similar to marine than freshwater systems.

Mortality and injuries have been observed in fish exposed to loud impulse sounds, but knowledge on the sound levels at which (sub-)lethal effects occur is limited for juvenile and adult fish, and virtually non-existent for fish eggs and larvae. A device was developed in which fish larvae can be exposed to underwater sound. It consists of a rigid-walled cylindrical chamber driven by an electro-dynamical sound projector. Samples of up to 100 larvae can be exposed simultaneously to a homogeneously distributed sound pressure and particle velocity field. Recorded pile-driving sounds could be reproduced accurately in the frequency range between 50 and 1000 Hz, at zero to peak pressure levels up to 210 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 (zero to peak pressures up to 32 kPa) and single pulse sound exposure levels up to 186 dB re 1 mu Pa(2)s. The device was used to examine lethal effects of sound exposure in common sole (Solea solea) larvae. Different developmental stages were exposed to various levels and durations of pile-driving sound. The highest cumulative sound exposure level applied was 206 dB re 1 mu Pa(2)s, which corresponds to 100 strikes at a distance of 100 m from a typical North Sea pile-driving site. The results showed no statistically significant differences in mortality between exposure and control groups at sound exposure levels which were well above the US interim criteria for non-auditory tissue damage in fish. Although our findings cannot be extrapolated to fish larvae in general, as interspecific differences in vulnerability to sound exposure may occur, they do indicate that previous assumptions and criteria may need to be revised.",,,,,,,,,48,3,0,0,38,0,52,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"IMARES, Ijmuiden, NetherlandsTNO, The Hague, NetherlandsDef Mat Org, The Hague, NetherlandsMinist Infrastruct & Environm DG Water, The Hague, Netherlands",Def Mat OrgMinist Infrastruct & Environm DG Water,,,2012-05-16,WOS:000303198600039,22431996,,,,

The model of sea dynamics is governed by primitive equations that are solved on a grid with an improved resolution of the selected coastal zone-in this case, the Gulf of Finland. The equations of the model are formulated in a bipolar orthogonal coordinate system with an arbitrary arrangement of poles and the sigma coordinate in the vertical direction.

Slamming significantly reduces the design life of floating offshore wind turbines, as well as marine structures, and causes structural damage. Thus, the slamming load should be considered sufficiently during the design phase of the structure, and the results of experiments of good quality should be incorporated. The phenomenon of slamming should be analyzed using peak pressure, width, duration, and dynamic loads that depend on the design and natural frequency of the structure. In the case of a slamming experiment, the deadrise angle shows the greatest pressure between 3 degrees to 10 degrees. In this study, pressure values were compared using a model with a deadrise angle of 10 degrees and a cylinder model most commonly used for the fabrication and installation of offshore structures. The peak pressure of the cylindrical model is greater than those of the flat model and the wedge model with a 10 degrees deadrise angle. Pressure and strain were measured using free drops from heights of 1.0 and 1.7 m from the water surface, and the elastic effects were studied accordingly. Also, the peak pressure due to a slamming impact occurs several times depending on the natural frequency of the structure. In order to understand the behavior of the structure against the elastic effect, the second peak in the experimental results was theoretically and experimentally analyzed. The second pressure peak is greater than the first pressure peak due to the elastic behavior effects based on the natural frequency of models used in the slamming test. Also, a single slamming results in several peak pressures and it greatly deteriorates the fatigue strength. Experiments and simulations were carried out to derive the effects of repeated slamming loads on the structure. In the structural design considering the slamming loads, information on the elastic effect of the structure and accumulated loads is very important. This can be an important variable in the design of the floater and can play an important role in assessing the impact on the floater. These results raise questions as to the extent that slamming pressures are replaced with equivalent hydrostatic pressures in most design rules of the recognized certification society.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,2076-3417,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Ulsan, Sch Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Ulsan 44610, South Korea",,,,2020-04-27,WOS:000525287900310,,,,,

To monitor such spill events, fully polarimetric (Pol-SAR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely used in improving oil spillage detection performance of the image segmentation methods and machine learning methods. A key factor that greatly affects the performance of the existing methods is the use of prior knowledge, such as the manual labels of oil slicks and clean seawater. In some scenarios, a large number of trustworthy manual labels of oil slicks have been accumulated. In other scenarios, however, there are few manual labels. To efficiently utilize the manual labels in various scenarios, we propose an oil spillage identification method, named RampOC. We design cost-sensitive risk minimization model to tackle the problem of imbalance of oil slicks and seawater, employ the ramp loss function to deal with various cases of the manual labels, and design a kernel-based CCCP algorithm to train a classifier by solving a series of convex dual programming. The trained classifier is applicable to various cases, including the normal case that a certain number of the labels of oil slicks are labeled, the case that a large proportion of labels have gone missing or incorrect, and the case that no labels of oil slicks are known. In all of these cases, RampOC has proven to be effective to detect the ocean oil spillage regions.

Larvae are considered to be highly susceptible to offshore transport in productive upwelling regions, thereby increasing dispersal, limiting onshore recruitment, and reducing the intensity of community interactions. We show that 45 species of nearshore crustaceans were not transported far offshore in a recruitment-limited region characterized by strong upwelling. To the contrary, 92% of these larvae remained within 6 km from shore in high densities throughout development along two transects sampled four times during the peak upwelling season. Larvae of most species remained nearshore by remaining below a shallow Ekman layer of seaward-flowing surface waters throughout development. Larvae of other species migrated farther offshore by occurring closer to the surface early in development. Postlarvae evidently returned to nearshore adult habitats either by descending to shoreward-flowing upwelled waters or rising to the sea surface where they can be transported shoreward by wind relaxation events or internal waves. Thus wind-driven offshore transport should not limit recruitment, even in strong upwelling regions, and larvae are more likely to recruit closer to natal populations than is widely believed. This study poses a new challenge to determine the true cause and extent of recruitment limitation for a more diverse array of species along upwelling coasts, and thus to further advance our understanding of the connectivity, dynamics, and structure of coastal populations.",,,,,,,,,154,0,0,0,133,0,179,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USAUniv Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 93510 USA",Univ Calif,,,2009-12-01,WOS:000272700800019,20120816,,,,

The programme has run since 1985 and includes field surveys at drilling sites in different parts of the Dutch sector. One of the locations investigated is the former drilling site F18.9, situated on the Oyster grounds. The (abandoned) location was visited in 1988, 1 y after the exploratory drilling ended. This paper gives a brief overview of the 1988 study at this discharge site, which was investigated again in 1990 as part of the Bremerhaven Workshop. Chemical analyses of the sediment over a transect in the residual current direction revealed a clear gradient in contamination levels, with oil concentrations ranging from 250 to 450 mg kg-1 dry sediment within 250 m and gradually decreasing to < 20 mg kg-1 beyond 750 m. Barium concentrations showed a similar pattern. Subtle biological effects, indicated by the absence of a very sensitive species (Montacuta ferruginosa), were found as far as 2 km from the discharge site. Abundance patterns of 2 other sensitive species (Harpinia antennaria and Callianassa subterranea) suggested environmental stress to occur up to 1 or 2 km. Within 750 m from the discharge site an increasing number of species, including the dominant Amphiura filiformis, appeared to decrease in abundance, successively resulting in a reduced total macrofauna abundance and species richness. Typical opportunistic species were observed more frequently only within a radius of 250 m. An alternative measure of diversity ('relative macrofauna abundance') was introduced and its merits are discussed. It is suggested that a combination should be used of community-based parameters (e.g. species richness, relative abundance) and species-based parameters (e.g. presence of opportunistic species, absence of susceptible species) to describe the impact of pollution. In this way 7 accumulating effects were distinguished.

Our estimate is equal to twice the emission rate from all the on-road vehicle traffic in the county. Our estimated methane emission rate for the Coal Oil Point seeps (80 +/- 12 td(-1)) is 4 times higher than previous estimates. The most intense areas of seepage correspond to structural culminations along anticlinal axes. Seep locations are mostly unchanged from those documented in 1946, 1953, and 1973. An exception is the seepage field that once existed near offshore oil platform Holly. A reduction in seepage within a 1 kin radius around this offshore platform is correlated with reduced reservoir pressure beneath the natural seeps due to oil production. Our findings suggest that global emissions of methane fi om natural marine seepage have been underestimated and may be decreasing because of oil production.",,,,,,,,,245,7,1,0,58,0,277,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Crustal Studies, Dept Geol Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,,1999-09-15,WOS:000083473200015,,,,,

Benthic invertebrate assemblages exposed to oil had significantly fewer individuals of fewer species 1 week after the spill, markedly changing their ecological structure.

Analysis of 72 x 0.1 m(2) Smith-McIntyre grab samples obtained from one pre-drilling and three post-drilling periods yielded a diverse fauna consisting of 196 invertebrate species and 5035 individuals. Changes to benthic community structure were assessed using ANOVA and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS). The abundances of two common species (Apseudes sp. 1 and Prionospio coorilla) decreased significantly at the well-head site immediately after drilling. The size of these reductions in abundance ranged between 71% and 88%, and persisted for less than 4 months after drilling. A third common species (Katlysia sp. 1) increased in abundance 200 m east of the well-head following drilling. Most species occurred at densities too low to be analysed individually and so were pooled at higher taxonomic levels. Changes in the abundance of species aggregated by phylum varied, but significant declines in the most abundant phyla (Crustaceans and Polychaetes) of 45-73% were observed at all sites within a 100 m radius of the well-head following drilling. In most cases these changes became undetectable four months after drilling following species recruitments. MDS ordinations confirm that drilling related changes to benthic community structure are most pronounced at stations located closest to the well-head. Additionally, the ordinations indicate that modified communities persist at the well-head for more than I I months following exploratory drilling. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, fine-scale movements and use of artificial reefs by red snapper over diel periods is unclear. Both manual and passive telemetry were used to examine fine-scale movement patterns and residence time of red snapper around artificial habitats to evaluate the importance of these structures to this species. Red snapper (550-745 mm TL; n = 12) were manually tracked at artificial reefs in the northeastern GOM over 24-h periods. Fish stayed near the artificial reefs (<100 m, with 75% of locations within 30 m of the structure), but were significantly further from the reefs at night (mean = 27.5 m, SD = 7.1) than day (mean = 19.1 m, SD = 8.2). Based on manual tracking, home range and mean distance from the reef increased with fish size. These fish also showed long term residence of 332-958d based on passive acoustic monitoring. The close proximity of these fish to the reef over 24-h periods and the long-term residency provides evidence that these artificial reefs are important habitat for red snapper and should be considered an effective management tool.

In a randomized controlled crossover design, the shift workers received a placebo, melatonin (3 mg, 1 hour before bedtime), or bright light (30-minute exposure, individually scheduled) during the first 4 days on the night shift and during the first 4 days on the day shift. Subjective and objective measures of sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and a simple serial reaction-time test) and sleep (diary and actigraphy) were recorded.Results Subjective measures indicated that melatonin modestly reduced sleepiness at work during the day shift and increased sleep by 15-20 minutes per day. Bright light gave values in between those of melatonin and the placebo, but with few significant results. According to the objective measures, bright light improved sleep to a minor degree during the night shift. Hardly any side-effects were reported.Conclusions Melatonin and bright light modestly improved sleep and sleepiness in this field study. In well-controlled simulated nightwork studies, both melatonin and bright light are more effective in alleviating sleepiness and sleep problems.

An archetypical example is the endangered Florida panther, whose conservation status is intrinsically linked to population size, but for which reliable abundance information is lacking across its range. This is due not only to the inherent difficulty of sampling a rare and elusive species over a large geographic area, but also because of restricted scientific access to private land. Human interactions with wildlife are a regular occurrence, and interactions with non-scientists constitute an important and underutilized source of information about species distribution and abundance. For example, motor vehicle collisions with Florida panthers are recurrent on the vast network of roads within the public and private lands comprising its range in southern Florida, USA. Capitalizing on a tendency for the public to report collisions with species of concern to wildlife officials, we describe a novel methodology using public reports along with routine telemetry monitoring data to produce the first statistically defensible population estimates for the Florida panther across its entire breeding range. In essence, our approach uses traffic volume and road density to estimate the probability of motor vehicle collision mortality from telemetered animals and models counts reported by the public accordingly. Despite low motor vehicle collision mortality probabilities, our methodology achieved abundance estimates of reasonable precision (29% CV) that was similar to that of previous panther studies using conventional approaches on much smaller study areas. While recovery criteria require establishment of three distinct populations of 240 Florida panthers, we found this single population may never have exceeded 150 individuals from 2000 to 2012.Synthesis and applications. By extracting critical demographic information from underutilized aspects of human-wildlife ecology, our citizen-based approach can cost less than conventional alternatives and could conceivably be used for long-term population monitoring of other species over broad geographic areas, for example from reports of avian wind farm collisions, beached whales or marine mammal boat strikes. An additional benefit is that it can be applied to historical data sets of carcass recovery programmes, in our case permitting abundance estimation over a 13-year period.By extracting critical demographic information from underutilized aspects of human-wildlife ecology, our citizen-based approach can cost less than conventional alternatives and could conceivably be used for long-term population monitoring of other species over broad geographic areas, for example from reports of avian wind farm collisions, beached whales or marine mammal boat strikes.

As it is approaching toward deeper water depth, the dynamic response of the large floating wind turbine experiencing various environmental loads becomes more challenge. For examples, as the structural size gets larger, the dynamic interaction between the flexible bodies such as blades, tower and catenary mooring-lines become more profound, and the dynamic behaviors such as structural inertia and hydrodynamic force of the mooring-line get more obvious. In this paper; the dynamic response of a 5MW floating wind turbine undergoing dfflerent ocean waves is examined by our FEM approach in which the dynamic behaviors of the catenary mooring-line are involved and the integrated system including flexible multi-bodies such as blades, tower, spar platform and catenaries can be considered.Firstly, the nonlinear dynamic model of the integrated wind turbine is developed. Different from the traditional static restoring force, the dynamic restoring force is analyzed based on our 3d curved flexible beam approach where the structural curvature changes with its spatial position and the time in terms of vector equations. And, the modified finite element simulation is used to model a flexible and moving catenary of which the hydrodynamic load depending on the mooring-line's motion is considered Then, the nonlinear dynamic governing equations is numerically solved by using Newmark-Beta method.Based on our numerical simulations, the influences of the dynamic behaviors of the catenary mooring-line on its restoring performance are presented. The dynamic responses of the floating wind turbine, e.g. the displacement of the spar and top tower and the dynamic tension of the catenary, undergoing various ocean waves, are examined. The dynamic coupling between different spar motions, i.e. surge and pitch, are discussed too. Our numerical results show: the dynamic behaviors of mooring-line may significantly increase the top tension, particularly, the peak-trough tension gap of snap tension may be more than 9 times larger than the quasi-static result. When the wave frequency is much higher than the system, the dynamic effects of the mooring system will accelerate the decay of transient items of the dynamic response; when the wave frequency and the system frequency are close to each other, the displacement of the spar significantly reduces by around 26%.

This species' feeding behaviour, however, is poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the feeding behaviour of dolphinfish and the effect of body size (and the consequently aggregated learning experience) on the strategies used for capturing their prey. Observations were made from an oil platform in north-eastern Brazil. Dolphinfish length was visually estimated and classified into three size classes. The following foraging strategies were observed in our study: active chasing', leaping out', swimming in circles', surf', using floating objects' and cleaning turtle carapaces'. The most frequently used foraging strategy was active chasing', suggesting a strong preference of dolphinfish in using visual cues during predation. Smaller size-classes of dolphinfish did not perform the swimming in circles' and surf' strategy, probably due to a lack of learning experience, since further social interactions could be needed in order to show this strategy. Smaller dolphinfish regularly showed the using floating objects' as a foraging strategy, probably reflecting an opportunistic behaviour. The smallest individuals were using more simple strategies, to chase smaller prey that could have different and less complex escape strategies. It indicates learning experience could play an important role into the dolphinfish ontogeny, moving towards more complex foraging strategies throughout their lives. Independently of the age class, the dolphinfish displayed a varied repertory of foraging strategies, maximizing hunting success in the open ocean, a hostile pelagic environment with a low prey availability.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,6,1,6,,,0025-3154,1469-7769,,,,,,,,,,"Ciencia & Utilidade Socioambiental Inst ECUS, Inst Educ, Salvador, BA, BrazilUniv Fed Bahia UFBA, Lab Ecol Benton, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Biomonitoramento, Salvador, BA, BrazilUniv Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Ecol & Zool, Lab Biol Teleosteos & Elasmobranquios LABITEL, Florianopolis, SC, BrazilUniv Fed Bahia, Lab Estudos Recifes Corais & Mudancas Globais REC, Salvador, BA, BrazilUniv Fed Alagoas, Unidade Ensino Penedo, Dept Engn Pesca, Penedo, Brazil",Ciencia & Utilidade Socioambiental Inst ECUS,,,2015-08-26,WOS:000358846800022,,,,,

This includes the Leach's storm-petrel Oceanodroma leucorhoa, a species that is declining throughout its Northwest Atlantic breeding range. In 2013 and 2014, we used global location sensors to track foraging movements of incubating storm-petrels from 7 eastern Canadian breeding colonies. We determined and compared the foraging trip and at-sea habitat characteristics, analysed spatial overlap among colonies, and determined whether colony foraging ranges intersected with offshore oil and gas operations. Individuals tracked during the incubation period made 4.0 +/- 1.4 day foraging trips, travelling to highly pelagic waters over and beyond continental slopes which ranged, on average, 400 to 830 km from colonies. Cumulative travel distances ranged from similar to 900 to 2,100 km among colonies. While colony size did not influence foraging trip characteristics or the size of areas used at sea, foraging distances tended to be shorter for individuals breeding at the southern end of the range. Core areas did not overlap considerably among colonies, and individuals from all sites except Kent Island in the Bay of Fundy foraged over waters with median depths > 1,950 m and average chlorophyll a concentrations <= 0.6 mg/m(3). Sea surface temperatures within colony core areas varied considerably (11-23 degrees C), coincident with the birds' use of cold waters of the Labrador Current or warmer waters of the Gulf Stream Current. Offshore oil and gas operations intersected with the foraging ranges of 5 of 7 colonies. Three of these, including Baccalieu Island, Newfoundland, which supports the species' largest population, have experienced substantial declines in the last few decades. Future work should prioritize modelling efforts to incorporate information on relative predation risk at colonies, spatially explicit risks at-sea on the breeding and wintering grounds, effects of climate and marine ecosystem change, as well as lethal and sub-lethal effects of environmental contaminants, to better understand drivers of Leach's storm-petrel populations trends in Atlantic Canada.",,,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,46,0,51,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Mem Univ, Psychol Dept, St John, NF, CanadaAcad Univ, Dept Biol, Wolfville, NS, CanadaKenyon Coll, Biol Dept, Gambier, OH 43022 USAEnvironm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Mt Pearl, NF, CanadaEnvironm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Mt Pearl, NF, CanadaEnvironm & Climate Change Canada, Ecotoxicol & Wildlife Hlth Div, Mt Pearl, NF, CanadaDalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS, CanadaBird Studies Canada, Sackville, NB, CanadaEnvironm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Dartmouth, NS, Canada",Bird Studies Canada,,,2018-06-28,WOS:000431757400005,29742124,,,,

In addition, a detailed comparison with a non-rocking single pile is conducted to examine the effect of pile rocking on soil response more clearly. Finally, the momentary liquefaction depth is investigated and a parametric study on pore pressure response has been carried out. Results indicate that local pressure enlargement occurs near the mudline and the rate of pore pressure decrease in depth is slowed down due to pile rocking, leading to a relatively high pore pressure in the upper soil range.

High fishing pressure may erode the demographic structure of fish stocks, lead to less diverse spawning strategies, and more concentrated distributions of offspring in space and time. Hence an oil spill may potentially hit a larger fraction of a year-class of offspring. Such a link between demographic structure and egg distribution was recently demonstrated for the Northeast Arctic stock of Atlantic cod for years 1959-1993. We here estimate that this variation translates into a two-fold variation in the maximal proportion of cod eggs potentially exposed to a large oil spill.

The replacement of natural, often sedimentary, substrata with hard substrata has altered the distribution of species, particularly non-indigenous species, and can facilitate the assisted migration of native species at risk from climate change. This has been likened to urbanization as a driver of global biotic homogenization in the marine environment the process by which species invasions and extinctions increase the genetic, taxonomic, or functional similarity of communities at local, regional, and global scales. Ecological engineering research showed that small-scale engineering interventions can have a significant positive effect on the biodiversity associated with artificial structures, promoting more diverse and resilient communities on local scales. This knowledge can be applied to the design of multifunctional structures that provide a range of ecosystem services. In coastal regions, hybrid designs can work with nature to combine hard and soft approaches to coastal defence in a more environmentally sensitive manner.

Changes in the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes played an important role in structuring bacterial communities in oil-treated sediments. Proteobacteria were dominant in oil-treated samples, whereas Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were either the second or the third most abundant taxa. Tenericutes, members of which are known for oil biodegradation, were detected shortly after treatment, and continued to increase in DI and PP sediments. Multivariate statistical analyses (ADONIS) revealed significant dissimilarity of bacterial communities between oil-treated and untreated samples and among locations. In addition, a similarity percentage analysis showed the contribution of each species to the contrast between untreated and oil-treated samples. PCR amplification using DNA from pure cultures of Exiguobacterium, Pseudoalteromonas, Halomonas and Dyadobacter, isolated from oil-treated microcosm sediments, produced amplicons similar to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading genes.

They are known to be displaced by various marine industry activities, including construction and operation of offshore wind farms. However, the consequences of displacement for individuals and consequently on the population as a whole are unknown. On 2nd May 2017, seven scientists with particular expertise in red-throated diver ecology and/or the energetic and demographic consequences of displacement for marine birds were invited to a workshop. Using their expertise and knowledge of divers and other marine birds, plus fundamental ecological principles, some generalisations about how red-throated divers might be affected by displacement were sought. This report comprises the main points of discussion and agreement during the workshop. For displacement to cause a population-level change the following needs to occur. Divers need to show a behavioural response to anthropogenic marine structures, leading them to forage in a different area. This needs to cause a change in energy budgets either through increased energy costs of displacement and barrier effects or decreased energy intake through reduced prey acquisition and assimilation. This, in turn, would lead to poorer body condition with associated impacts on demographic rates, e.g. reduced breeding success or survival. Finally, a sufficient number of individuals need to have altered demographic rates for it to affect population growth rate and size. It is difficult to draw concrete conclusions about how displacement will affect individuals and populations of red-throated divers, in the absence of empirical evidence. Based on our understanding of the ecology of red-throated divers and similar species, the following would seem to be more likely. Red-throated divers appear capable of utilising a range of marine habitats and prey species. They also tend to occur at relatively low densities and not in large aggregations. Consequently, reduced prey intake caused by increased density-dependent competition or interference would seem unlikely. Red-throated divers are highly mobile in winter which may mean they are better able to find alternative foraging sites following displacement. However, individuals tend to be relatively site faithful in winter and in their choice of staging/moulting areas (even though there is large variation among individuals in choice of site). Red-throated divers show a strong stress response and this could temporarily limit their ability to exploit new locations following displacement, even if prey is abundant. Without understanding why divers are so mobile and how their behaviour changes following displacement, it is not possible to infer the energetic consequences of displacement with any certainty. Year-round energetic budgets of red-throated divers are unknown but this information is key to understanding the possible consequences of displacement. An understanding of red-throated diver time budgets during winter, e.g. proportion of time spent foraging, would indicate when individuals are struggling to find sufficient food and might be in poorer condition. If red-throated divers tend to be in poorer condition in the non-breeding season when displacement is occurring, displacement could have an impact on survival and productivity. However, if individuals are in relatively good condition during the non-breeding season and spend only a small proportion of their daily activity budget foraging, they may have the capacity to buffer against any additional energetic expense of displacement and barrier effects.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-24,ZOOREC:ZOOR15312077482,,,,,

Not only the Arctic Five (A5) countries, whose coasts are directly washed by the Arctic Ocean, are interested in their realization, but non-regional states also. The 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) gives them such opportunities. According to UNCLOS, the central part of the Arctic Ocean beyond the 200-mile exclusive economic zones (EEZ) of the Arctic countries can be considered as a high seas enclave, with all freedoms of the high seas: of navigation; of overflight; of fishing; of scientific research; freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines; to construct artificial islands and other installations. The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked, which have equal rights here. In addition, it should be noted that other countries have a right to carry out certain practical activities associated with three (out of six) freedoms named above: of navigation (with some restrictions under Article 234 of UNCLOS); of overflight; freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines - within the Arctic states EEZ. The appearance of new Arctic players interested in its spaces and resources is connected with significant increase in risks and threats, primarily non-military. This is largely due to fundamental differences between the Arctic Ocean and other sea areas, such as the Indian or Atlantic Ocean. Among these differences: only five Arctic states are washed by the Arctic Ocean's waters; shallow depth; small total area; a significant length of the shelf zone; special climate conditions, including ice cap; finally - ecological vulnerability. In this regard, the process of the Arctic region's opening for different kinds of maritime activities implementation poses a problem of the environmental security, protection and preservation of the marine environment and its biological diversity. Despite the fact that security issues in their traditional interpretation are not under the jurisdiction of the Arctic Council, its primary environmental focus indicates that these issues are directly correlated with the main area of its activities. Anyway, the modern interpretation of the security concept includes not only a military, but also an environmental component. For the Arctic states, whose geographical position makes them the first victims of any environmental disaster in the region, the provision of environmental security should be the main priority in their mutual policies. The most effective model for the non-military security threats response in the Arctic is cooperation and coordination between all Arctic states at the regional level. One of the problems in the way is that the Arctic Ocean could not be compared with the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas, to which the Article 123 of the UNCLOS Cooperation of States Bordering Enclosed or Semi-Enclosed Seas provides the states' right to coordinate the management, conservation, exploration and exploitation of the living resources of the sea, and to coordinate the implementation of their rights and duties with respect to the protection and preservation of the marine environment. However, the recent transformation of the international maritime law gives Arctic countries some opportunities in this area.First, the regime of the high seas is becoming less conducive for implementation of specific types of maritime activities. In the future, we can expect that the extent of regulation in this area of the World ocean will be significantly increased. The implementation of the high seas freedoms is largely conditioned by the realization of the tasks to protect and preserve the marine environment and its biodiversity. Second, there is a continuing practice of expanding the authority of coastal states in their jurisdiction zones, especially in the EEZ. Despite the fact that the coastal state is not granted any competence in the field of the EEZ security, the practice of a broad interpretation of the security concept includes food, resource and environment security. The enforcement of such security regimes is becoming an increasingly common practice, even though it imposes certain restrictions for third countries' rights in these sea areas. Finally, the adoption of security measures in the EEZ, on one hand, and at the high sea, on the other, should be recognized interdependent and considered all together. In the near future, the number of potential security threats can be significantly expanded due to the increase in the number of maritime activities participants. In addition to the already existing non-military threats (pollution of the marine environment; illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing), new threats may appear: armed robbery of ships (piracy); acts of terrorism affecting both the shipping and offshore installations (oil and gas platforms); illegal transportation of weapons, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD); illegal transportation of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances; illegal movement of people by sea, including illegal migration.

J,,,,,,,,,Elizabeth Cross,,Predictive Modelling in Complex Uncertain Environments: Optimised exploitation of physics and data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 28 2018,2018,"This project aims to improve the current techniques used to assess the condition and safety of offshore and aerospace structures. The platforms used by the Oil and Gas industry in the North Sea were designed to operate for around 25 years in total. Over 600 of these platforms have now reached the end of their design life and the decision must be taken as to whether they can continue to be used safely or whether they should be decommissioned. For new offshore wind turbines, it is critical to have a good understanding of current structural condition so that maintenance can be planned optimally - unscheduled maintenance and downtime is extremely costly, owing to the difficulty of accessing these structures. Equally, in the aerospace industry, the ability to follow a condition-based maintenance strategy will save much time and money in avoiding unscheduled/emergency repair work. This project brings together researchers from the University of Sheffield, who are experts in Structural Health Monitoring and nonlinear system modelling, with industry experts who are leading the way in the monitoring and assessment of offshore and aerospace structures. The aim of this collaboration is to develop the most accurate means possible of assessing structural condition using monitoring data. The approach that will be taken here will combine the latest developments in artificial intelligence with more traditional methods that exploit understanding of the physics at work. Predictive models based on well-understood physics can often fall short of being able to explain complex behaviour, such as the loading an offshore structure will experience in a changing sea-state. This is where learning from measured data can be used to augment the model and improve prediction at times when the physics doesn't explain the behaviour captured by the sensors. The combination of physics and data-based models will be used to improve the prediction of the forcing a structure experiences from a changing environment. An accurate quantification of this enables one to calculate the stresses a structure has undergone, which leads to a prediction of its current condition. A similar modelling approach will be used to help make predictions about the structure itself. Finally, as well as improving the accuracy of the methods used to assess structural condition, the project aims to quantify the amount of uncertainty inherent in the models and algorithms that will be implemented. This approach acknowledges the fact that it is not always possible to make an accurate prediction of structural condition at a given time, but allows a confidence level to be assigned to each assessment made. To make responsible and optimal decisions concerning the repair or decommission of a structure, understanding the level of confidence one has in an assessment of structural condition is absolutely key.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/S001565/1,,,,,,,,University of Sheffield,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15350181,,,,,

Results of this monitoring are currently reported regionally, in an effort to reflect the impact of spatially varying environmental drivers of change; however, there is concern that these regions reflect policy requirements rather than ecological relevance, particularly for mobile species. We used the monitoring data to identify a series of ecologically coherent regions in which trends in abundance and breeding success varied in a consistent fashion and examined how closely the annually sampled data matched the change quantified by the whole population surveys. The number of ecologically coherent regions identified varied from 2 for the northern gannet Morus bassanus and common guillemot Uria aalge to 7 for the great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo. Trends imputed for ecologically coherent regions more closely matched those observed between whole population censuses and were more consistent than those identified for more policy-driven monitoring regions.

Evaluations used a weight-of-evidence approach based on results from bulk phase chemical analyses and laboratory toxicity testing of shell mound cores, in situ field bioassays using caged mussels, and surficial sediment chemistry. Shell mound cores contained elevated concentrations of metals associated with drilling wastes (e.g., Ba, Cr, Pb, and Zn), as well as monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The highest concentrations along with pockets of free oil were associated with the middle cuttings stratum. Sediments composited from all core strata caused significant acute toxicity and bioaccumulation of Ba and PAHs in test organisms during laboratory exposures. In contrast, caged mussels placed at each of the shell mounds for a period of 57-58 days had greater than 90% survival, and there were no significant differences in survival of mussels placed at the shell mounds and corresponding reference sites. While all mussel samples exhibited increases in shell length, whole animal weight, and tissue lipid content, in some cases growth metrics for the shell mound mussels were significantly higher than those for the reference sites. Concentrations of metals, PAHs, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in tissues of the shell mound mussels were not significantly different from those at reference sites. The presence of labile aromatic hydrocarbons in shell mound cores and absence of significant contaminant accumulation of tissues of caged mussels indicated that chemical contaminants are not being remobilized from the 4H shell mounds. Surficial bottom sediments near the shell mounds contained elevated Ba concentrations that probably were associated with drilling wastes. However, concentrations did not exhibit clear spatial gradients with distance from the shell mounds. Despite a number of storm events during the mussel exposures, maximum currents were 34 cm s(-1) and unlikely to erode materials from the shell mounds. Thus, Ba distributions in bottom sediments probably were due to episodic disturbance such as platform removal or trawling rather than ongoing erosion and dispersion of shell mound solids by near-bottom currents. These results suggest that, in the absence of physical disturbances, contaminants are expected to remain sequestered in the shell mounds. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Catch results for 58 fisheries and various environmental time-series data sets and community indices, including mean trophic level (MTL) and Simpson's diversity index (DI), were used to investigate the impacts of fishing and climate changes on the structure of the fish community in the Tsushima warm current (TWC) region of the Japan/East Sea. The long-term trend in fisheries production was largely dependent on the Japanese sardine that, as a single species, contributed up to 60% of the total production in the Japanese waters of the Japan/East Sea during the late 1980s. Excluding Japanese sardine, production of the small pelagic species was higher during 1960s and 1990s but lower during 1970s and 1980s. This variation pattern generally corresponds with the trend in water temperature, warmer before early 1960s and after 1990s but colder during 1970s and 1980s. The warm-water, large predatory fishes and cold water demersal species show opposite responses to the water temperature in the TWC region, indicating the significant impact of oceanic conditions on fisheries production of the Japan/East Sea. Declines in demersal fishes and invertebrates during 1970s and 1980s suggested some impact of fishing. MTL and DI show a similar variation pattern: higher during 1960s and 1990s but lower during 1970s and 1980s. In particular, the sharp decline during the 1980s resulted from the abundant sardine catches, suggesting that dominant species have a large effect oil the structure of the fish community in the Japan/East Sea. Principal component analysis for 58 time-series data sets of fisheries catches suggested that the fish community varied oil inter-annual to inter-decadal scales; the abrupt changes that occurred in the mid-1970s and late 1980s seemed to correspond closely with the climatic regime shifts in the North Pacific. These results strongly suggest that the structure of the fish community in the Japan/East Sea was largely affected by climatic and oceanic regime shifts rather than by fishing. There is no evidence showing fishing down food webs in the Japan/East Sea. However, in addition to the impacts of abrupt shifts that occurred in the late 1980s, the large predatory and demersal fishes seem to be facing stronger fishing pressure with the collapse of the Japanese sardine.

However, there is an ongoing debate regarding how the increased electricity consumption will influence the CO2 emissions in the power market, both in the short-run and in the long-run. This paper aims to address the issue and investigate the feasibility of the electrification of a large offshore area in the North Sea in comparison to standard concepts to supply energy offshore. A novel integrated model was developed for the purpose that includes and combines a process model of the offshore power generation units and a model of the European power system. The integration of the two models allows to simultaneously simulate the behavior of the offshore energy conversion systems and the effect of electrification on the onshore power system. The outcomes of the analysis show that the environmental performance of electrification is strongly affected by the selected approach to quantify the CO2 emissions associated with power from shore. Taking standard methods to supply offshore energy as basis for comparison, the marginal effect of electrification would result in increased CO2 emissions (+40%), while the average effect would entail large reductions in CO2 emissions (-48% to -90%), the extent of which depends on the geographical scope selected. An analysis on the economics of electrification indicates that its economic viability would be challenging and would not be favoured by a strong European commitment towards environmental policies since the expected increase of power price will outbalance the gains for the reduced emission costs.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,0,16,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Elect Power Engn, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2019-07-09,WOS:000472635900081,,,,,

A series of 3-D runs, testing different turbulence schemes, an internal wave mixing (IWM) parameterisation and the sensitivity to an increase of the surface stress, have been performed with the aim of assessing the relative importance of the advective and mixing processes. The model comparisons mostly evidenced differences in the behaviour of the bottom layer temperature during the last part of the year, which may be due to advection processes. The adoption of an internal wave mixing parameterisation, though managing to reproduce a deeper thermocline, overestimates the mixing around the period of the thermocline breakdown. The run adopting a wind stress increased by 50% provides a better agreement between observed and modelled thermocline. This applies also for surface velocities when compared to Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements, while the bottom ones appear slightly underestimated only in the U-component. The Northern North Sea site appears to be located close to a gyre induced by thermal fronts. Comparisons with nearby wind data measured by an oil rig and by the ships operating in the area seem to confirm that the wind forcing values adopted during the integration are underestimated.

Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) in nearshore water bodies has received increasing attention and could therefore play a role in the transfer of aquaculture operations to offshore areas. IMTA holds scope for multi-use of offshore areas and can bring environmental benefits from making use of waste products and transforming these into valuable co-products. Furthermore, they may act as alternative marine production systems and provide scope for alternative income options for coastal communities, e.g., by acting as nodes for farm operation and maintenance requirements. This paper summarizes the current state of knowledge on the implications of the exposed nature of offshore and open ocean sites on the biological, technological and socio-economic performance of IMTA. Of particular interest is improving knowledge about resource flows between integrated species in hydrodynamic challenging conditions that characterize offshore waters.",,,,,,,,,97,3,0,0,60,0,105,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, GermanyBremerhaven Univ Appl Sci, Fac 1, Appl Marine Biol, Bremerhaven, GermanySeaKult Consulting, Bremerhaven, GermanySwedish Royal Acad Sci, Beijer Inst, Stockholm, SwedenStockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, SwedenUniv Haifa, Charney Sch Marine Sci, Dept Maritime Civilizat, Haifa, IsraelUniv New Brunswick, Seaweed & Integrated Multitroph Aquaculture Res L, St John, NB, Canada",Bremerhaven Univ Appl SciSeaKult Consulting,,,2018-05-15,WOS:000457148100001,,,,,

The single individual from Laguna Joyuda, collected in 2002, was previously misidentified as Phyllorhiza (Agassiz, 1862) and Mastigias has not since been recorded there, while a large population of Mastigias was observed in No Name Key in 2009 and 2010 and may have been present for decades. Identification as Mastigias for both sampling sites was confirmed by molecular systematic analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and ribosomal 16S (16S). Sequences from both molecular markers were identical for all individuals sampled from Puerto Rico and the Florida Keys. Phylogenetic analysis of COI indicated that the introduced Mastigias were most closely related to Mastigias sp. 1 (Dawson, 2005) from Kakaban, Indonesia (Kimura 2-parameter sequence divergence = 1.1%) and distantly related to Mastigias papua (Lesson, 1830) from Palau (6.4-7.2%) and Mastigias sp. 2 (Dawson, 2005) from Papua New Guinea (9.8%). Therefore, the source region may lie somewhere in the central Indo-Malayan region, though determining an exact source region is not possible at this time.

In environments with high spatial and temporal variability, addressing these challenges often requires numerous assumptions regarding organism distributions and their relationships to biophysical features. These assumptions may limit the resolution or accuracy of predictions resulting from survey-based distribution models. We propose an iterative modeling approach that incorporates a negative binomial hurdle, followed by modeling of the relationship of organism distribution and abundance to environmental covariates using generalized additive models (GAM) and generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS). Our approach accounts for key features of survey data by separating binary (presence-absence) from count (abundance) data, separately modeling the mean and dispersion of count data, and incorporating selection of appropriate covariates and response functions from a suite of potential covariates while avoiding overfitting. We apply our modeling approach to surveys of sea duck abundance and distribution in Nantucket Sound (Massachusetts, USA), which has been proposed as a location for offshore wind energy development. Our model results highlight the importance of spatiotemporal variation in this system, as well as identifying key habitat features including distance to shore, sediment grain size, and seafloor topographic variation. Our work provides a powerful, flexible, and highly repeatable modeling framework with minimal assumptions that can be broadly applied to the modeling of survey data with high spatiotemporal variability. Applying GAMLSS models to the count portion of survey data allows us to incorporate potential overdispersion, which can dramatically affect model results in highly dynamic systems. Our approach is particularly relevant to systems in which little a priori knowledge is available regarding relationships between organism distributions and biophysical features, since it incorporates simultaneous selection of covariates and their functional relationships with organism responses.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,8,0,11,,,2045-7758,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USAFriedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nuremberg, Dept Med Informat Biometry & Epidemiol, Erlangen, GermanyRhode Isl Dept Environm Management, West Kingston, RI USAAmer Wind Wildlife Inst, Washington, DC USAUniv Nevada, Dept Geog, Reno, NV 89557 USAUS Fish & Wildlife Serv, Natl Wildlife Refuge Syst, Inventory & Monitoring Branch, Athens, GA USAPaul Ehrlich Inst, Sect Biostat, Langen, Germany",Rhode Isl Dept Environm ManagementAmer Wind Wildlife Inst,,,2019-03-22,WOS:000460668800002,30891185,,,,

These responses appear to be jointly driven by intrinsic physiological and ecological characteristics of higher taxa, such that crustaceans (especially amphipods and harpacticoids) and echinoderms are sensitive to toxics whereas polychaetes, oligochaetes, and nematodes (especially non-selective deposit feeders) are enhanced by organic enrichment. Application of this model to the GOOMEX results implies involvement of both toxicity and organic enrichment. Results of toxicity tests and comparisons of observed contaminant concentrations to known effects levels imply that metals drive the toxicity response. We conclude that (1) long-lasting effects of drilling activity exist in the sedimentary environment around gas production platforms, (2) dual effects of toxicity and organic enrichment probably drive readily detectable responses in benthic meiofauna and macroinfauna to 100-200 m, and (3) the failure to detect evidence of exposure or sublethal impacts on fishes and most larger invertebrates is a joint consequence of their mobility over the relevant scales of environmental change and their negligible exposure to hydrocarbons and other contaminants.",,,,,,,,,106,0,0,0,66,1,123,,,0706-652X,,,,,,,,,,,"TEXAS A&M UNIV, GEOCHEM ENVIRONM RES GRP, COLLEGE STN, TX 77845 USAUNIV WESTERN ONTARIO, DEPT ZOOL, LONDON, ON N6A 5B7, CANADAUNIV TEXAS, INST MARINE SCI, PORT ARANSAS, TX 78373 USATEXAS A&M UNIV, MARINE LAB, GALVESTON, TX 77551 USARUTGERS STATE UNIV, HASKIN SHELLFISH RES LAB, PORT NORRIS, NJ 08349 USAMINERALS MANAGEMENT SERV, US DEPT INTERIOR, NEW ORLEANS, LA 70123 USA",,,,1996-11-01,WOS:A1996WK89800022,,,,,

The rising awareness of environmental impacts has led the public to demand the development of eco-friendly and dependable long-term solutions. Wind energy is acknowledged as among the best renewable energy sources with proven capabilities. The key contributing factor in defining the harnessing effectiveness is the wind availability and efficiency of the wind turbines at the specific wind conditions. But due to the non-uniform wind distribution and the limitations of the existing wind turbines at low wind speeds, countries with lower wind speed are still far away from exploiting wind energy.According to the World Energy Commission, the use of one million kWh of wind power can save 600 tons of CO2 emission. An examination into current energy data for Malaysia indicates that only 0.23% of the wind and solar power combined is employed for electricity production as of 2017. This is due to very low wind speed in this region throughout the year. It is also a leading factor to air-pollutants being suspended in the atmosphere for a longer period. It will impact an imbalance in the environmental conditions, such as acid rain, global warming, rise in sea-level and fluctuating sea levels.This paper reports an investigation into the potential impact of utilizing the advantages of wind energy technology in low speed wind regions as an air-pollutant free energy source, to contribute to the overall reduction of the Air Pollutant Index (API) in localized, impacted areas of Malaysia.

Data was collected during the peak periods of spring and fall passerine migration in each year. We measured bearing and altitude of nocturnal migrants, as well as the average number of migrants flying in the airspace closest to the wind turbines. Using weather data on wind direction and strength during the periods of monitored migration, we calculated flow-assistance of wind in aiding migration. Although there was greater flow-assistance to movement in spring over fall migration, we did not find a significant difference between the preoperational and operational periods in flow-assisted flight. The altitude at which migrants flew did differ with development phase of the wind facility; migrants flew at higher altitudes during years when the turbines were operational compared to preoperational years. Although the proportion of migrants detected in the airspace 0-150 m above ground level (ag1), coinciding with turbine height, did not differ with season or operational phase of the installation, there was a reduction in the proportion of migrants in the airspace just above turbines (151-300 m ag1) when turbines were operational. In general, though, the overall altitudes used by migrants were typically higher than turbine height, so the adjustments we documented would only further reduce what appear to be already low levels of collision risk at this particular facility. We discuss possible reasons why this facility appeared to induce low collision risk to migrants, and how this might inform siting decisions of other wind facilities.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,1712-6568,,,,,,,,,,,"LGL Ltd, King City, ON, CanadaUniv Northern British Columbia, Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Prince George, BC, Canada",LGL Ltd,,,2018-01-18,WOS:000419347000005,,,,,

S. East Coast are engaged in offshore wind energy planning through the Renewable Energy Task Force process led by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). Participants from federal, state, and local government use the task forces as a venue to share information and minimize potential conflicts between existing ocean uses and offshore wind farm construction and operations. Task force participants often only make information available in static map form, making comparisons between data sets challenging. To address this, the North and South Carolina Renewable Energy Task Forces are collaborating with the MarineCadastre.gov team to facilitate data sharing.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and BOEM have been collaborating since 2007 on MarineCadastre. gov, an integrated marine information system that provides jurisdictional, legal, physical, ecological, and ocean use data in a common geographic information system (GIS) framework. The MarineCadastre. gov website was developed in response to a call for a marine information system to support alternative energy development on the outer continental shelf in section 388 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Although the website has been designed specifically to support renewable energy siting within the U. S. outer continental shelf, it is also being used for various other ocean-related efforts. The MarineCadastre. gov website has three primary focus areas: Web map viewers and decision-support tools, a spatial data registry, and technical support and regional capacity building.The North and South Carolina Wind Energy Task Forces are combining national-scale data from the website with information specific to their planning areas into simple viewers available in the Map Gallery section of the website. This approach allows users to assess and minimize potential conflicts of offshore wind energy development and operation with existing ocean uses. Multiple issues, such as fishing, shipping, and defense, are viewed and considered simultaneously, in one location, allowing members of the task force to see their own data in a wider context. This enhances the utility of the information that was previously compared using static maps. Users can turn data layers on and off and pan and zoom to specific locations in the planning area as questions arise. The North and South Carolina Wind Energy Task Force data viewers are a simple but powerful mechanism for identifying areas of potential incompatibility, enhancing communication between task force members, and increasing the overall effectiveness of the task force process.The overarching goal of this work is to support the BOEM task forces in making sound decisions with the best available spatial information to facilitate responsible siting of offshore renewable energy infrastructure. This presentation will provide an overview of the primary focus areas of the MarineCadastre.gov project and its underlying technology, with particular attention given to the collaborations with the BOEM-led renewable energy task forces in North and South Carolina.

Of the various senses, hearing plays a particularly important role for fishes in providing information, often from great distances, from all around these animals. This information is in all three spatial dimensions, often overcoming the limitations of other senses such as vision, touch, taste and smell. Sound is used for communication between fishes, mating behaviour, the detection of prey and predators, orientation and migration and habitat selection. Thus, anything that interferes with the ability of a fish to detect and respond to biologically relevant sounds can decrease survival and fitness of individuals and populations. Since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, there has been a growing increase in the noise that humans put into the water. These anthropogenic sounds are from a wide range of sources that include shipping, sonars, construction activities (e.g., wind farms, harbours), trawling, dredging and exploration for oil and gas. Anthropogenic sounds may be sufficiently intense to result in death or mortal injury. However, anthropogenic sounds at lower levels may result in temporary hearing impairment, physiological changes including stress effects, changes in behaviour or the masking of biologically important sounds. The intent of this paper is to review the potential effects of anthropogenic sounds upon fishes, the potential consequences for populations and ecosystems and the need to develop sound exposure criteria and relevant regulations. However, assuming that many readers may not have a background in fish bioacoustics, the paper first provides information on underwater acoustics, with a focus on introducing the very important concept of particle motion, the primary acoustic stimulus for all fishes, including elasmobranchs. The paper then provides background material on fish hearing, sound production and acoustic behaviour. This is followed by an overview of what is known about effects of anthropogenic sounds on fishes and considers the current guidelines and criteria being used world-wide to assess potential effects on fishes. Most importantly, the paper provides the most complete summary of the effects of anthropogenic noise on fishes to date. It is also made clear that there are currently so many information gaps that it is almost impossible to reach clear conclusions on the nature and levels of anthropogenic sounds that have potential to cause changes in animal behaviour, or even result in physical harm. Further research is required on the responses of a range of fish species to different sound sources, under different conditions. There is a need both to examine the immediate effects of sound exposure and the longer-term effects, in terms of fitness and likely impacts upon populations.",,,,,,,,,192,5,0,0,146,0,217,,,0022-1112,1095-8649,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USALoughine Ltd, Aberdeen, Scotland",Loughine Ltd,,,2019-05-01,WOS:000474071500002,30864159,,,,

Specifically, we manipulated sea urchin densities (removal of all individuals vs. untouched controls at natural densities) on rocky reefs devoid of erect vegetation, and predicted (1) that removal of sea urchins Would differently affect macroalgal assemblage structure between deep (16-18 m) and shallow (8-9 m) reef strata, and that (2) the effect of sea urchin removal on macroalgae Would be altered under different scenarios of sedimentation (ambient vs. enhanced). Experimental circular plots (2 in in diameter) were set up at 3 locations at Gran Canaria (Canarian Archipelago), and were maintained and monitored every 4 wk for 1 y. At the end of the experimental period, the structure of the algal assemblages differed between urchin treatments and depth strata, with a larger cover of turf and bushlike algae where urchins were removed and at the shallow reef stratum. More important, differences in algal assemblage structure between urchin treatments were irrespective of sedimentation levels, but shifted from the shallow to the deep stratum. This interactive effect was, in turn, observed for bushlike algae, as a result of a larger magnitude of response (i.e., larger cover) in the shallow stratum relative to the deep stratum, but was not detected for either turf or crustose coralline algae. These results highlight the importance of some physical conditions (here, differences in depth) to interact with biotic processes (here, urchin abundance) to create patterns in the organization of subtidal and benthic assemblages.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,11,0,11,,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,,,,,,,,,"CIIMAR, P-450123 Oporto, PortugalUniv Las Palmas De GC, BIOGES, Las Palmas De Gc 35017, Canary Islands, SpainEdith Cowan Univ, Ctr Marine Ecosyst Res, Joondalup, WA 6027, Australia",,,,2009-12-01,WOS:000273446900026,,,,,

Large numbers of wind turbines are likely to reduce wind speeds, which lowers estimates of electricity generation from what would be presumed from unaffected conditions. Here, we test how well wind power limits that account for this effect can be estimated without explicitly simulating atmospheric dynamics. We first use simulations with an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) that explicitly simulates the effects of wind turbines to derive wind power limits (GCM estimate), and compare them to a simple approach derived from the climatological conditions without turbines [ vertical kinetic energy (VKE) estimate]. On land, we find strong agreement between the VKE and GCM estimates with respect to electricity generation rates (0.32 and 0.37 We m(-2)) and wind speed reductions by 42 and 44%. Over ocean, the GCM estimate is about twice the VKE estimate (0.59 and 0.29 We m(-2)) and yet with comparable wind speed reductions (50 and 42%). We then show that this bias can be corrected by modifying the downward momentum flux to the surface. Thus, large-scale limits to wind power use can be derived from climatological conditions without explicitly simulating atmospheric dynamics.

There was excellent agreement among the results of porewater tests with three different species (sea urchin embryological development, polychaete reproduction, and copepod nauplii survival). The sediment concentrations of several metals were well in excess of sediment quality assessment guidelines at a number of stations, and good agreement was observed between predicted and observed toxicity.

However, uncertainties around the impacts of offshore wind on the environment, particularly marine birds, increase consent risk for future developments. Offshore wind farms are known to cause displacement of wintering red-throated divers (Gavia stellate), resulting in increased consent risk for projects planned for areas of high diver density. However, the consequences of this displacement at the individual and population level are unknown. Displacement is likely to increase energetic costs for divers but their ability to cope with these additional costs will depend on how energetically constrained they are. For the first time, energetics of red-throated divers is being investigated by the Red-throated Diver Energetics Project. Using time depth recorders and geolocators attached to red-throated divers on their breeding grounds, novel information on foraging behaviour of divers will be obtained. Divers are sensitive to disturbance and are a difficult species to work with, but the experience and expertise of ringers ensured all tags were successfully deployed. During the summer of 2018, a total of 74 red-throated divers were tagged. Breeding birds were caught either using a nest trap or a wader net. All birds were fitted with two tags, a time depth recorder and a geolocator tag, as well as a metal ring with a unique number. Altogether, 31 red-throated divers were tagged in southern Finland, 31 in Scotland and 12 in Iceland. In Iceland and Finland, approximately equal numbers of males and females were tagged, whereas there was a slight bias towards tagging females in Scotland. Sex was assigned according to biometrics. Red-throated divers had a poor breeding season in the Northern Isles, Scotland, with an average of 38% of nesting attempts producing a well grown chick, close to fledging. By contrast, 62% of nests in Finland fledged at least one chick. Given the sensitivity of divers to disturbance and the poor breeding season in Scotland, it was important to check that trapping divers did not affect their breeding success. Reassuringly, a comparison of breeding success for red-throated diver nests at which trapping of divers occurred and control nests with no trapping, showed no discernible effect of trapping on breeding success, in both Scotland and Finland. Tagged divers will be recaptured in 2019, tags removed and data downloaded and analysed. Additionally, breeding success and other data will be collected at nests where trapping occurs and at control sites, to investigate any effects on divers from carrying tags for a year and/or a second season of trapping. Analyses of data retrieved from the tags will reveal dive frequency, depth and duration for red-throated divers, enabling assessment of the proportion of time divers spend foraging throughout the year. Periods when divers spend longest foraging will indicate when they are most energetically challenged. This information will provide key evidence to understand the time of year when divers are least able to cope with additional energetic costs, which will provide insight into the potential consequences of displacing wintering red-throated divers.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-07-24,ZOOREC:ZOOR15508048256,,,,,

Numerical simulations of the wind turbines using the NREL developed software FAST 8 are the means of conducting the tests. In varying the gains, the work discovers that the best controller for a DFIG differs greatly from the best controller for a PMSG. In addition, the work found that the vibration damping in a DFIG turbine is different when the source of the vibration-causing disturbance is considered.

Little is known of the effects of PFW on tropical marine organisms, especially keystone species. Exposing the coral Plesiastrea versipora to a range (3-50% v/v) of PFW from Harriet A oil platform resulted in a reduction in photochemical efficiency of the symbiotic dinoflagellate algae in hospite ( in the coral tissues), assessed as a decrease in the ratio of variable fluorescence (F-v) to maximal fluorescence (F-m) measured using chlorophyll fluorescence techniques. Significant differences were noted at PFW concentrations >12.5% ( v/v). In corals where F-v/F-m was significantly lowered by PFW exposure, significant discolouration of the tissues occurred in a subsequent 4-day observation period. The discolouration ( coral bleaching) was caused by a loss of the symbiotic dinoflagellates from the tissues, a known sublethal stress response of corals. PFW caused a significant decrease in F-v/F-m in symbiotic dinoflagellates freshly isolated from the coral Heliofungia actiniformis at 6.25% PFW, slightly lower than the studies in hospite. Corals exposed to lower PFW concentrations (range 0.1%-10% PFW v/v) for longer periods (8 days) showed no decrease in F-v/F-m, discolouration, loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates or changes in gross photosynthesis or respiration ( measured using O-2 exchange techniques).

Liver and bile samples were analyzed for PAHs and their metabolites using triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-F), respectively. Data were compared among species and sub-regions of the GoM to understand spatiotemporal exposure dynamics in these economically and ecologically important species. Significant differences in the composition and concentrations of PAHs were detected spatially, over time and by species. The West Florida Shelf, Cuba coast and the Yucatan Shelf had a greater proportion of the pyrogenic PAHs in their livers than the other regions likely due to non-oil industry related sources (e.g., marine vessel traffic) in the regional composition profiles. Mean liver PAH concentrations were highest in the north central region of the GoM where DWH occurred. Biliary PAH concentrations and health indicator biometrics initially decrease during the first three years following the DWH oil spill but significantly increased thereafter. Increased exposures are likely explained by the resuspension of residual DWH oil as well as continued inputs from natural (e.g., seeps) sources and other anthropogenically derived sources (e.g., riverine runoff, other oil spills, and leaking oil and gas infrastructure). The increasing trend in PAH concentrations in the bile and liver of grouper species in the north central region of the GoM post-DWH suggest continued chronic exposures, however the critical stage at which permanent, irreparable damage may occur is unknown. Long-term monitoring of PAH levels and associated fish health biomarkers is necessary to evaluate impacts of chronic exposures, particularly in regions subject to intensive oil extraction activities.

A comprehensive evaluation was developed and applied using Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) tidal turbine site as a case study of a developing industry with no standard monitoring methods. Before-After monitoring datasets that contained change were simulated using normal and non-normal empirical baseline data collected at a MRE site. Thirteen regression models from three classes were evaluated: 6 generalized regression models, 4 time series models, and 3 non parametric models. Intervention Analysis was used to fit models to five change scenarios that included three amplitudes of change and a lag in the onset of change. A power analysis was used to evaluate model ability to detect change. Residual error diagnostics were used to quantify model fit and forecast accuracy. Parametric models that did not include lagged dependent variables were the most capable at detecting change. A comparison of the fit and forecast metric results indicated that deterministic time series models in conjunction with semi-parametric generalized regression models provided a robust and informative quantification of change. Nonparametric models most accurately forecasted change. The results provide insight on model behavior, which is used to recommend specific models to measure change in the case study data.

Currently, the technology is not completely prepared for a commercial development and its levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is still high. In fact, there are numerous types of wave energy converters (WECs) in the development phase. Given the differences between them, there are several classifications based on different aspects such as the location in relation to the distance to the coast and the bathymetry, the position relative to the sea level, the size and orientation, and the energy capture principle. However, none of the existing classifications considers the operating range at rated power according to the power matrix of the devices. This paper includes a new proposal for classification of WECs, named OPERAWEC (Operation Waver Energy Converters), with the aim of covering that gap. A methodology to implement the classification to different WECs is proposed, and that methodology is applied to ten different existing WECs (Wave Dragon, Pelamis, Aquabuoy, Archimedes Wave Swing, Oyster, Oceantec, OE Buoy, Pontoon, Seabed AB and Wavebob), classifying them into six different groups (Group I, Group II, Group III, Group IV, Group V and Group VI). Most of them belong to the Group IV and/or Group V, and some of them are categorised into several groups. The paper ends showing how to apply OPERAWEC classification as a part of a screening process for WECs selection in the Spanish Atlantic coast. Wave resource is assessed in two specific locations (Estaca de Bares and Golfo de Cadiz), considering four WECs (Pelamis, Aquabuoy, Archimedes Wave Swing, and Oyster). According OPERAWEC classification, Group II WECs for Estaca de Bares, and Group I and Group II WECs for Golfo de Cadiz are recommended.",,,,,15th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)15th International Coastal Symposium (ICS),"MAY 13-18, 2018MAY 13-18, 2018",Korea Inst Ocean Sci & Technol; Korea Soc Coastal Disaster Prevent; JCR; Coastal Educ & Res FdnKorea Inst Ocean Sci & Technol; Korea Soc Coastal Disaster Prevent; JCR; Coastal Educ & Res Fdn,"Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Politecn Madrid, Res Grp Marine Coastal & Port Environm & Other Se, Madrid, Spain",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000441173100258,,,,,

The undertaken research explored the attitudes of two important social groups (local residents and tourists/recreational users) regarding locating wind parks in the marine and/or terrestrial environment along the Latvian coast of the Baltic Sea. The results of the study indicate that both groups support land-based wind park development versus offshore. Moreover, the visibility of wind turbines influences the willingness of tourists to visit recreation sites and impacts directly on their duration of stay.

The surf zone copepod assemblage is dominated by 7 species; Acartia hudsonica, Pseudodiaptomus marinus, Paracalanus indicus, Calanus sinicus, Oithona similis, Sinocalanus tenellus and Labidocera bipinnata. Threefold variations in copepod abundance are observed within a die( cycle. Abundances of 7 dominant species and total copepods captured in the surface exhibit significant diel differences, but those taken in the bottom are not significantly affected by diel period. it is shown that about 90% of the surf zone copepods performed DHM. The nocturnal high densities of copepods occurred for a neap tide when the offshore winds prevailed, suggesting the animals' ability for horizontal orientation and an active locomotion without invoking passive transportation by currents. Photoreactive behavior of copepods triggered by relative changes in light intensity may be a primary factor inducing DHM by aggregating in the surf zone during the night and spreading out at day; then copepods may reduce encounters with visual predators. In A. hudsonica, ontogenetic variations in timings of DHM are evident. Such variations are likely to minimize intraspecific competition for diets. Data on shoreward migration of copepods indicate that A. hudsonica, P. indicus, O. asimilis and S. tenellus can maintain swimming velocities of about 20 m h-1 for durations of more than an hour. Our observations of strong diel difference in abundances point out the need for both day and night samplings in surf zone habitats, if the importance of these habitats to planktonic copepods are to be fully understood.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,0,3,,,0374-8111,,,,,,,,,,,"Dep.

To advise coastal managers, models must predict quantitatively the effects of environmental change on population size or the demographic rates (mortality and reproduction) that determine it. As habitat association models and depletion models are not able to do this, we developed an approach that has produced such predictions thereby enabling policy makers to make evidence-based decisions. Our conceptual framework is individual-based ecology, in which populations are viewed as having properties (e.g. size) that arise from the traits (e.g. behaviour, physiology) and interactions of their constituent individuals. The link between individuals and populations is made through individual-based models (IBMs) that follow the fitness-maximising decisions of individuals and predict population-level consequences (e.g. mortality rate) from the fates of these individuals. Our first IBM was for oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus and accurately predicted their density-dependent mortality. Subsequently, IBMs were developed for several shorebird and wildfowl species at several European sites, and were shown to predict accurately overwinter mortality, and the foraging behaviour from which predictions are derived. They have been used to predict the effect on survival in coastal birds of sea level rise, habitat loss, wind farm development, shellfishing and human disturbance. This review emphasises the wider applicability of the approach, and identifies other systems to which it could be applied. We view the IBM approach as a very useful contribution to the general problem of how to advance ecology to the point where we can routinely make meaningful predictions of how populations respond to environmental change.",,,,,,,,,71,0,0,0,70,0,80,,,1464-7931,1469-185X,,,,,,,,,,"Bournemouth Univ, Sch Conservat Sci, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, EnglandHavering, Lympstone EX8 5JT, Devon, England",Havering,,,2010-08-01,WOS:000279722700001,19961470,,,,

The Louisiana coastal erosion problem is especially dire because it occurs on several fronts with the narrowing and overtopping of barrier islands and loss of back barrier bay and interior marshlands. Coastal restoration efforts in Louisiana depend on emplacement of sediment to build up barrier island and deltaic systems. Discovery of usable sediment is thus a vital factor in restoration efforts because up to 80% of some restoration project budgets can be allocated to exploration, exploitation, and emplacement of sediment. Because this cost is directly proportional to the distance of borrow sources from the project area, the cost-effectiveness of barrier island restoration and marsh creation depends on locating sufficient sediment volumes that are suitable for placement on beaches and dunes and for creating marshes.The restoration of Louisiana's barrier islands and the creation of coastal marshes are critically dependent on the availability of suitable modern marine and riverine sediments and other buried fluvio-deltaic deposits. It is thus imperative that a comprehensive sediment management plan be developed to systematically and efficiently identify and allocate suitable sediment resources. At present, coastal and barrier island restoration projects are included in regional planning efforts, and the restoration project is decided before sediment sources are considered. The new approach proposed here is based on planning projects around locations of dredgeable sedimentary deposits in order to optimize sediment resources. Centralization of voluminous historical geoscientific and oil and gas infrastructure data is being accommodated in a new data management system called the Louisiana Sand Resource Database (LASARD). Managing sediment resources more strategically optimizes regional planning strategies and reduces construction costs.

The discovery of fossil fuel reserves in the seabed of Campeche Sound in the 1970s promoted the rapid expansion of the national oil industry in offshore waters. Unfortunately, the accidental blowout of the most productive well (Ixtoc-I) in June of 1979, caused the first world massive oil spill in a tropical marine environment. More than 3.4 million of barrels of crude oil were liberated in an ecosystem formerly renowned for its pristine conditions. In the aftermath of this dreadful accident, a growing concern emerged not only for the oil acute effects but also for the long-term environmental consequences derived from the residual hydrocarbon compounds accumulated in coastal environments of the southern Gulf of Mexico. The attempts to assess the magnitude of the environmental damage were strongly precluded by the lack of pre-spill information. Natural variability in the ecosystem and oil weathering-factors contributed to attenuate the acute pollution effects that lasted nearly 9 months. However, the post-spill environmental alterations caused by the Ixtoc-I blowout still remain unanswered.

Large-scale seabird mortality was relatively well documented only for tanker dumping of waste oil in 1917-1925 and the 1937 Frank H. Buck oil spill, both off San Francisco. Following significant spills in 1969 (Santa Barbara) and 1971 (San Francisco), greater effort was spent on mortality documentation, beached bird surveys, and rehabilitation. With the experiences of the 1984 Puerto Rican and 1986 Apex Houston oil spills and passage of federal and state oil pollution acts in 1990, efforts to document seabird mortality have been standardized, estimates of total mortality refined, rehabilitation programs improved, and restoration programs implemented. Forty-four oil spills with recorded mortality of greater than 10 seabirds have occurred on the California coast from 1969-2001. Only 3 of these spills were from offshore oil platforms or pipelines and most were from oil tankers, other ships, and sunken vessels. Continuing efforts are needed to improve techniques for mortality quantification, to improve post-release survival of rehabilitated birds, to develop new methods of effective restoration and to determine the long-term population value of restoration actions. These efforts should alleviate some of the impacts of oil pollution on certain seabird populations in California over time.

The oil was added in five different concentrations (100, 400, 1000, 4000, 10000 ppm wet weight oil in sediment). The oil content persisted at about the same level in each treatment throughout the experimental period of 4.5 months. Concentrations above 1000 ppm oil resulted in a reduction in redox-potentials in the sediments. This indirect effect of oil was probably responsible for the observed decline in abundance of the deeper burrowing species. All the most common species were present in all treatments, but most species showed decreasing densities with increasing oil concentrations. The tolerance to the oiled conditions was different among the different species. Among the meiofauna, and especially for ostracods, significant effects were found at 400 ppm and higher, while effects on macrofauna were most pronounced above 1000 ppm. However, not only tolerance to oil, but differences in exposure to the oiled sediment due to differences in behaviour or distributional patterns seems to be of importance for the species response to the oiled sediment. Although most of the species were found to recolonize defaunated mudflat areas within a short time, our results indicate that an oil spill will cause prolonged effects to this mudflat community structure due to high persistence of oil in sediment and that a few of the most abundant species have low tolerance to oil or very low dispersal.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,7,0,19,,,0036-4827,,,,,,,,,,,"NORWEGIAN INST WATER RES,N-0411 OSLO,NORWAY",,,,1995-01-01,WOS:A1995TT71000002,,,,,

In this paper the dynamics of a wind turbine drive train high speed subsystem is studied both by modeling and experiments with focus on system torsional and flexural vibrations and transient events which can reduce fatigue life of functional components (gearbox, bearings, shafts, couplings, others). A scaled down drive train high speed shaft test rig has been developed. Main components of the test rig are six-pole motor with variable frequency drive controller (up to 1000 rpm), shafts' disk coupling and flexible mounting structure representing gearbox housing with output high speed bearing. The test rig is equipped with measurement system comprising a set of accelerometers and displacement sensors, data acquisition hardware and software (SKF WindCon3.0). Mathematical and computational models of the test rig have been developed and went through validation tests. The system kinematic and dynamic responses are studied for different operational scenarios and structural parameters (ratio of shaft bending stiffness and stiffness of mounting structures, unevenly inertia load distribution, others). The ultimate goal of the test rig is to get insight into interaction between internal dynamics of drive train functional components to be used the results obtained in developing novel methods to detect, predict and prevent faults and failures in wind turbine drive trains arising due to misalignments and transient external loads.",,,,,ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering ConferenceASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference,"AUG 02-05, 2015AUG 02-05, 2015","ASME, Design Engn Div; ASME, Comp & Informat Engn DivASME, Design Engn Div; ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div","Boston, MABoston, MA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5718-2,,,,,,,,,"Chalmers, Dept Appl Mech, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden",,,,2016-09-13,WOS:000380414000061,,,,,

Understanding critical habitat for whale sharks is essential on both a regional and global basis for proper management because of their large migratory range. The goal of the present study was to describe the regional distribution of whale shark feeding aggregations in the NGOM by exploiting a presence-only dataset collected as a part of a volunteer sighting survey. Whale shark aggregations have been documented in large numbers in the NGOM since 2003, and species distribution models provide a unique approach to analyzing these presence data. We used maximum entropy and ecological niche factor analysis, 2 algorithms designed for predicting species distribution based only on presence data, to analyze data for the summer period in 2008 and 2009. Cohen's kappa (kappa) and the 'area under the receiver operating characteristic curve' (AUC) were used to evaluate model performance with an external testing dataset. Kappa values ranged from 0.28 to 0.69, and AUC values ranged from 0.73 to 0.80, indicating that the predicted distribution had a fair to substantial agreement with the testing data. Distance to continental shelf edge, distance to adjacent petroleum platforms, and chlorophyll a were the variables most strongly related to whale shark sightings, likely due to an association of these variables with high food availability. Suitable habitat was predicted along the continental shelf edge, with the most suitable habitat predicted south of the Mississippi River Delta. The spatial distribution of suitable habitat is dynamic; therefore, a multi-year study is underway to better delineate temporal trends in regional whale shark distribution and to identify consistent areas of high suitability.

Concerns have been focused on the impacts of pile driving noise on the Taiwanese white dolphin which is on the IUCN list of extremely endangered species. To deal with the problem, both state and developers have been involved in volumetric practices which attempt to render the marine mammals knowable, and in turn, governable. While recent work on volumetric thinking has revealed that power is exercised through volume, we contend that insufficient attention has been given to those lively 'non-human' subjects living in the volumetric spaces. Inspired by recent scholarship on animal atmospheres and the wet ontologies, we argue that marine animals are sentient beings that cannot be known, or mapped, by the state-corporate volumetric practices which are mainly based on scientific experiments, conducted in isolated social contexts. To illustrate this, we draw on assemblage thinking and develop the idea of marine animal soundscapes. We suggest that marine animal soundscapes exist only through the embodied experience of a sensory, marine animal body, which is able to affect, and learn to be affected by, others, through non-linguistic 'signs', such as sound. We maintain that animal soundscapes are shaped by social, ecological and material circumstances, of which, the materialities of the sea, such as its liquidity, rapidity and fluidity, are of great importance. With an emphasis on the subaquatic animal soundscapes, our approach intends to extend social relationality to non-humans and calls for an ontology, distinct from the one with which existing volumetric analysts work.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,,,0962-6298,1873-5096,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioind Commun & Dev, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, TaiwanNatl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Technol Management, 101,Sect 2,Kuang Fu Rd, Hsinchu 300044, Taiwan",,,,2021-01-14,WOS:000602373100006,,,,,

This is known as a runaway situation. Unlike many other types of turbine, a marine current turbine will typically overshoot the final runaway speed before slowing down and settling at the runaway speed. Since the hydrodynamic forces acting on the turbine are dependent on rotational speed and acceleration, turbine behaviour during runaway becomes important for load analyses during turbine design. In this article, we consider analytical and numerical models of marine current turbine runaway behaviour in one dimension. The analytical model is found not to capture the overshoot phenomenon, while still providing useful estimates of acceleration at the onset of runaway. The numerical model incorporates turbine wake build-up and predicts a rotational speed overshoot. The predictions of the models are compared against measurements of runaway of a marine current turbine. The models are also used to recreate previously-published results for a tidal turbine and applied to a wind turbine. It is found that both models provide reasonable estimates of maximum accelerations.

Compared to adjacent reference sites, the initial effects were very marked, especially on the upper shore. Oiling was heavier and more persistent on the upper shore than the mid-shore, and biological effects were more pronounced higher in the intertidal. At both levels, however, there was little evidence of recovery up to 5 months after oiling, and visible oil residues were still apparent.

The lengthy environmental compliance process, estimated to incur a 7-10 year permitting timeline [1], has been identified as a significant impediment to offshore energy development in U.S. waters. During operation, seabirds can collide and be displaced by turbines. During episodic pre-operation phases, cetaceans are most heavily impacted acoustically by pile driving (and similarly seismic air gun surveys for oil and gas exploration). The varying nature of impacts in space and time leads us to conclude that sites should be selected in space to minimize long-term operational impacts on seabirds, and timing of surveying and construction activities to be conducted in times of the year when sensitive migratory marine mammals are least present. We developed a novel spatiotemporal decision support framework that interactively visualizes tradeoffs between OWED industry profits and wildlife sensitivities, in both space and time. The framework highlights sites on a map that are the most profitable and least sensitive to seabirds. Within the U.S. Mid-Atlantic study area, the New York Call Areas are particularly well optimized for minimal impact on seabirds with maximal profits to OWED. For a given site, pre-operational activities (e.g. pile driving and seismic air gun surveying) are advised by cetacean sensitivity across months of the year that minimize impacts on migratory cetaceans, particularly those of highest conservation concern such as the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena Glacialis). For instance, within optimal sites for the New York Call Area the least impacting months are May and June. Other taxa are certainly affected by OWED and should be incorporated into this framework, but data on their distributions and/or sensitivities is currently less well known. Built with open-source software made publicly available, the authors hope this framework will be extended even more comprehensively into the future as our knowledge on species distributions and OWED sensitivities expands for streamlining environmental compliance.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,9,0,17,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"EcoQuants LLC, Santa Barbara, CA 93103 USADuke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Marine Geospatial Ecol Lab, Durham, NC 27708 USA",EcoQuants LLC,,,2019-06-04,WOS:000467843000004,31086363,,,,

In this unique field study we test a hypothesis on the mechanisms defining mobile predator foraging habitat characteristics by comparing temporally and spatially detailed bio-physical oceanographic data from contrasting topographical locations. We contrast the foraging locations of two very different seabird species, gannets and storm petrels, by repeatedly sampling a bank and a nearby flat area over daily tidal cycles during spring and neap tides. The results suggest that storm petrels are linked to foraging in specific locations where internal waves are produced, which is mainly on banks. These locations can also include the presence of high biomass of chlorophyll. In contrast, the location where more gannets are foraging is significantly influenced by temporal variables with higher densities of foraging birds much more likely during the neap tide than times of spring tide. The foraging times of both species was influenced by differences between the vertical layers of the water column above and below the thermocline; via either vertical shear of horizontal currents or absolute differences in speed between layers. Higher densities of foraging gannets were significantly more likely to be found at ebb tides in both bank and flat regions however over the bank, the density of foraging gannets was higher when the differences in speed between the layers were at a maximum. Both gannets and storm petrels appear to be more likely to forage when wind direction is opposed to tidal direction. This detailed understanding links foraging behaviour to predictable spatial and temporal bio-physical vertical characteristics and thus can be immediately used to explain variance and increase certainty in past abundance and distributional surveys. These results also illuminate the types of variables that should be considered when assessing potential changes to the distribution and characteristics of habitats from increased anthropogenic disturbances such as large scale offshore wind, wave and tidal renewable deployments.

Fossil fuels are predicted to be exhausted in some decades. Moreover, their consumption is known to be very harmful to all living species. Wind and wave powers, as renewable energy sources with no emissions, represent better alternatives for electricity generation. The aim of the present study is to develop a model to assess a wave-wind hybrid energy system. The idea of adding a wave energy harvester to a floating or a fixed-support wind turbine structure contributes to increase the system reliability. Thus, a mathematical model was used to assess not only the components of the wind-wave hybrid system (e.g., wind turbine, wave converter, and foundation), but also the system costs and the cost recovery period. The wave energy converter selected for the hybrid device was a Wavestar prototype combined with a wind turbine. The engineering and economic improvements of the system and associated costs were calculated.

Approximately 7.9 million liters of dispersant, Corexit EC9500A, was used during the spill between May 15th and July 12th. Marsh soil samples were collected from an unimpacted marsh site proximal to coastal areas that suffered light to heavy oiling for a laboratory evaluation to determine the effect of Corexit on the wetland soil microbial biomass as well as N-mineralization and denitrification rates. Microbial biomass nitrogen (N) values were below detection for the 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000 Corexit:wet soil treatments. The potentially mineralizable N (PMN) rate correlated with microbial biomass with significantly lower rates for the 1:10 and 1:100 Corexit:wet soil additions. Potential denitrification rates for Corexit:wet soil ratios after immediate dispersant exposure were below detection for the 1:10 treatment, while the 1:100 was 7.6 +/- 2.7% of the control and the 1:1000 was 33 +/- 4.3% of the control. The 1:10000 treatment was not significantly different from the control. Denitrification rates measured after 2 weeks exposure to the surfactant found the 1:10 treatment still below detection limit and the 1:100 ratio was 12 +/- 2.6% of the control. Results from this lab study suggest that chemical dispersants have the potential to negatively affect the wetland soil microbial biomass and resultant microbial activity. Consequences of exposure led to reductions in several important microbial-regulated ecosystem services including water quality improvement (denitrification) and ecosystem primary productivity (N-mineralization). Future studies should investigate the longer-term impacts of dispersant exposure on the microbial consortia to determine if microbial activity recovers over time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerical simulations will be carried out and compared with experimental measurements, which will reveal with great details the fluid-structure interaction of the floating offshore energy device and impact force exerting on pile-structures subjected to waves and currents.

Three samples were taken with a 0.1 m(2) Van Veen grab (33 x 30 x 15 cm) at each station from 12 sampling stations of two different geographical areas. The water depth ranged from 6.5 m to 34.0 m. The mean values of species number, abundance and species diversity (H') were 24 species/grab, 77 animals/grab and 3.35/grab, respectively. A total of 172 species was recorded. Total petroleum hydrocarbons were strongly negatively related to species number, abundance and species diversity, suggesting that petroleum hydrocarbons have harmful effects on macrobenthic communities. The BIO-ENV analyses for all stations identified median particle size, silt-clay content, salinity and Zn as the major environmental variables influencing the infaunal patterns. However, separate analyses for two areas produced stronger correlations and different best-correlated environmental variable combinations. Total petroleum hydrocarbons were the only common factor in both areas, showing the importance of petroleum contamination in determining the community structure of benthic infauna in Singaporean waters.

Marine and ocean energy sources draw attention through their high energy potential. Offshore wind and marine current energy is an attractive RES with great potential. The wind and current energy in the marine produces an intermittent and unstable power by nature. Energy storage systems are the most effective solution to minimize power fluctuations in the system and to ensure stable energy demand. This paper presents a novel optimal energy management strategy (NOEMS) for optimal power flow control of the offshore wind/marine current/battery/ultracapacitor hybrid power generation system and for the most efficient harvesting of hybrid renewable energy system (HRES). The proposed NOEMS algorithm calculates as real time the amount of power generated by the HRES and demanded by the load. In this study, nine different dynamic operation modes were considered. Experimental results have shown that the battery and ultracapacitor support to the HRES. In this study, the dynamic behavior of the NOEMS algorithm was investigated by performing a sudden load test from 18 W to 30 W. The NOEMS algorithm shows that the system can minimize power loss, voltage fluctuation, control the charge/discharge status of the battery and ultracapacitor. The proposed algorithm continuously shifts the required power over the hybrid energy storage system to provide the load demand continuously. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

It is known that in industrial workers, working conditions and climatic features of the Arctic create an increased risk of occupational diseases. The purpose of the study was to investigate the impact of working conditions on the structure and prevalence of occupational pathology among the working population of the gas and oil producing region in the Arctic.The aim of the study is to explore working conditions, the structure and prevalence of PP in the working population of the gas-oil-producing region in the Arctic.Materials and methods. The data of social and hygienic monitoring in the section Working conditions and occupational morbidity of the population of the Nenets and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Districts from 2007 to 2017 were studied.Results. It was found that employees in the Arctic gas and oil producing region were most frequently exposed to noise (24.0%), poor microclimate parameters (10.1%), non-ionizing electromagnetic fields and radiation (9.7%). The combined effect of several factors was found in 24.8% of workers. There were 285 patients with newly diagnosed OD, 67.0% of whom were air transport workers, and 14.4% were employed in the gas and oil industry. The structure of the occupational pathology was dominated by sensorineural hearing loss (77.9%). In 2017, the regional level of occupational morbidity exceeded the national level by 1.7 times, among air transport workers - by 1.9 times, while among employees of gas and oil producing enterprises it was 5.3 times less than the national industry indicator. The risk of OD development among air transport workers was higher than in the region as a whole (RR = 45,88; CI 38,3-54,9), in oil and gas companies workers (RR=141,0; CI 100,8-197,2) and in workers of all types of transport, except air transport (RR =68,3; CI 39,8-117,4).Conclusion. In the Arctic gas and oil producing region, most often occupational pathology is recorded among air transport workers, which necessitates the use of a comprehensive program for its prevention.

Baseline knowledge of population structure of a species is critical to developing strategies for management and conservation. There is little information for the saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis), an abundant forage fish inhabiting the coastlines of the North Pacific and Arctic oceans. We examined saffron cod population genetic structure with data from nine microsatellite loci designed to describe the genetic compositions of and variation among 40 collections of saffron cod from four regions (northwestern Alaska, Gulf of Alaska, western Pacific Ocean, and Gulf of Anadyr). The northwestern Alaska collections (Norton Sound and Chukchi Sea) exhibited little genetic divergence. The Gulf of Anadyr collection differed from other regions but was most similar to those of northwestern Alaska. The collections from the western Pacific Ocean (Sakhalin Island and Hokkaido Island) differed genetically, but not to the extent they did from other regions. Gulf of Alaska collections (Kodiak Island and Prince William Sound) comprised a lineage that was distinct from all of the other areas, including the geographically adjacent northwestern Alaska collections. The absence of genetic structure in northwestern Alaska probably reflects their recent expansion into previously unavailable habitat that became available after the Last Glacial Maximum (similar to 16,000 years ago).

The role of chemical dispersants (e.g., Corexit) applied during the DWH oil spill clean-up in helping or hindering the formation of this MOSSFA event are not well-understood. Here, we present the first experiment related to the DWH oil spill to specifically investigate the relationship between microbial community structure, oil and Corexit (R), and marine oil-snow in coastal surface waters. We observed the formation of micron-scale aggregates of microbial cells around droplets of oil and dispersant and found that their rate of formation was directly related to the concentration of oil within the water column. These micro-aggregates are potentially important precursors to the formation of larger marine oil-snow particles. Therefore, our observation that Corexit (R) significantly enhanced their formation suggests dispersant application may play a role in the development of MOSSFA events. We also observed that microbial communities in marine surface waters respond to oil and oil plus Corexit (R) differently and much more rapidly than previously measured, with major shifts in community composition occurring within only a few hours of experiment initiation. In the oil-amended treatments without Corexit (R), this manifested as an increase in community diversity due to the outgrowth of several putative aliphatic-and aromatic-hydrocarbon degrading genera, including phytoplankton-associated taxa. In contrast, microbial community diversity was reduced in mesocosms containing chemically dispersed oil. Importantly, different consortia of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria responded to oil and chemically dispersed oil, indicating that functional redundancy in the pre-spill community likely results in hydrocarbon consumption in both undispersed and dispersed oils, but by different bacterial taxa. Taken together, these data improve our understanding of how dispersants influence the degradation and transport of oil in marine surface waters following an oil spill and provide valuable insight into the early response of complex microbial communities to oil exposure.",,,,,,,,,64,0,0,0,50,0,69,,,1664-302X,,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USATexas A&M Univ, Geochem & Environm Res Grp, College Stn, TX USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Sci, Galveston, TX 77553 USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA",,,,2018-04-11,WOS:000429650500001,29696005,,,,

Fundamental aspects in invasion ecology are not yet fully understood, as there is neither a clear definition of invasive species nor their characteristics. Likewise, regulations to tackle marine invasions are fragmentary and either restricted to specific regions or certain aspects of the invasion process. Nonetheless, marine anthropogenic vectors (e.g., vessel fouling, ballast water, aquaculture, marine static structures, floating debris, and human-mediated climate change) are well described. The most important distribution vector for marine non-indigenous species is the shipping sector, composed by vessel fouling and ballast water discharge. Ship traffic is a constantly growing sector, as not only ship sizes are increasing, but also remote environments such as the polar regions are becoming accessible for commercial use. To mitigate invasions, it is necessary to evaluate species' capability to invade a certain habitat, as well as the risk of a region of becoming invaded. On an ecological level, this may be achieved by Ecological Niche Modelling based on environmental data. In combination with quantitative vector data, sophisticated species distribution models may be developed. Especially the ever-increasing amount of available data allows for comprehensive modelling approaches to predict marine invasions and provide valuable information for policy makers.

One such resource is wind energy and while the onshore and fixed offshore wind energy industries are mature, the floating offshore wind energy industry is still at a demonstration phase. Floating wind turbine platforms are generally of a much smaller displacement than the typical offshore structures that have been used in the oil and gas industry. This difference results in changes to the platform dynamics, especially those resulting from second order wave forces. Existing research into low frequency drift motions of small body platforms has been mainly confined to numerical modelling with some experimental work. This work expands on this knowledge by validating numerical modelling with full scale observational data.In this paper, a numerical time-domain model of a relatively small displacement platform is developed. The platform is installed in a relatively shallow water depth of about 110 m and station keeping is provided by four equally spaced catenary mooring chains. The required fidelity for the low frequency response is compared using first order forces only and either a full QTF (quadratic transfer equation) or Newman's approximation. The model is compared with observation data from the Fukushima FORWARD project's floating substation, an advanced spar type, which is composed of measurements of multidirectional wave spectra, wind and current as model inputs and six DOF platform motions as outputs. In addition to this the model computational expense is reduced by decreasing the number of wave directions simulated. The accuracy of such reductions is then described. Observation data is grouped according to sea-state data. An empirical drag coefficient formula is proposed.

In spring, eiders took an average of 16 days (range=2-47) in 2012 and 20 days (range=1-61) in 2013 to migrate from wintering grounds to summer areas, whereas the duration of fall migration averaged 47 days (range=7-115). Eiders exhibited high site fidelity to wintering areas, with 83% of birds with active transmitters (n=23) returning to the study area the following winter (2012-2013). Mean individual core use home ranges on wintering grounds averaged 38.5km(2) and 95% utilization distributions were 199.3km(2). Based on habitat selection models, eiders preferred shallow, nearshore waters that had relatively fine sediments and a high probability of hard bottom. We estimated that only 3% of our 6,212-km(2) study area had a high relative probability of use by eiders. Future development (e.g., offshore wind energy developments) should avoid shallow, nearshore waters with hard bottoms preferred by eiders to minimize potential impacts. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society.Adult female common eider exhibited strong site fidelity to shallow, nearshore waters in southern New England that had relatively fine sediments and a high probability of hard bottom. Only a small percentage of nearshore waters provided high-quality habitat for eiders and these areas should be avoided when planning marine construction projects, such as offshore wind energy facilities.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,14,0,18,,,0022-541X,1937-2817,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USARhode Isl Dept Environm Management, Div Fish & Wildlife, West Kingston, RI 02892 USA",Rhode Isl Dept Environm Management,,,2017-09-11,WOS:000408485500016,,,,,

This paper is one of the first studies focusing on coastal spatial mobility strategies to improve living standards adopted by fisherfolk in sub-Saharan Africa. It examines how fisherfolk livelihoods have been affected by the extraction and production of oil. The study further explores the various livelihood strategies deployed by fisherfolk to avoid decrease fish catch. A mixed- methods approach made up of 400 fisherfolk households survey and 42 interviews with stakeholders in the fisheries and the petroleum industries were conducted. The study shows that fisherfolk in the Western Region of Ghana are under high socioeconomic vulnerability because of decreased fish catch and declining coastal livelihoods. The spatial restriction of fishers' mobility offshore, the destruction and confiscation of fishing gear, the presence of seaweed in the ocean, and the lack of land opportunities are some of the key petroleum-induced stressors on fisheries livelihoods. The various in situ marine-based adaptation strategies deployed by fisherfolk, especially illegal light fishing and fishing around oil rigs, are unsustainable and are counterproductive in the rebuilding of depleted marine fish stocks.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,2,0,18,,,2214-790X,2214-7918,,,,,,,,,,"Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Geog, Coll Social Sci, 1 Gwanak Ru, Seoul 08826, South Korea",,,,2019-12-23,WOS:000501572400026,,,,,

However, the natural variability of pCO(2) and pH in those habitats remains understudied, especially in temperate areas. In this study we investigated temporal variations of the carbonate system in nearshore macrophyte meadows of the western Baltic Sea. These are key benthic ecosystems, providing spawning and nursery areas as well as food to numerous commercially important species. In situ pCO(2), pH (total scale), salinity and PAR irradiance were measured with a continuous recording sensor package dropped in a shallow macrophyte meadow (Eckernforde bay, western Baltic Sea) during three different weeks in July (pCO(2) and PAR only), August and September 2011. The mean (+/- SD) pCO(2) in July was 3836117 mu atm. The mean (+/- SD) pCO(2) and pH(tot) in August were 239 +/- 20 mu atm and 8.22 +/- 0.1, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) pCO(2) and pH(tot) in September were 1082 +/- 711 mu atm and 7.83 +/- 0.40, respectively. Daily variations of pCO(2) due to photosynthesis and respiration (difference between daily maximum and minimum) were of the same order of magnitude: 281 +/- 88 mu atm, 219 +/- 89 mu atm and 1488 +/- 574 mu atm in July, August and September respectively. The observed variations of pCO(2) were explained through a statistical model considering wind direction and speed together with PAR irradiance. At a time scale of days to weeks, local upwelling of elevated pCO(2) water masses with offshore winds drives the variation. Within days, primary production is responsible. The results demonstrate the high variability of the carbonate system in nearshore macrophyte meadows depending on meteorology and biological activities. We highlight the need to incorporate these variations in future pCO(2) scenarios and experimental designs for nearshore habitats.",,,,,,,,,89,3,0,0,68,0,95,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Benthic Ecol Grp, Kiel, Schleswig Holst, GermanyNIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Yerseke, Zeeland, NetherlandsCONTROS Syst & Solut GmbH, Kiel, Schleswig Holst, Germany",CONTROS Syst & Solut GmbH,,,2013-05-29,WOS:000318008400213,23626849,,,,

This reef complex is formed by an extensive coralline structure with great biological richness and diversity of species. These colonies are considered highly valuable ecologically, economically, socially and culturally, and they also inherently provide biological services. Fishing and scuba diving have been the main economic activities in this area for decades. However, in recent years, there has been a bleaching process and a decrease of the coral colonies in Quintana Roo, Mexico. This drop is caused mainly by the production activities performed in the oil platforms and the presence of hurricanes among other climatic events. The deterioration of the reef system can be analyzed synoptically using remote sensing. Thanks to this type of analysis, it is possible to have updated information of the reef conditions.In this paper, satellite imagery in Landsat TM and SPOT 5 is applied in the coralline reefs classification in the 19802006 time period. Thus, an integral analysis of the optical components of the water surrounding the coralline reefs, such as on phytoplankton, sediments, yellow substance and even on the same water adjacent to the coral colonies, is performed. The use of a texture algorithm (Markov Random Field) was a key tool for their identification. This algorithm, does not limit itself to image segmentation, but also works on edge detection. In future work the multitemporal analysis of the results will determine the deterioration degree of these habitats and the conservation status of the coralline areas.",,,,,"Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems and Hydrology XI as Part of the 16th International Symposium on Remote SensingConference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems and Hydrology XI as Part of the 16th International Symposium on Remote Sensing","AUG 31-SEP 03, 2009AUG 31-SEP 03, 2009",SPIE EuropeSPIE Europe,"Berlin, GERMANYBerlin, GERMANY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0277-786X,1996-756X,978-0-8194-7777-4,,,,,,,,,"Ctr Invest Geog & Geomat Ing Jorge L Tamayo Ctr G, Mexico City 14240, DF, Mexico",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000313294600016,,,,,

It has been proposed that carbonate growth results in self-sealing, but little is known regarding the evolution of cold seep structures in relation to fluid migration pathways. This study investigates structures resulting from gas seepage along ring faults peripheral to Venere mud volcano (1600 m water depth), based on multibeam bathymetry and seafloor backscatter data collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle, together with photomosaics, video observations, and samples obtained by a remotely operated vehicle. Sites of focused fluid flow are identified by gas bubble streams rising from the seafloor while anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) over wider areas is indicated by the occurrence of chemosynthesis-based organisms (microbial mats, vesicomyid clams, vestimentiferan tube worms). At some sites, flakes of gas hydrate were observed in the water column during sampling. A range of carbonate structures exists at these sites: 1) flat and extensive pavements; 2) mounds with disseminated nodules or centimeter-thick crusts; 3) fractured mounds with exposed, decimeter-thick crusts; and 4) seafloor depressions lined by decimeter-thick crusts. The mineralogy and stable carbon isotopic compositions of the carbonates are consistent with anaerobic oxidation of methane from thermogenic sources, and possible near-seabed influence of gas hydrate formation and dissolution. The seafloor expressions of seepage are inferred to be controlled by the interaction of fluid flow due to carbonate precipitation and gas hydrate formation. A conceptual model for mound development is proposed in the context of the known timescales of seep-colonization and rates of carbonate precipitation: (A) the onset of hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage through hemipelagic sediments leads to (B) the establishment of microbial mats on flat seafloor over decadal timescales and is followed by (C) the growth of pavements cemented by carbonates that seal the seafloor; over longer timescales (centuries to millennia), carbonate growth and subsurface gas hydrate formation/dissolution lead to (D) upward doming and fracturing of carbonate mounds, re-sealing and stacking of carbonates and in some cases to (E) their collapse to form seafloor depressions. Gas migration through fractures in the carbonates allows re-sealing and fuels AOM to provide habitats for chemosynthesis-based fauna. This evolutionary scenario is argued to be broadly applicable to the development of ruptured mounds and collapse features described at other seepage sites in the Mediterranean Sea and elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,25,2,0,0,4,0,28,,,0967-0637,1879-0119,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, Klagenfurter Str, D-28359 Bremen, GermanyUniv Bremen, Dept Geosci, Klagenfurter Str, D-28359 Bremen, GermanyIst Nazl Oceanog & Geofis Sperimentale, OGS, Borgo Grotto Gigante 42-C, I-34010 Trieste, ItalyOregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, 104 CEOAS Adm Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 USAPontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Petr & Nat Resources, Av Ipiranga 6681, BR-90619900 Porto Alegre, RS, BrazilGeoazur, CNRS UMR7329, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France",,,,2018-07-01,WOS:000438003300008,,,,,

Our study provides some support for this oxygen limitation hypothesis, with larger body sizes being generally more sensitive to O-2 reductions than smaller body sizes. However, it also suggests that the overall picture is a little more complex. We tested predictions from three different, but overlapping, O-2-related hypotheses accounting for gigantism, using four Antarctic amphipod species encompassing a wide range of body sizes. We found a significant effect of body size, but also of species, in their respiratory responses to acutely declining O-2 tensions. The more active lifestyle of intermediate-sized Prostebbingia brevicornis was supported by a better respiratory performance than predicted by the oxygen limitation hypothesis alone, but consistent with the symmorphosis hypothesis. We suggest that giant polar amphipods are likely to be some of the first to fare badly in an O-2-poor ocean. However, the products of past evolutionary innovation, such as respiratory pigments that enhance O-2-transport and novel gas exchange structures, may in some species offset any respiratory disadvantages of either large or small body size.This article is part of the theme issue 'Physiological diversity, biodiversity patterns and global climate change: testing key hypotheses involving temperature and oxygen'.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,7,0,8,,,0962-8436,1471-2970,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Plymouth, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandBritish Antarctic Survey, Nat Environm Res Council, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England",,,,2019-07-16,WOS:000473329200010,31203754,,,,

Using poststructuralist discourse theory, the article analyses the politics of a proposed offshore wind energy project in Estonia within the context of the country's marine spatial planning processes. First, through the lens of politicization, it explores the strategies of political mobilization and the rival discourses of expertise and sustainability through which residents and municipal actors have contested the offshore wind energy project. Secondly, through the lens of depoliticization, it explains the discursive and legalistic strategies employed by developers, planners and an Administrative Court to displace - spatially and temporally - the core issues of contestation, thus legitimizing the offshore wind energy plan. We argue that the spaces created by the pre-planning conjuncture offered the most conducive conditions for residents to voice concerns about the proposed project in a dialogical fashion, whereas the marine spatial planning and post-planning phases became mired in a therapeutic-style consultation, set alongside rigid and unreflexive interpretations and applications of legality.

A study was conducted in the German North Sea, using passive acoustic monitoring and to some extent simultaneous aerial surveying to specifically study the spatial extent of the deterrence effects of a seal scarer on harbour porpoises. In order to link porpoise detections at various distances to actual sound levels, sound measurements of the seal scarer signal were carried out at several distances from the source. C-POD recordings revealed a significant deterrence effect on harbour porpoises up to 7.5 km away (at about 113 dB re 1 Parms), much further than previously reported. During seal scarer operation the number of porpoise detections within 750 m of the C-PODs decreased by between 52 and 95% of the value before the seal scarer was activated. An aerial survey revealed a significant decrease in porpoise density from 2.4 porpoises km-2 before to 0.3 porpoises km-2 during seal scarer operation within the 990 km2 study area, showing that the decrease in porpoise detections by passive acoustic monitoring was probably indeed the result of a decrease in porpoise abundance. These results may raise serious concerns about unwanted disturbance effects on harbour porpoises in the context of seal scarer use at fish farms and also highlight the need for caution when applied as a mitigation measure during offshore construction.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,31,0,34,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,,,,,,,"BioConsult SH, D-25813 Husum, GermanyInst Tech & Appl Phys Itap, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",BioConsult SHInst Tech & Appl Phys Itap,,,2013-05-29,WOS:000317678300007,,,,,

Small quantities of oil (i.e., 10 ml) results in often lethally reduced thermoregulation in seabirds. Thin sheens of oil and drilling fluids form around offshore petroleum production structures from currently permissible operational discharges of hydrocarbons. Methodology was developed to measure feather microstructure impacts (amalgamation index or Al) associated with sheen exposure. We collected feather samples from two common North Atlantic species of seabirds; Common Murres (Uria aalge) and Dovekies (Alle alle). Impacts were compared after feather exposure to crude oil and synthetic lubricant sheens of varying thicknesses. Feather weight and microstructure changed significantly for both species after exposure to thin sheens of crude oil and synthetic drilling fluids. Thus, seabirds may be impacted by thin sheens forming around offshore petroleum production facilities from discharged produced water containing currently admissible concentrations of hydrocarbons.

The model was applied to an enclosed bay located in the western part of Japan, where eutrophication and associated onset of hypoxia at the bottom waters would occur in every summer. A field survey of fish behavior under hypoxic and non-hypoxic waters was conducted by releasing marbled sale in the bay and tracked its movement. At the same time, vertical profiles of DO, salinity and water temperature were measured at every 0.5m vertical interval at several locations along the tracking path of fish. Moreover, a series of preference tests for DO, salinity and temperature in the laboratory were conducted in order to decide preference parameters of fish. The model could simulate reasonably the observed behavior and movement of the fish under both hypoxic and non-hypoxic waters in the bay; thereby, validated its applicability. Using the model, an assessment of the impact of the ongoing land reclamation project of about 400 ha in the bay on the fisheries resources was also conducted. The results showed that a substantial mortality of the fisheries resources would take place when hypoxic condition occurs in every summer and the construction of the artificial land will lower the mortality rate of fish during the summer period in the bay. Strong offshore winds cause the upwelling of bottom hypoxic waters in summer and the initial mortality of the fisheries resources increase under northerly offshore wind of 5 m/s or more.

One example is the problem of wildlife collisions with vehicles or human-built structures (e.g., power lines, wind farms). In fact, collisions between marine wildlife and watercraft are among the major threats faced by several endangered species of marine mammals. Natural resource managers are therefore interested in finding cost-effective solutions to mitigate these threats.We combined abundance estimators with encounter rate theory to estimate relative lethal collision risk of the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) from watercraft. We first modelled seasonal abundance of watercraft and manatees using a Bayesian analysis of aerial survey count data. We then modelled relative lethal collision risk in space and across seasons. Finally, we applied decision analysis and Linear Integer Programming to determine the optimal design of speed zones in terms of relative risk to manatees and costs to waterway users. We used a Pareto efficient frontier approach to evaluate the performance of alternative zones, which included additional practical considerations (e.g., spatial aggregation of speed zones) in relation to the optimal zone configurations.Under the various relationships for probability of death given strike speed that we considered, the current speed zones reduced the relative lethal collision risk by an average of 51.5% to 70.0% compared to the scenario in which all speed regulations were removed (i.e., the no-protection scenario). We identified optimal zones and near-optimal zones with additional management considerations that improved upon the current zones in terms of cost or relative risk.Policy implications. Our analytical framework combines encounter rate theory and decision analysis to quantify the effectiveness of speed zones in protecting manatees while accounting for uncertainty. Our approach can be used to optimize the design of protection zones intended to reduce conflicts between human waterborne activity and marine mammals. This framework could be extended to address many other problems of human-wildlife interactions, such as the optimal placement of wind farms to minimize collisions with wildlife or the optimal allocation of ranger effort to mitigate poaching threats.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,12,0,18,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USAUS Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL USAINRA 97170, Zootechn Researchers URZ, UR143, Petit Bourg, French West Ind, FranceFlorida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL USAUniv Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USAUS Fish & Wildlife Serv, Jacksonville, FL USAFlorida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Gainesville, FL USA",,,,2019-05-01,WOS:000471343200003,,,,,

Attempts to maintain and restore marine biodiversity are becoming more spatial, principally through the designation of marine protected areas (MPAs). MPAs compete for space with other uses, and the emergence of new industries, such as marine renewable energy generation, will increase competition for space. Decision makers require guidance on how to zone the ocean to conserve biodiversity, mitigate conflict and accommodate multiple uses. Here we used empirical data and freely available planning software to identified priority areas for multiple ocean zones, which incorporate goals for biodiversity conservation, two types of renewable energy, and three types of fishing. We developed an approached to evaluate trade-offs between industries and we investigated the impacts of co-locating some fishing activities within renewable energy sites. We observed non-linear trade-offs between industries. We also found that different subsectors within those industries experienced very different trade-off curves. Incorporating co-location resulted in significant reductions in cost to the fishing industry, including fisheries that were not co-located. Co-location also altered the optimal location of renewable energy zones with planning solutions. Our findings have broad implications for ocean zoning and marine spatial planning. In particular, they highlight the need to include industry subsectors when assessing trade-offs and they stress the importance of considering co-location opportunities from the outset. Our research reinforces the need for multi-industry ocean-zoning and demonstrates how it can be undertaken within the framework of strategic conservation planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The fouling, or mussel weights, of the two platforms were similar for the two seasons, even though the highest values were registered in September on PCWA (1 m) with 1561.3g/dm(2), of which 1553g/dm(2) comprised mussels.

For numerous marine bird species, only recent or sparse monitoring data are available, lacking the appropriate temporal perspective needed to consider natural, long-term population dynamics when developing conservation strategies. Here, we use a combination of established palaeoenvironmental approaches to examine the centennial-scale dynamics of the world's largest colony (representing approx. 50% of the global population) of the declining and vulnerable Leach's Storm-petrel (Hydrobates leucorhous). By reconstructing the last approximately 1700 years of the colony's population trends, we corroborate recent surveys indicating rapid declines since the 1980s. More surprisingly, however, was that the colony size was smaller and has changed strikingly in the past, even prior to the introduction of human stressors. Our results challenge notions that very large colonies are generally stable in the absence of anthropogenic pressures and speak to an increasingly pressing need to better understand inter-colony movement and recruitment when inferring range- and species-wide trends. While the recently documented decline in storm-petrels clearly warrants conservation concern, we show that colony size was consistently much lower in the past and changed markedly in the absence of major anthropogenic activity.

To reach the given target a huge growth in renewable energy is necessary. One of the most potential possibilities to produce renewable energy in Germany will be the installation of offshore wind turbines.During the installation of offshore wind foundations such as monopiles, tripods, tripiles and jackets, mostly large tubular steel piles are impact driven to final penetration depth. In the process of impact driving, considerable underwater sound emissions will appear. In recent times, peak sound pressure levels above 190 dB re 1 mu Pa have been measured at a distance of 750 m away from the installation ground. These peak sound pressure levels, produced during the installation of any kind of driven offshore foundation, is potentially harmful to marine life, in particular to marine mammals such as harbor porpoises, harbor seals or grey seals.To protect the marine life the German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) set the maximum allowed underwater sound pressure level to 160 dB (SEL) at a distance of 750 m away from pile driving.To reach the given target by the BSH a new underwater piling noise mitigation system using so called hydro sound dampers (HSD) is presently developed at the Institute for Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering at the Technische Universitat in Braunschweig (IGB-TUBS). After small scale tests in the so called 'large wave channel' in Hannover a full scale test was performed in the Baltic-Sea some weeks ago.The results of the measurements are very promising, as a reduction of 12 up to 20 dB could be generated. Besides existing noise mitigation systems one of the main advantage of the hydro sound dampers is, that the mitigation can be pre-adjusted to a predefined frequency range, as marine mammals are sensitive only for a certain sound frequency range.In this paper, the results of the small and large scale tests and some new research findings concerning the shape and the material of the hydro sound dampers will be presented.",,,,,"31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUL 01-06, 2012JUL 01-06, 2012","Petrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivPetrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4491-5,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Soil Mech & Fdn Engn, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany",,,,2013-11-14,WOS:000324655900023,,,,,

The performance of offshore drilling services also varied, having been heavily influenced by the 2014 oil price declines.

To assess the range of hydrographic conditions controlling oxygen distribution in the bottom layers of sand pits, a multi-year oceanographic survey has been conducted in a coastal area with several extraction pits. Hydrographic data including profiles of temperature, salinity and oxygen were collected and related to local wind conditions and circulation. Moreover, 1D and 3D high-resolution non-hydrostatic ocean models were used to describe turbulent mixing regimes and to obtain the range of wind speeds for which the critical anoxic conditions may occur. It is shown that wind speed appears to control the dynamics of oxygen concentrations, with oxygen depleted zones developing in a short time in low wind speed conditions. Moreover, the depth and the shape of the extraction pit contribute to decrease the mixing of the bottom layers and increase the water retention in the hole increasing the output and the persistence of oxygen depleted zones in the excavated area. The results of the numerical simulations show that the risk of hypoxia at the bottom of the sand pits is associated with higher temperatures and wind speed lower than 5 m/s, which is not infrequent during the summer season.

This sampling revealed that the petroleum had affected the structure and abundance of this community, as well as the number of taxa present. In this context, the results of the biotic index and the biotic coefficient were insufficient; however, study of the synthetic parameters, particularly through multivariate analysis, showed that the community went through three successive and distinct phases over time. A short period of high mortality in some species, especially amphipods, was followed by a period of low abundance that lasted until the spring of 1995. A period of recovery began in the second half of 1995 and continued through to the end of 1996, when the survey ended. The community showed a gradual evolution back towards the conditions observed immediately after the spill, when abundance of the more resistant species was still high. Despite this similarity, the last period exhibits a new structure, clearly separate from the two previous periods. This study provides information about the short-term effects of the Aegean Sea oil spill on the fine sand bottoms of the sites surveyed in the Ares-Betanzos Ria. This information could also serve as a baseline for identifying the effects of a more recent accident, the Prestige oil spill, in which similar communities in other Galician rias were polluted in 2002-2003.

Geotechnical site investigation and foundation design are critical, and often costly, aspects of offshore development, however are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with design forces from the dynamic ocean environment and heterogeneous seafloor geology. Consequently, geotechnical issues have been a key factor in delays and cost overruns for some European offshore wind farms. This research seeks to reduce barriers to offshore renewable energy development associated with design and construction of foundation systems for floating technologies such as tidal, wave, ocean current, and deep water wind through advancement of a novel integrated foundation system for multi-device developments. This novel system is comprised of a network of interconnected suction caissons, which are large diameter, hollow cylinder, closed cap, pile-type foundations named for their installation by internal underpressure (i.e., suction) developed during pumping of water from the gap formed between the seafloor and cap. When used in an interconnected network to moor multiple devices, suction caissons have the potential to significantly alleviate development costs by reducing the total number of installed foundations. This goal of this research is develop the basic engineering knowledge necessary to transform the use of offshore suction caissons in clay soils from single to networked, multi-line mooring anchors. This research will lead to development of three dimensional numerical models used to predict ultimate capacity and deformation of a suction caisson under taut, orthogonal multi-line loading. The models will be calibrated/validated using both published literature and results from a physical modeling study of multi-line caisson behavior under monotonic and cyclic loading previously conducted by the principal investigator. The model will be further developed to investigate the effects of vertical load attachment point, number of lines and radial attachment angles, and load inclination with respect to caisson height on predicted capacity. This research effort will result in numerical modeling and analysis tools that will allow for continued investigation of multi-line loaded suction caisson capacity for a variety of offshore applications.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1234847,,,,,,,,University of Maine,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13773764,,,,,

Predicted cumulative sound exposure levels (SELcums) experienced by each seal were compared to different auditory weighting functions and damage thresholds to estimate temporary (TTS) and permanent (PTS) threshold shift occurrence.

Most commonly used for wind resource predictions on land as well as offshore is the WAsP program. It has been validated extensively for sites on land and at the coast. However, due to the lack of suitable measurements there is still a need for further validation for offshore sites. Data from ongoing measurements at prospective wind farm sites in the Danish Baltic Sea region are available now. The wind resources estimated from these measurements are compared to WAsP-predictions. They agree well. The only deviation found is for two sites, which are located at about the same distance, but on different sides of the island Lolland. Here the measurements show a difference in the wind resources, which is not predicted by WAsP. A direction-dependent comparison explains this deviation. Wind speed ratios of several pairs of stations are modeled with WAsP for 12 directional sectors and compared with the measurements. Deviations in the directional wind speed predictions were found to correspond with the length of the sea fetch: For smaller sea fetches WAsP seems to slightly over-predict the wind speed, while for long fetches of more than 30 km an under-prediction is found. An analysis of the Vertical wind speed profiles at three sites indicates that a combination of different effects is responsible for the correlation between sea fetch and model behavior. Effects of atmospheric stability as well as a fetch dependent sea surface roughness have to be taken into account. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Peak abundance reached 1.4 ind m(-2) in 1991 and 10.0 ind m(-2) in 1992. Settlement in 1991 occurred later than usual, possibly due to offshore winds during spring. Mean lengths at approximately one month after settlements were similar in the two years. Later in the season, however, lengths at age were lower in 1992, implying density-dependent growth. In addition, analyses of individual cohorts demonstrated reduced growth of late settlers in 1992. Instantaneous mortality rates (d(-1)) did not differ between the two years.

In Northern Europe, migratory bat species are often detected along the coastline of the Baltic Sea particularly during migration seasons in the spring and autumn. In spite of regular monitoring of bat migration at coastal sites, the overall distribution of migratory bats in Northern Europe and variability between sites and seasons are still very poorly known. In this study we used automated bat detectors to compare the activity of migratory bat species between coastal and inland monitoring sites along the west coast of Finland (61.5-61.9 degrees N, 21.3-22.3 degrees E). Our main goal was to test whether the activity of migratory bat species is associated with the coastline or whether these species also occur inland. Of migratory bat species observations, 98.6% were covered by Pipistrellus nathusii, which was detected at all our monitoring sites. The activity of the species decreased rapidly, with increasing distance from the coastline towards inland, indicating a sharp activity gradient along the coastline of the Baltic Sea. Because the activity of P. nathusii occurred in migration season and no similar spatial pattern was detected among sedentary species, our results suggest that the aggregation of P. nathusii at the coastline is related to migration as such rather than regular foraging behavior of this species. Our study has direct implications to the wind power planning in Northern Europe. Based on our study we conclude that the impact of wind power on both migratory (namely P. nathusii) and sedentary bat species (namely Eptesicus nilssonii) should be taken into account in wind power planning and impact mitigation in Northern Europe, especially if new wind farms are located along the coastline of the Baltic Sea. When the turbines are located further inland, more attention in the planning process should however be given to the sedentary bat E. nilssonii.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,18,0,20,,,1508-1109,1733-5329,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Turku, Ctr Maritime Studies, Brahea Ctr, Pori 28101, FinlandUniv Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Metapopulat Res Ctr, FIN-00014 Helsinki, FinlandUniv Turku, Dept Biol, Turun 20014, FinlandUniv Turku, Biodivers Unit, Turun 20014, Finland",,,,2017-06-01,WOS:000401616000010,,,,,

These oils show increasing biodegradation with depth which is consistent with the microbial activity of Bacteroidetes. Further investigation of these microdolomites and their contents can potentially yield insight into the dynamics and microbial ecology of other hydrate localities.

This applies to both local birds, living at sea, as well as aquatic and terrestrial birds, which regularly cross the sea during migration. Several 10 to 100 million birds cross the North and Baltic Sea during their migration between breeding and wintering quarters. Both Seas lie in the centre of these flyways. Birds are potentially endangered by offshore WEPs due to: (I) collisions with WEPs (bird strike), (2) short term loss of habitat during construction and/or servicing of the plants, (3) long term loss of habitat because of displacement (frightening away) of birds by WEPs, (4) barrier effects on migrants, (5) disruption of ecologically linked units. In order to estimate the potential conflict between the separate parameters, it is essential to know the spatial and temporal distribution of birds as well as details of their behaviour (migration, foraging, influence of weather) and behavioural responses in relation to offshore WEPs and to maintenance vessels (fleeing distance, avoidance manoeuvres, consequences of lighting, collision risk). This project was therefore designed to close gaps in the knowledge on temporal and spatial distribution of mainly migratory birds as well as to obtain more precise information on altitude distribution of migration over the North and Baltic Sea by consulting the literature and applying various field methods. In 2001 we carried out own observations of spring and autumn migration on the islands of Helgoland (North Sea), Fehmarn and Rugen (Baltic Sea), using visual, acoustic and radar methods. Additional data from military large range surveillance radar were analysed in cooperation with the 'Amt fur Geoinformationswesen der Bundeswehr'. The collected data are intended to assess the risk of WEPs for birds as well as to provide a basis for the classification of the conservational significance of the various planning sites. The combined evaluation of all aspects is intended to result in the development of a method to facilitate the assessment of appropriate zones for construction of WEPs taking into account the problem of migratory and resting birds. According to visual standardized observations, birds migrate over the German Bight near Helgoland throughout the year (this probably also applies for the Baltic Sea, although it is not been substantiated by continuous observations within this project). Spring and autumn migration are of similar magnitude with regard to bird numbers. Migration mainly takes place from February to May and from August to November. Standardized seawatching, visual raptor and passerine observations recorded a total of 136.000 individuals belonging to 168 species at the three locations. The migratory intensity varies from day to day. An average of more than 500 birds per hour was recorded at all three sites during the main migratory periods. Raptors, cranes, pigeons, swifts and Dunnock tend to fly primarily at high altitudes (> 50 m). Herons and most song birds fly at mid to high altitude (mainly > 10 m). Whereas divers, gannets, cormorants, swans, geese, dabbling ducks, diving ducks, waders, gulls, terns and swallows fly mainly between 5 to 10 m and grebes, petrels, seaducks, mergansers, skuas and auks below 10 m. The altitude of migration decreases with increasing wind force and headwinds. Dabbling ducks and terns almost exclusively maintained a distance of at least 500 m from the coast. This behaviour was even more pronounced in divers, seaducks and auks, where the distance to the coast usually exceeded 2 km. These species are expected to show particularly strong avoidance manoeuvres when confronted by obstacles. The observations with ship radar showed that migration took place up to altitudes of at least 3.800 m. Since the raw data obtained with ship radars do not yield a quantitative altitude distribution, it was necessary to calculate a conversion equation in order to correct for the distribution of echoes up to an altitude of 1.800 m. According to the radar observations, more than 20 % of all birds migrate at an altitude below 200 m at Helgoland and Ruegen, while more than 30 % fly below this altitude at Fehmarn (taking into account that birds flying immediately above the sea surface cannot be detected by the radar). During spring, migration generally took place at lower altitudes. The migration altitude was lowest during the afternoon hours and increased after sunset to attain the highest values two hours after sunset. Thereafter the altitude again decreased and remained relatively low in the second half of the night. However, between 16% and 25% of all echoes still occurred below 200 m during the night (main period of migration). During rain and headwinds birds clearly migrate at lower altitudes. During spring, the main direction of migration was NE, whereby a large proportion of bird movements took place in the opposite direction, particularly on Helgoland. The autumn migration was usually directed to SW to SSW at all locations. Only on Ruegen there was also a distinct movement in the opposite direction (NNE). On Fehmarn the main flight direction was at right angles to the coast (birds crossing the Fehmarn Belt). It was almost exclusively parallel to the coast of Rugen. The average speeds of migration on all locations differed with season (distinctly faster during spring than in autumn). The military radar confirmed the main direction of migration but also revealed undirected movements on Fehmarn, north of Ruegen and in the Pomeranian Bight during the day. These are attributed to foraging birds (gulls, ducks changing between feeding locality). The seasonal course of migratory intensity varies markedly and is characterised by a few days of extremely high activity. Half of all birds pass through within 5% to 10% of the total number of days. The migratory intensity is also subject to strong diurnal variation: The least activity was usually recorded in the afternoon hours, independent of location or season, whereas it increased markedly about one hour after sunset. During the course of the night, until sunrise, the intensity again decreased. The highest activity was observed during tailwinds. During calm conditions and slight headwinds (predominant weather condition) there was also intense migration. During rain, migration was less or commenced later. There was significant accordance in migratory intensity determined with different methods for divers, seaducks, finches and thrushes. This was not the case for gulls and raptors. Despite some disparity, the radar data provide a representative picture of current migration of sea and coastal birds as well as of songbirds. The military radar data confirmed that there is a wide band of intensive migration along the entire coast from the Netherlands up to Denmark. There is also a wide hand of almost equivalent intensity in the Baltic, from Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to Denmark and Sweden. An exception is the migratory activity (presumably of sea ducks and gulls) in the region north of Ruegen and in the Pomeranian Bight. Methods to quantify flight movements, to determine bird strike risk and to assess suited areas for the construction of WEPs, were evaluated. Accordingly, the use of a combination of different techniques (visual, radar and thermal imaging cameras) as well as information on distribution at sea is unavoidable. With regard to the overall assessment of the risk potential displacement and bird strike are the most critical factors. The effects of illumination of WEPs remain unclear. Further research is required in order to obtain improved reliability and estimates of the variability in bird migration presented in this report. This means including more data from more years, improved evaluation of collision risk and finally the impact of WEPs at the population level. There is a need to develop methods to minimize bird strikes and also to improve the understanding of bat migration over the North and-Baltic Seas.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0944-5730,,,,,,,,,,,"Institut fuer Vogelforschung Vogelwarte Helgoland, Inselstation, Postfach 1220, D-27494 Helgoland, Germany",,,,2004-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14112071007,,,,,

The aim of this study is to detect and delineate both the gas hydrate and free gas reservoirs at one of Nyegga's pockmarks. In 2012, a marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) survey was performed at a pockmark in this region, where high-resolution 3-D seismic data were previously collected in 2006. 2-D CSEM inversions were computed using the data acquired by ocean bottom electrical field receivers. Our results, derived from unconstrained and seismically constrained CSEM inversions, suggest the presence of two distinctive resistivity anomalies beneath the pockmark: a shallow vertical anomaly at the underlying pipe structure, likely due to gas hydrate accumulation, and a laterally extensive anomaly attributed to a free gas zone below the base of the gas hydrate stability zone.

Although the wind industry expressed their concerns, the episode has not received much attention from the scientific community and remains weakly understood. In this paper we aim to fill this gap and advance understanding of the underlying processes at seasonal time scales. Using retrospective climate predictions, we find that high sea surface temperatures in the western tropical Pacific ocean associated with a strongly positive phase of the North Pacific Mode played a central role to establish and maintain those wind anomalies. In a more general way it has also been shown that interannual variability of wind speed over North America is not only dominated by El Nino/Southern Oscillation but also by other sea surface temperature variations in the tropical Pacific.

Areas of highest sensitivity are the fishing zones,, coral reefs and marshes, but also spawning grounds, fish breeding zones, fish and oyster farms, ports, sea transport services, beaches and inhabited zones. Special plans, specifying interventions at local, national and international levels, have been established to counter and curb such accidents. In this context, every single, case of pollution, including even the smallest incidents, must thoroughly be, monitored by means of integrated technologies, and all relevant authorities have to be informed about such accidents without delay. In conclusion, it is stressed that the Mediterranean Sea is especially well protected through international cooperation, and that the same level of protection should be afforded to other seas and oceans.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0350-2465,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2010-08-01,WOS:000284029000007,,,,,

To make up for reduced production from maturing fields, oil and gas exploration activities on the Norwegian continental shelf have greatly increased over the past several years. Strict emission controls have resulted in a substantial reduction in the release of hazardous chemicals. However, because of the increased exploration the discharges of water-based drill cuttings and muds have increased substantially, temporarily increasing water column sediment loads. The stony coral Lophelia pertusa is the most widely distributed and well-studied of the structure forming cold water corals (CWC) and it thrives in Norwegian waters where many reefs are located in the vicinity of oil platforms or exploration areas. This species provides habitat for a diverse and abundant assemblage of invertebrates and fishes, including commercially valuable species. High sediment loads are known to negatively affect adult corals, but impacts on the early life history stages are unknown. We investigated the effects of a range of drill cutting concentrations (0.5-640 ppm) on larvae of L. pertusa at ages five days and 15-20 days. One set of experiments was conducted in static experimental chambers that exposed larvae to decreasing concentrations over time, and the other maintained continuous drill cutting concentrations for the duration of the experiment (24 h). Increased sediment load for a duration of 24 h caused significant larval mortality, but there was an age-dependent difference in sensitivity of larvae. Younger larvae were significantly more susceptible to lower concentrations of drill cuttings than older larvae, while the older larvae were significantly more affected at higher concentrations. Five day old larvae were affected at treatment concentration 40 ppm. The larval cilia became clogged, preventing the larvae from swimming actively and ultimately causing mortality. Larvae of many species use cilia for swimming and feeding, so negative impacts of increased sediment may not be limited to corals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

There is also an increasing interest in alternative datasets to evaluate wind seasonal and inter-annual cycles which can be very useful in the initial stages of the design of wind farms in order to identify prospective areas where local measurements can then be applied to determine small-scale variations in the marine wind climate. In this paper we analyse both MERRA2 reanalysis data and measured offshore mast data to determine patterns in wind speed variation and how they change as a function of the distance from the coast. We also identify an empirical expression to estimate wind speed based on the distance from the coast. From the analysis, it was found that the variations of the seasonal cycles seem to be almost independent of the distance to the nearest shore and that they are an order of magnitude larger than the variations of the diurnal cycles. It was concluded that the diurnal variations decreased to less than a half for places located more than 100km from the nearest shore and that the data from the MERRA2 reanalysis grid points give an under-prediction of the average values of wind speed for both the diurnal and seasonal cycles. Finally, even though the two offshore masts were almost the same nearest distance from the coast and were geographically relatively close, they exhibited significantly different behaviour in terms of the strength of their diurnal and seasonal cycles which may be due to the distance from the coast for the prevailing wind direction being quite different for the two sites.",,,,,WindEurope SummitWindEurope Summit,"SEP 27-29, 2016SEP 27-29, 2016",,"Hamburg, GERMANYHamburg, GERMANY",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1742-6588,1742-6596,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Loughborough Univ, Wolfson Sch Mech Elect & Mfg Engn, Ctr Renewable Energy Syst Technol, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000435192700004,,,,,

We examine two marine-based industries that incidentally take migratory birds in Canada: (1) commercial fisheries, through bycatch, and (2) offshore oil and gas exploration, development, and production. We summarize information from the scientific literature and technical reports and also present new information from recently analyzed data to assess the magnitude and scope of mortality. Fisheries bycatch was responsible for the highest levels of incidental take of migratory bird species; estimated combined take in the longline, gillnet, and bottom otter trawl fisheries within the Atlantic, including the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and Pacific regions was 2679 to 45,586 birds per year. For the offshore oil and gas sector, mortality estimates ranged from 188 to 4494 deaths per year due to the discharge of produced waters resulting in oil sheens and collisions with platforms and vessels; however these estimates for the oil and gas sector are based on many untested assumptions. In spite of the uncertainties, we feel levels of mortality from these two industries are unlikely to affect the marine bird community in Canada, but some effects on local populations from bycatch are likely. Further research and monitoring will be required to: (1) better estimate fisheries-related mortality for vulnerable species and populations that may be impacted by local fisheries, (2) determine the effects of oil sheens from produced waters, and attraction to platforms and associated mortality from collisions, sheens, and flaring, so that better estimates of mortality from the offshore oil and gas sector can be obtained, and (3) determine impacts associated with accidental spills, which are not included in our current assessment. With a better understanding of the direct mortality of marine birds from industry, appropriate mitigation and management actions can be implemented. Cooperation from industry for data collection, research to fill knowledge gaps, and implementation of mitigation approaches will all be needed to conserve marine birds in Canada.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cawthron Inst, Coastal & Freshwater Grp, Nelson, New Zealand",,,,2014-06-26,ZOOREC:ZOOR15007033963,,,,,

For known water depth and sediment properties, DCS permits extrapolation from a measurement at a known range. Impact assessment criteria typically involve zero-to-peak sound pressure level (L-p,L-pk), root-mean-square sound pressure level (L-p,L-rms), and cumulative sound exposure level (L-E,L-cum).

Five different types deep-water energy installations with depths ranging from 320 to 995 m, and three shipwrecks with depths ranging from approximately 530 to 615 m, were examined. Density, depth ranges, and growth rates of L. pertusa colonies were calculated from video and image analysis. L pertusa colonies were present on all structures examined. Minimum calculated growth rates for the largest colonies ranged from 0.32 to 3.23 cm/yr on the different structures. The shallowest depth at which L pertusa was observed was 201 m and the deepest was 801 m, considerably expanding the known depth range of this species in the northern GoM. Colony density varied with structure type, age, and depth, with the highest density between 503 and 518 m on the single structure that spanned the entire depth range of occurrence of L pertusa observed in this study. L pertusa colonies growing on thinner and deeper installations appear to have higher colonization rates, i.e. to develop higher densities over a shorter time period, compared to those on shallower and more massive types of installations. However, on average, colonies have slower growth rates on these installations than colonies on more massive, shallower installations (compliant and solid installations). In general, the calculated minimum growth rates were higher on the installations than on the shipwrecks, which were substantially older. A continuum of colony sizes was documented on all installations, suggesting multiple settlement events. L pertusa thickets were observed on the oldest anthropogenic structures, with most of the components of these structures covered by colonies of L pertusa. Brown, orange, and mottled color-variants were documented for the first time in the GoM. All installations examined for this study were colonized by L pertusa and it is likely that most artificial surfaces in appropriate depths in the GoM will be as well. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The microbial structure was significantly affected by soil environmental factors such as pH, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), total nitrogen, and cadmium level. Microbial alpha-diversity was positively correlated with pH but negatively correlated with TPH. Among sampling sites, the community dissimilarities increased with spatial distance. Variation of bacterial community was mostly attributed to simultaneous effects of spatial distance and environmental factors, and purely spatial distance contributed more to the variation. Microbial generalist OTUs were broadly distributed and dominant in contaminated soils. Their populations were in low proportion (15.75%), but they had high relative abundance (65.05%), and some were associated with TPH-degradation. Network analysis indicated that microbial communities had nonrandom co-occurrence patterns. Keystone taxa were Rubrivivax, Nitrospira, Methylotenera, Methyloversatilis and Acidaminobacter. Microbial taxa from the same module had strong ecological linkages and were involved in biological electron-transfer, C and N-cycles, and organic contaminant degradation. Our results indicate that the same microbial groups with TPH-degradation ability can be assembled from indigenous microorganisms in separate regions through long term exposure to contamination.

Cages containing hatchery-reared Atlantic cod Gadus morhua were deployed on expected contamination gradients, along a transect from the River Elbe in the German Bight, and in the vicinity of an oil field in the North Sea (Statfjord). Six weeks later, the cod were retrieved and samples taken for a range of biological effects techniques. In this study, metallothionein (MT) and total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) were measured in liver samples from the caged cod, together with metals (as a measure of bioaccumulation). Both MT and TOSC were highest in cod from the German Bight. In the Statfjord samples MT and TOSC decreased with distance from the oil platform indicating induction in response to anthropogenic sources. The bioavailability of metals appears to be a major factor in MT synthesis, and the measurement of NIT and associated metals is shown to be a useful tool for biological exposure and effects monitoring in pelagic systems. There also appears to be a strong linkage between MT and TOSC levels, indicating overlapping capabilities as stress biomarkers. Results suggest that in addition to its role as a specific indicator of metal exposure, MT in cod could act as a more general biomarker of oxidative stress under certain conditions.

In North America, spatially-explicit abundance estimates of marine birds are necessary to assess potential impacts from planned offshore wind energy developments (OWED). Sea ducks are particularly relevant in this context as populations of most North American species are below historic levels and European studies suggest OWEDs. We modelled species occupancy using a generalized additive model and conditional abundance with generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape; the models were subsequently combined to estimate unconditional abundance. We demonstrate this flexible, model-based approach using sea ducks (Common Eider [Somateria mollissima], Black Scoter [Melanitta americana], Surf Scoter [M. perspicillata], White-winged Scoter [M. deglandi], and Long-tailed Duck [Clangula hyemalis]) in Nantucket Sound, Massachusetts, USA, which supports some of the largest concentrations of wintering sea ducks in eastern North America and where a 454-MW OWED is proposed. Our approach to species distribution and abundance modelling offers several useful features including (1) the ability to model all conditional distribution parameters as a function of covariates, (2) integrated variable reduction and selection among many covariates, (3) integrated model selection, and (4) the efficient incorporation of smooth effects to capture spatiotemporal trends poorly explained by other covariates. This modelling approach should prove useful for marine spatial planners in siting OWEDs while considering key habitats and areas potentially vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors. Moreover, the approach is equally suitable for terrestrial or aquatic systems.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-11-19,PPRN:22749339,,,,,

In order to improve the performance of the turbine at low wind speed, starting time was combined with output power in an objective function and a three-bladed, 2 m diameter rotor was designed and optimized for those regions using a purpose-built genetic algorithm. The Blade-Element Momentum (BEM) theory was employed to calculate the output power and a modified version was used to determine the starting time in the presence of a small, but significant resistive torque. The optimization procedure maximized a combination of the output power in terms of the power coefficient and the starting time. Results show that the performance of a blade optimized for sea level degrades for other locations and that degradation is more important for the starting performance than the power coefficient. In order to improve the performance of the blade at the different altitudes, the optimization process was performed in two steps. First, the geometry of the blade was optimized for the air density at the appropriate altitude that increased both the power coefficient and the starting time. Much more power was achieved using the second step in which the tip speed ratio was optimized along with the geometry of the blade in the optimization procedure. The results highlight the importance of the drive train and generator resistive torque which delays the starting of the wind turbine especially at very high altitudes as the aerodynamic torque is reduced.

Modelling of the hydrodynamic behaviour of the structure is still the subject of wide debate in the technical communities.The assessment of the hydrodynamics of the support structure is not an easy task as the floaters consist of an assembly of columns, braces and pontoons, commonly also with heave plates: each of these components corresponds to a different hydrodynamic model and it further interacts with the other elements. This results in very complex non-linear modeling, which makes it necessary to resort to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods for the evaluation of the combined hydrodynamics.In the framework of the collaboration between the Basque Centre for Applied Mathematics (BCAM) and Tecnalia R&I, the interaction of the sea flow with a semisubmersible floating offshore wind platform have been calculated by using the open source solver Unicorn in the FEniCS-HPC framework when subject to a steady inflow. The prototype of the platform consists in a semi-submersible 4-columns column stabilized platform NAUTILUS Floating Solutions concept-; columns are connected by a rigid ring pontoon provided with heave damping plates at the bottom. The novelty of the approach in FEniCS-HPC hinges upon an implicit formulation for the turbulence, a cheap free slip model of the boundary layer and goal-oriented mesh adaptivity [8, 6, 9, 20, 1].

The biodegradation of crude oil by microorganisms co-incubated from sediments collected from the Penglai 19-3 oil platform, Bohai Sea, China, was examined. The relative susceptibility of the isomers of alkylnaphthalenes, alkylphenanthrenes and alkyldibenzothiophene to biodegradation was also discussed. The results showed that the relative degradation values of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) are 43.56% and 51.29% for sediments with untreated microcosms (S-BR1) and surfactant-treated microcosms (S-BR2), respectively. TPH biodegradation results showed an obvious decrease in saturates (biodegradation rate: 67.85-77.29%) and a slight decrease in aromatics (biodegradation rate: 47.13-57.21%), while no significant difference of resins and asphaltenes was detected. The biodegradation efficiency of alkylnaphthalenes, alkylphenanthrenes and alkyldibenzothiophene for S-BR1 and S-BR2 samples reaches 1.28-84.43% and 42.56-86.67%, respectively. The efficiency of crude oil degradation in sediment with surfactant-treated microcosms cultures added Tween 20, was higher than that in sediment with untreated microcosms.

So any terrorist act may lead to an ecological catastrophe with unpredictable consequences. How may prevention best be accomplished? How can the effects of terrorist acts on marine ecosystems be minimized? How can the marine environment and water resources of the East Mediterranean be protected from great anthropogenic loads connected with the current stage of Globalization? These are the key questions of strategic management. Their solution is impossible without contemporary mathematical methods.

Biotoxic organisms (e.g., Caulerpa), toxic dinoflagellates (e.g., Gambierdiscus and Prorocentrum), and bacterial infection by Streptococcus iniae have been most commonly cited as the etiologic agents associated with coral reef fish epizootics in the Tropical Western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Reports of tumors and related lesions in coral reef fishes are relatively uncommon. A chronic iridoviral disease known as lymphocystis affects angelfish, wrasses, grunts, and many other species that inhabit coral reefs and certain rhabdoviruses are also known to cause mortality in angelfish.

Red snapper management began in 1989; the stock is now showing signs of recovery. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council has been slow to sufficiently reduce catches of the directed fisheries to rebuild the stock in a timely fashion, although compliance with the Magnuson-Stevens Reauthorization Act of 2006 (MSRA) required substantial cuts in the harvest of red snapper beginning in 2007. In our opinion, this could have been avoided if conservative management practices had been adopted earlier. We believe that 'faith-based fisheries' arguments have been used to defer effective management of red snapper in the Gulf, which in turn has strained the relationship between science, management, and stakeholders there. We provide a simple empirical argument and alternate interpretations of a recently published perspective on the historical fishery of red snapper in the Gulf to conclude that the preponderance of evidence used in the agency stock assessment process, and the simple arguments made here, do not support the perspective that the red snapper stock has increased in size sufficiently to defer compliance with the MSRA.",,,,,,,,,88,0,0,0,80,0,112,,,0960-3166,1573-5184,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USANOAA Fisheries, Santa Cruz Labs, SW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA USAUniv W Florida, Dept Biol, Pensacola, FL 32514 USAUniv British Columbia, Fisheries Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, CanadaUniv Florida, Dept Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL USAAquabio Inc, Arlington, MA USAFlorida Inst Technol, Coll Engn, Melbourne, FL 32901 USAUniv Western Sydney, Sch Nat Sci, Syndey, NSW, AustraliaUniv Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USAN Swell Media LLC, Jensen Beach, FL USA",Aquabio IncN Swell Media LLC,,,2011-06-01,WOS:000290577100002,,,,,

As part of the decommissioning process, studies on potential importance of subsea infrastructure to marine megafauna (defined as: cetaceans, pinnipeds, sirenians, large fish - such as sharks, rays, billfishes, and tuna, as well as marine reptiles, and seabirds) are lacking. Dedicated scientific Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) surveys around offshore installations are rare, but there is a wealth of archived industrial data and noteworthy species sightings posted publicly on various social media platforms. This study used routine, incidentally collected ROV (n = 73) and commercial diver (n = 9) video recordings spanning 1998-2019 globally. Data were gathered directly from industrial partners (n = 36) and the public domain (YouTube; n = 46) to provide an account of marine megafauna presence and potential feeding behavior in the near-visible vicinity of subsea anthropogenic structures. A total of 79 video clips and 3 still images of marine megafauna near offshore structures were examined, resulting in 67 individual sightings and 16 sub-sightings (in which an individual was recorded within the same day). At least 178 individuals were identified to a minimum of 17 species of marine megafauna, amounting to a total (combined) sighting duration of 01:09:35 (hh:mm:ss). Results demonstrated proximate presence of marine megafauna (many of which are threatened species) to anthropogenic structures, with most animals displaying foraging or interaction behaviors with the structures. Observations included the deepest (2,779 m) confirmed record of a sleeper shark (Somniosus spp.) and the first confirmed visual evidence of seals following pipelines. These ROV observations demonstrate a latent source of easily accessible information that can expand understanding of marine megafauna interactions with offshore anthropogenic infrastructure.

Here, we present six types of well-preserved MISSs from the upper Sunjiagou Formation and lower Liujiagou Formation of Induan (Early Triassic) age in the Yiyang area, Henan Province, North China. These MISSs include: polygonal sand cracks, worm-like structures, wrinkle structures, sponge pore fabrics, gas domes, and leveled ripple marks. Microanalysis shows that these MISSs are characterized by thin clayey laminae and filamentous mica grains arranged parallel to bedding plane as well as oriented matrix supported quartz grains, which are indicative of biogenic origin. Fades analysis suggests that the MISS-hosting sediments were deposited in a fluvial sedimentary system during the Early Triassic, including lake delta, riverbeds/point bars, and flood plain paleoenvironments. Abundant MISSs from Yiyang indicate that microbes also proliferated in terrestrial ecosystems in the aftermath of the Permian-Triassic (P-Tr) biocrisis, like they behaved in marine ecosystems. Microbial blooms, together with dramatic loss of metazoans, may reflect environmental stress and degradation of terrestrial ecosystems or arid climate immediately after the severe Permian-Triassic ecologic crisis.

Despite this, little is known about the nature of the potential risks posed by such interactions. Here, we performed a multifactorial microcosm experiment to assess the impact of ocean acidification, ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation and oil hydrocarbon contamination on sediment chemistry, the microbial community (composition and function) and biochemical marker response of selected indicator species. We found that increased ocean acidification and oil contamination in the absence of UV-B will significantly alter bacterial composition by, among other things, greatly reducing the relative abundance of Desulfobacterales, known to be important oil hydrocarbon degraders. Along with changes in bacterial composition, we identified concomitant shifts in the composition of oil hydrocarbons in the sediment and an increase in oxidative stress effects on our indicator species. Interestingly, our study identifies UV-B as a critical component in the interaction between these factors, as its presence alleviates harmful effects caused by the combination of reduced pH and oil pollution. The model system used here shows that the interactive effect of reduced pH and oil contamination can adversely affect the structure and functioning of sediment benthic communities, with the potential to exacerbate the toxicity of oil hydrocarbons in marine ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,23,0,26,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3810193 Aveiro, PortugalUniv Aveiro, CESAM, P-3810193 Aveiro, PortugalUniv Aveiro, Dept Phys, P-3810193 Aveiro, PortugalUniv Aveiro, Dept Chem, P-3810193 Aveiro, PortugalUniv Aveiro, QOPNA, P-3810193 Aveiro, PortugalUniv Coimbra, IMAR Inst Mar, P-3001401 Coimbra, PortugalUniv Coimbra, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Dept Life Sci, P-3001401 Coimbra, PortugalUniv Algarve, Ctr Marine Sci CCMAR, P-8005139 Faro, Algarve, PortugalUniv Porto, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, P-4169007 Oporto, PortugalUniv Porto, Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res CIIMA, P-4050123 Oporto, Portugal",,,,2015-05-01,WOS:000353220500011,25382269,,,,

Finite volume and finite difference methods were developed to solve the 3D Helmholtz equation of sound propagation in the coastal environment. For the finite volume method, the grid system consists of triangular grids in the horizontal plane and sigma-layers in the vertical dimension. A 3D sparse matrix solver with complex coefficients was formed for solving the resulting acoustic pressure field. The Complex Shifted Laplacian Preconditioner (CSLP) method was applied to solve the matrix system iteratively with MPI parallelization using a high performance cluster. The sound model was then coupled with the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) for simulating sound propagation generated by human activities in a range-dependent setting, such as offshore wind energy platform construction and tidal stream turbine operations.

Many polymeric composite coatings have proved to be resistant against aggressive environments. Two major applications of ferrous materials are in marine environments and in the oil and gas industry. Knowing the corroding behavior of ferrous-based materials during exposure to these aggressive applications, an effort has been made to protect the material by using polymeric and ceramic-based coatings reinforced with nano materials. Uncoated and coated cast iron pipeline material was investigated during corrosion resistance by employing EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) and electrochemical DC corrosion testing using the three electrode system.

The aim of the survey was to document the distribution and abundance of cetaceans to provide baseline population data for an area that is being increasingly explored and developed by oil companies. A double platform 'independent observer' (IO) method was used to estimate the abundance of the Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus) using standard line-transect and distance sampling methodology. Previously, uncorrected Atlantic white-sided dolphin abundance was estimated as 27,194 (CV=0.29) from this survey. This paper presents abundance estimates corrected for g(0) 1 using a direct duplicate method. The value of g(O) was estimated to be 0.61 (CV = 0.09). The abundance in two strata was estimated as 21,371 (CV = 0.54) to the west of the Outer Hebrides and 74,626 (CV = 0.72) in the Faroe Shetland Channel. The high CVs are the result of small sample sizes, particularly of the duplicate data set. However, the abundance estimates represent the first for this species to the northwest of Scotland and adds to existing baseline abundance estimates for small cetaceans in UK waters. The results could be useful for planning future surveys that aim to calculate more precise abundance estimates. These results, together with opportunistic sightings data collected during other surveys, suggest that the waters to the west of Scotland are an important habitat for the Atlantic white-sided dolphin. Presently, threats to this species in the area are relatively unknown but a baseline population estimate will be an integral part of any management regime should there become a need in future.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,0,5,,,1561-0713,,,,,,,,,,,"Gatty Marine Lab, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, KY16 8LB, UK",,,,2004-03-01,BCI:BCI200400410873,,,,,

To better understand the impact of this wind-power plant on white-tailed eagles, we investigated how habitat utilization affected displacement effects. We collected data on habitat utilization in non-territorial subadult white-tailed eagles using global positioning system satellite telemetry (2004-2009). From these data, we estimated utilization distributions using the Brownian bridge movement model and analyzed them using Resource Utilization Functions. Home ranges were circa 10-30% smaller for subadults hatched on skerries and islets farther from the wind-power plant, and tended to be circa 40% larger during spring. Shallow sea, skerries, and islets were utilized extensively, as was marsh, heathland, and forest on the main island of Smola. We noted lower selectivity for arable land and higher levels of differentiation in utilization among individuals for forest and islets. Females also had a nearly 4 times higher between-individual variation, which was likely due to longranging excursions. The within-and between-individual variation among seasons showed an annual pattern, with increasing between-individual variation toward summer. Displacement (indicated by an overall 40% proportional reduction in utilization) was more pronounced in the birds' second and third calendar year compared with their first calendar year, and during autumn-winter. Reduced displacement during spring coincides with the white-tailed eagle pre-breeding period with increased flight activity. This may, in part, explain increased collision risk during spring. Possible displacement effects in white-tailed eagles may be avoided by siting wind-power plants farther inland or offshore.

The impact from oil production activities on the benthic community structure and shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum and Litopenaeus setiferus) biochemical markers were studied in the Gulf of Mexico, which is heavily contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals. Shrimp were collected from a control area and from an area close to oil production platforms during October and November 2002. There was no spatial difference in exposure and response probably because shrimp migrate, as results did not show significant differences in cytochrome P4501A (as measured by ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase (ECOD) metabolism) between the two sites. In October, shrimp ECOD activities were higher and statistically different from those measured in the samples taken in November. As for ECOD activities, with the concentration of vitellogenin as another biomarker, there were no differences between the shrimp collected from the control area and the shrimp collected on the oil production platforms. In this case the concentrations were higher in shrimp collected in November vs. shrimp collected in October. However, there are significant correlations between contaminants and responses (biomarkers), indicating an effect of pollution. One of the most important considerations brought up by this kind of study is that, although the majority of groups studying the effects of endocrine disruption have focused almost exclusively on human health or vertebrate wildlife-related issues, it is necessary to increase research focused on understanding the function of hormones in invertebrate species exposed in the field to different kinds of pollutants.

To address these questions, late-stage larvae of Synodus foetens, Synodus intermedius, Synodus poeyi, Saurida suspicio and Saurida brasiliensis were collected in replicate light traps in three different reef habitats (back-reef, lagoon and exposed) in the San Blas Archipelago, Panama, over 18 consecutive lunar months. Although replenishment of lizardfish occurred year-round, the temporal and spatial supply patterns were species-specific: S. foetens, S. intermedius and S. poeyi were most abundant during the dry season while S. suspicio and S. brasiliensis were most prevalent during the wet season. When seasons were analysed separately, water temperature explained 39 and 26% of the variance in light trap catches of S. foetens and S. intermedius, respectively, in the dry season while wind-induced turbulence accounted for 25% of the variability in S. suspicio and S. brasiliensis catches during the wet season.

The work presented long term wind data analysis in terms of annual, seasonal and diurnal variations at these sites. The wind speed and wind direction each 3 hours data for a period of 10 years between 2000 and 2009 were used in the analysis. Weibull parameters at different heights has been studied and used to describe the distribution and behavior of wind speed and their frequencies. Wind turbine energy production at different heights has been calculated using a Weibull distribution (Weibull Statistics Techniques). The total energy output per year from the wind machines of different sizes and at different hub heights were compared. This research work revealed that the lower rated speed for the wind energy conversion system (WECS) of the same height, the higher the capacity factor values, in most cases. This work used also a new analytical method of (Spena & Ahwide's method) for the estimation of the available wind energy potential. The results of both previous mentioned method's were compared. Moreover, the expected cost in $ Dollar/kWh for both wind machines have been calculated, which have different characteristics but the same power level of 1650 kW. It was hoped that the data analysis can help to identify good sites in Libya for new wind turbine installations. This evaluation was helpful to trigger the use of large wind turbines at the selected sites along the coasts of Mediterranean. (C) 2013 The Authors.

The impact of these chemical changes depends on the considered organisms. In particular, it depends on the ability of the organism to control the pH of its inner fluids. Among echinoderms, this ability seems to differ significantly according to species or taxa. In the present paper, we investigated the buffer capacity of the coelomic fluid in different echinoderm taxa as well as factors modifying this capacity. Euechinoidea (sea urchins except Cidaroidea) present a very high buffer capacity of the coelomic fluid (from 0.8 to 1.8 mmol kg(-1) SW above that of seawater), while Cidaroidea (other sea urchins), starfish and holothurians have a significantly lower one (from -0.1 to 0.4 mmol kg(-1) SW compared to seawater). We hypothesize that this is linked to the more efficient gas exchange structures present in the three last taxa, whereas Euechinoidea evolved specific buffer systems to compensate lower gas exchange abilities. The constituents of the buffer capacity and the factors influencing it were investigated in the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and the starfish Asterias rubens. Buffer capacity is primarily due to the bicarbonate buffer system of seawater (representing about 63% for sea urchins and 92% for starfish). It is also partly due to coelomocytes present in the coelomic fluid (around 8% for both) and, in P. lividus only, a compound of an apparent size larger than 3 kDa is involved (about 15%). Feeding increased the buffer capacity in P. lividus (to a difference with seawater ;of about 2.3 mmol kg(-1) SW compared to unfed ones who showed a difference of about 0.5 mmol kg(-1) SW) but not in A. rubens (difference with seawater of about 0.2 for both conditions). In P. lividus, decreased seawater pH induced an increase of the buffer capacity of individuals maintained at pH 7.7 to about twice that of the control individuals and, for those at pH 7.4, about three times. This allowed a partial compensation of the coelomic fluid pH for individuals maintained at pH 7.7 but not for those at pH 7.4. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The Cape Hatteras region continues to receive scientific attention as a biogeographic barrier between the Western North Atlantic Warm and Temperate (Carolina) and Boreal provinces, as a zone of high primary productivity and micro-zooplankton grazing, as a source of carbon flux to slope sediments, and as an area of on-going and projected commercial interests. Research projects using the vessel include study of the distribution, abundance, population structure, acoustic ecology, and behavior of pelagic cetaceans in the Hatteras region, the ecological physiology of transparent midwater organisms, and transport mechanisms of commercially important species spawned offshore to inshore nursery grounds and transport of pollutants from offshore activities into sensitive inshore habitats. Broader Impacts Research undertaken from the new vessel will focus on biophysical studies that can be used to inform assessment of environmental impacts across jurisdictional boundaries and inform management and policy decisions. Wind farms, military training activities, fisheries, shipping, oil and gas development, mineral extraction, and living resource protection continue to expand into near-shore and off-shore waters; the vessel will enable studies of the biological consequences of these and other human activities and of the dynamics and processes of pelagic and benthic ecosystems. Near-shore and off-shore research will address national priorities relating to stewardship of natural ocean resources through studies of the abundance, and distribution of marine species (including endangered marine mammals and sea turtles), their relationships to habitats and other species, and the impacts of human activity on these taxa, especially within the context of predictive modeling in response to environmental change. The Marine Laboratory has vigorous undergraduate and graduate training programs and most students in these programs engage in field research with their faculty mentors. Students working on near-shore and offshore studies will be trained in seamanship and at-sea research methods using this vessel.

However, the influence of the waves on the wind profile remains understudied, in particular the momentum transfer between the sea surface and the atmosphere. Previous studies showed that for swell waves it is possible to have increasing wind speeds in case of aligned wind-wave directions. However, the opposite is valid for opposed wind-wave directions, where a decrease in wind velocity is observed. Up to now, this behavior has not been included in most numerical models due to the lack of an appropriate parameterization of the resulting effective roughness length. Using an extensive data set of offshore measurements in the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, we show that the wave roughness length affecting the wind is indeed dependent on the alignment between the wind and wave directions. Moreover, we propose a new roughness length parameterization, taking into account the dependence on alignment, consisting of an enhanced roughness length for increasing misalignment. Using this new roughness length parameterization in numerical models might facilitate a better representation of offshore wind, which is relevant to many applications including offshore wind energy and climate modeling.",,,,,,,,,18,1,0,0,1,0,19,,,1680-7316,1680-7324,,,,,,,,,,"KULeuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Leuven, Belgiumvon Karman Inst Fluid Dynam, Rhode St Genese, BelgiumNatl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USAUniv Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, NorwayBjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, NorwayKULeuven, Dept Civil Engn, Leuven, Belgium",von Karman Inst Fluid Dynam,,,2019-06-04,WOS:000468467000001,,,,,

Specifically, sustainable harvest and take levels based upon PBR with an Allee effect were between approximately 51% and 66% of levels based upon PBR without an Allee effect. Managers and biologists using PBR may need to consider the limitations if an Allee effect may be present in the species being modeled.

The exotic coral was found along a great geographic range of the Canal Central of Ilha Grande, extending over a distance of 25 km. The abundance of Tubastraea was quantified by depth, using three different sampling methods: colony density, Visual estimation and intercept points (100) for percentage of cover. Tubastraea showed ample tolerance to temperature and desiccation since it was found more abundantly in very shallow waters (0.1-0.5 in), despite the fact that hard substratum is were found available at greater depths at all the stations sampled. At most sites, I to 5 colonies per 0.25 m(2) most frequently, but occasionally more than 50 colonies were found per 0.25 1112, indicating a somewhat gregarious spatial distribution for this coral. The coral Tubastraea was found to occupy slopes of every possible angle in the Canal Central of Ilha Grande, but more colonies were found occupying slopes of 80 to 100 degrees. Therefore, its insensitivity to angles of recruitment and its tolerance for different depths makes it an organism with great ecological tolerance, with a potential to colonize new areas and increase its current range in Brazil's coastal waters.",,,,,,,,,65,0,0,0,62,4,70,,,1519-6984,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Lab Celenterol, Dept Invertebrados, Museu Nacl, BR-20940040 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,,,2005-11-01,BCI:BCI200600186215,16532191,,,,

In Brazil, they were first reported from fouling on oil platforms' and have expanded their range along 3,500km of the coastline. The Sun-Coral Project (PCS) was launched in 2006 as an outreach program aimed at the restoring marine ecosystems, mitigating the environmental damage and redressing the social and economic impacts caused to coastal communities by the sun corals. We train collectors to manually remove the corals from the seabed and earn extra income by selling the skeletons, which are used in craftwork sold to tourists. Engaging human coastal communities in management allowed it to contribute to local sustainable development. The aim of this study was to critically evaluate the first ten years of PCS as a management initiative. We 1) analysed the contribution of PCS to scientific knowledge by carrying out a systematic literature search; 2) reviewed the contribution of the regional and community monitoring program to management planning; 3) analysed management results; 4) identified social-economic effects of extra-income; 5) synthesized information regarding the structure of PCS and the role of environmental education, capacity building, training and communication. PCS is structured into training, environmental restoration, extra income and sustainability, communication, monitoring and research programs. Environmental education is present across all programs. A hotline receives new records, a task force is available for first response management and training, a Visitor's Center was created for communication and as a field base, and a National Sun Coral Records Database was created to gather all information. The PCS Database compiled historical records and demonstrated that the sun corals continued to expand along the Brazilian coastline during the study period (2006-2016). PCS's Research, Development and Innovation (R&D&I) Network (14 institutions, 35 members) contributed to knowledge producing 70% of publications dealing with the sun corals in Brazil. Monitoring was able to map distribution and range expansion at 326 monitored sites over four regions. Twenty five different types of outreach actions were identified which directly affected 143,000 people. Two hundred and thirty thousand sun-coral colonies (8.5 T) have been manually removed through 165 control and eradication actions. Eighty six percent of the 22 collectors and their 80 family members said their lives improved due to the extra income.

Single meteorological variables accounted for as much as 59 to 93% of seasonal changes in gull abundance. Gulls (including nonbreeders) delayed dispersal to oceanic waters until onset of winter meteorological conditions, several months after cessation of breeding. Our findings support Woodcock's convective-soaring hypothesis, which ascribed gull dispersal in winter to boundary-layer dynamics along eastern continental margins. We extend this model by linking gull morphology and flight to energy-efficient reliance on air-sea interactions and spatial patterns in seasonal wind fields. Summer meteorological conditions in much of the western North Atlantic Ocean facilitate coastal foraging by gulls, but act to preclude efficient foraging to and in offshore habitats. The presence or absence of coherence (meteorological consistency) in the aerial environment may have acted to select and maintain divergent life-history strategies in gulls and certain other inshore feeders.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,0,11,,,0004-8038,,,,,,,,,,,"N CAROLINA STATE MUSEUM NAT SCI,RALEIGH,NC 27611",N CAROLINA STATE MUSEUM NAT SCI,,,1994-04-01,WOS:A1994NM64100017,,,,,

In both places, recovery caused increased rates of human-crocodile conflict (HCC). Within northern Australia, the crocodile recovery and HCC have been documented over time. In contrast, this has not been the situation in Timor-Leste, where we investigated HCC based on 130 attack records (1996-2014; 52% fatal). In 1996-2006, 0.55 attacks/year were reported in Timor-Leste. By 2007-2014, 9 years later, a 23-fold increase had occurred (13 attacks/year). Traditional subsistence fishing (82.5% of all attack records) is the highest risk activity, followed by bathing (7.5%) and water collecting (4.2%). Although the human population was correlated with crocodile attacks in Timor-Leste, it likely does not explain the dramatic increase in crocodile attacks. Alternatively, crocodile numbers may have increased, either in the remnant resident crocodile population, or via migrants from elsewhere. Permanent crocodile habitat is limited, and limited breeding does not explain the high number of large crocodiles, and consequent increase in attacks in such a short time. A plausible explanation, consistent with traditional knowledge in Timor-Leste, is that the influx of large crocodiles attacking people are migrants from Australia. We examined this possibility from available sources. Within Australia crocodiles have recovered since protection and they regularly invade adjacent habitats, such as Darwin harbor, where they are removed to prevent attacks on people. Saltwater crocodiles have been sighted at oil rigs, in the open ocean, moving between northern Australia and the south coast of Timor-Leste. The likelihood of crocodiles migrating from Australia to Timor-Leste raises obvious conservation, moral, and ethical dilemmas when conserving a large dangerous predator in one country to increase abundance results in dispersal to another country, where the predator attacks and kills people. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.We recorded 130 crocodile attacks between 1996 and 2014 in the Southeast Asian nation of Timor-Leste, located approximately 450km north of Australia. Our results indicated that an increase in the numbers of large saltwater crocodiles is the primary factor driving the accelerating human-crocodile conflict in the country and that dispersing crocodiles from Australia may add to the rapid recovery of the Timorese saltwater crocodile population after protection (2000-2005).",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,13,0,15,,,0022-541X,1937-2817,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Remote Sensing & Landscape Informat Syst, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, GermanyWildlife Management Int, POB 530, Karama, NT 0813, AustraliaCharles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, AustraliaMinist Dev Housing Planning & Environm, Biodivers Directorate, Fomento Bldg,Rua Dom Aleixo Corte Real, Mandarin, Dili, Timor-LesteNatl Univ Timor Leste, Ctr Climate Change & Biodivers, Ave Cidade Lisboa, Dili, Timor-LesteUnited Nations Subreg Off Cent Asia FAO SEC, Food & Agr Org, Ivedik Cad 55, TR-06170 Ankara, Turkey",Wildlife Management IntMinist Dev Housing Planning & EnvironmNatl Univ Timor Leste,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000442501700002,,,,,

Stiffness coupling between bending and twisting modes can be used to improve the aeroelastic performance of such blades. In composite blades bend twist coupling can be achieved by imparting unbalance in the lamination sequence. In the present work, a parametric study has been conducted to study the effect of unbalances in different parts of a wind turbine blade on flutter instability. An eigenvalue-based approach has been used for flutter analysis. It has been observed that flap-torsional stiffness has high impact on critical flutter speed. The critical flutter speed is increased by 40% with flap-torsional stiffness due to the unbalance in the entire section of the blade with symmetric skin, while for asymmetric skin; the achievable increment is 100%.

For surface waters in gas-exchange equilibrium with the atmosphere, models suggest increases in CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) from current values of ca. 390 mu atm to ca. 700-1,000 mu atm by the end of the century. However, in typically unequilibrated coastal hypoxic regions, much higher pCO(2) values can be expected, as heterotrophic degradation of organic material is necessarily related to the production of CO2 (i.e., dissolved inorganic carbon). Here, we provide data and estimates that, even under current conditions, maximum pCO(2) values of 1,700-3,200 mu atm can easily be reached when all oxygen is consumed at salinities between 35 and 20, respectively. Due to the nonlinear nature of the carbonate system, the approximate doubling of seawater pCO(2) in surface waters due to ocean acidification will most strongly affect coastal hypoxic zones as pCO(2) during hypoxia will increase proportionally: we calculate maximum pCO(2) values of ca. 4,500 mu atm at a salinity of 20 (T = 10 A degrees C) and ca. 3,400 mu atm at a salinity of 35 (T = 10 A degrees C) when all oxygen is consumed. Upwelling processes can bring these CO2-enriched waters in contact with shallow water ecosystems and may then affect species performance there as well. We conclude that (1) combined stressor experiments (pCO(2) and pO(2)) are largely missing at the moment and that (2) coastal ocean acidification experimental designs need to be closely adjusted to carbonate system variability within the specific habitat. In general, the worldwide spread of coastal hypoxic zones also simultaneously is a spread of CO2-enriched zones. The magnitude of expected changes in pCO(2) in these regions indicates that coastal systems may be more endangered by future global climate change than previously thought.",,,,,,,,,378,15,0,0,319,0,440,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,,,,,,,"Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res GEOMAR, Kiel, Germany",,,,2013-08-01,WOS:000323066600010,,,,,

This natural phenomenon represents a major economic concern for marine industries, e.g. for ships and vessels, oil and wind-turbine sea-platforms, pipelines, water valves and filters, as it limits the performance of devices, materials and underwater structures and increases the costs related to transport delays, hull maintenance and repair, cleaning and desalination units, corrosion and structure break-down. In the last few decades, many efforts have been spent into developing efficient antifouling (AF) surfaces (coatings) combining advances in materials science and recent knowledge of marine chemistry and biology. However, the extensive use of toxic and harmful compounds in the formulations raised increasing health and environmental concerns leading to stricter regulations which pushed marine industries to search for new AF strategies. This review presents the recent research progress made in green strategies for AF coatings using non-toxic, non-biocide-release based principles for marine applications. The two main approaches, detachment of biofoulants or preventing biofoulants attachment, are reviewed in detail and new promising routes based on amphiphilic, (super) hydrophilic, and topographic (structured) surfaces are highlighted.

Sub-lethal physiological stress was evident (elevated whole body cortisol) only after six weeks in 0.1% or 1% PW, In these fish and those exposed to 1% PW for three weeks similar to 50% gill lamellae were fused at their tips and as a result respiratory and/or ionoregulatory processes were likely to be impaired. Decreased oxygen uptake or the narcotic effects of aromatic hydrocarbons may account for the reduced swimming activity of 1% PW-exposed fish. However, in 0.001% PW, fish increased swimming activity which may partially account for their depressed growth.

Sea floor instability around a pile foundation has attracted much attention among offshore geotechnical engineers. In this paper, a three-dimensional numerical model for wave-seabed-structure interactions is proposed using open field operation and manipulation (OpenFOAM). Unlike previous studies, currents are included in the proposed model and applied to a square cross-section mono-pile foundation. In the model, the flow motion is described by the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation and k-epsilon turbulence model, and the water free surface is tracked using the volume of fluid (VOF) method. Meanwhile, the soil response is determined by the Biot's poro-elastic equation (u-p approximation), in which the accelerations of the soil displacements are included. After the model is validated with the previous laboratory experiments, it is further used to investigate the transient soil response around the square mono-pile foundation. Numerical results demonstrate that the cross-section shape has significant influence on the distribution of wave/current-induced transient pore pressure but little influence on the maximum soil liquefaction depth. On the other hand, both the current velocity and the seabed permeability can greatly affect the maximum soil liquefaction depth and slightly affect the distribution of pore pressure. Furthermore, the cross-section dimension significantly affects both the maximum soil liquefaction depth and the distribution of the pore pressure around a mono-pile foundation.",,,,,,,,,3,3,0,0,0,0,5,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Dept Bridge Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaGriffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld, Australia",,,,2019-06-04,WOS:000466416900013,,,,,

These methods of coupling, which makes it possible to transmit the efforts in pressure from the Eulerian formulation to the Lagrangian formulation and conversely are relatively recent algorithmic developments. The Euler/Lagrange penalty method was successfully used in many scientific and industrial applications: the modeling of the attack of birds on the fuselage of a Jet for the Boeing Corporation, the underwater explosion shaking the oil platforms, the airbag simulation...

In a previous study, the problem has been resolved for North Sinai, South Sinai and Matrouh governorates. Meanwhile, the problem still stands for the Red Sea Governorate. In this region, the population is less than 0.2% of Egypt total population; while its area is more than 20% of Egypt's area, which makes investments difficult to exist. In addition, there is a chain of mountains expanding along the Red Sea shore making the piping works and fuel transportation expensive, especially because of the lack of railways. In addition, the National Electric Grid is also not connected. Fortunately, there are locations where high wind speed is steady all over the year allowing electricity generation by wind, with consequent water production. Among the seawater desalination techniques adapted for remote areas is the mechanical vapor compression desalination system (MVC). The main drawbacks for wind driven units is the variable wind speed. This problem is resolved through a proposed electrical and mechanical system, which is interconnected to the local electrical grid. In the present work the equation for determining the yearly electric power generated from a wind turbine as a function of the wind speed and turbine rotor diameter is obtained. An improved simple realistic working formula for determining the compressor specific work needed for the desalination system has been improved from a previous work by the author. In addition, a correlation for determining the wind driven MVC system water productivity at different design parameters has been deduced, enabling design curves to be obtained. The study has indicated that at the operating evaporator temperature and temperature difference recommended are 50degreesC and 3degreesC respectively. The average prevailing wind speed in these areas is 7 m/s, the system productivities are 203, 398, and 938 m(3)/d, at wind turbine diameters 20, 28 and 43 in respectively. These productivities are adequate for communities around 5 10, 1000 and 2350 capita/unit respectively (for specific water consumption of 400 I/d per capita for domestic, tourism and/or small industries).",,,,,Conference on Desalination Strategies in South Mediterranean CountriesConference on Desalination Strategies in South Mediterranean Countries,"MAY 04-06, 2002MAY 04-06, 2002",European Desalinat Soc; European Union; Alexandria Univ Desalinat Studies & Technol Ctr; UNESCO; Int Water Assoc; Water Sci & Technol Assoc; Middle E Desalinat Res CtrEuropean Desalinat Soc; European Union; Alexandria Univ Desalinat Studies & Technol Ctr; UNESCO; Int Water Assoc; Water Sci & Technol Assoc; Middle E Desalinat Res Ctr,"SHAM EL SHELKH, EGYPTSHAM EL SHELKH, EGYPT",30,3,0,0,0,0,35,,,0011-9164,,,,,,,,,,,"Atom Energy Author, Nucl Res Ctr, Cairo, Egypt",,,,2003-02-10,WOS:000180486800006,,,,,

Instances of social innovation are assessed across three sectors in the Dutch North Sea: the offshore wind energy, the offshore mussel cultivation and the offshore seaweed farming. The assessment shows that, while existing systems of social innovation are favourable to the offshore wind expansions, the barriers to grow for the offshore mussel sector include low willingness to change within the sector, and disadvantageous governmental support to change. The offshore seaweed farming is in a stage of re-organisation of not yet developed regulations, rules and norms for production offshore and enhanced co-operation, with unsure outcomes.

Juveniles are especially at risk from hypoxia because they leave the plankton and transition from pelagic to demersal habitats en masse during summer, when hypoxic conditions peak. We explored the influence of hypoxia on juvenile Red Snapper by examining habitat suitability during years with low (areal extent, <10,000 km(2)), moderate (10,000-19,999 km(2)), and severe (>= 20,000 km(2)) hypoxia through retrospective analyses of groundfish data from the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program. Significant interannual variability in the strength of juvenile recruitment was evident, and in general the weakest recruitment was observed during years of severe hypoxia. The relative abundance of juveniles in shallow (9-46 m) waters off central Louisiana was significantly reduced during years of severe hypoxia; this reduction was generally accompanied by an increase in relative abundance of Red Snapper longitudinally and in deeper waters. Patterns of habitat use during summer months varied in relation to hypoxia severity, with individuals occupying sites that were deeper, colder, and of higher salinity during years of severe hypoxia. Red Snapper also exhibited ontogenetic habitat shifts into deeper, cooler, and higher-salinity waters as fish size increased. In general, Red Snapper populations appear resilient to the broad-scale effects of severe hypoxia, although more localized effects may be in force but not evident because of the many factors affecting survival.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,19,0,23,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USALouisiana Univ Marine Consortium, Chauvin, LA 70344 USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium,,,2015-05-06,WOS:000352726200007,,,,,

Substitute ocean water was applied to the experiment instead ofseawater. In addition, a procedure for nonlinear finite element analysis was improved to estimate the behaviour of wear between links.

These robots have allowed scientists to gain important insights to the distribution of life in different marine habitats in unprecedented detail and understand more about the processes that explain where the animals are found. Marine habitats are under increasing pressure from many different human impacts; e.g. fishing, pollution and mineral resource extraction but NERC's research developing innovative monitoring methods has the potential to help industry to improve environmental data collection and monitoring to mitigate environmental impacts. In this Innovation Partnership project we propose to work with the hydrocarbon company Hurricane Energy Plc. We will spend four months working in the company to explore the use of the latest marine robots and other autonomous systems developed by NERC and NOC as well as commercially available systems to improve the quality of information acquired from environmental surveys. The objective is to exchange knowledge with Hurricane to help increase the quality and efficiency of these surveys. There will be a phase of the project in which we work directly with Hurricane Energy's environmental manager to determine their requirements. This will be followed by a phase in which we propose a series of options based on different types of technology to address their environmental data collection challenges. These will be compared with conventional methods of environmental data collection to enable Hurricane to make informed choices and will include liaison with the industry regulators. The project draws on experience working with industry to incorporate MAS into routine operations and emergency response to oil spills (NE/P013228/1) and environmental monitoring of decommissioned oil and gas infrastructure (NE/P016561/1). It will also make use of real-world experience from scientific AUV and fixed-point observatory use; in particular on the NOC's development of pioneering methods to assess spatial ecology of benthic habitats e.g. NERC AESA project NE/H021787/1 and time-series monitoring of the Haig Fras Marine Protected Area, surveys of Rockall Bank and long-term monitoring at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain through the NERC Sustained Observing Programme. It also gains from NOC's existing collaborative project with Hurricane Energy through their participation in the NOC led SERPENT Project (use of industry remotely operated vehicles during stand-by time for scientific study).This work is particularly relevant and timely as Hurricane Energy develop the Greater Lancaster Area and will begin explooration of the Greater Warwick Area, West of Shetland, UK.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/S009426/1,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15403623,,,,,

This article demonstrates the geographies of threats and examines gaps in law and policy responses. Commonly treated at law, and in fact, as an extension of terrestrial or marine spaces, recognition of air as habitat and related conservation protection is rare. In addition, management is confounded by the dynamic, three-dimensional and indivisible nature of airspace, by wildlife and aircraft mobility, and by temporal features. Regulation of airspace and patterns of spatial activity are dominated by aircraft traffic control and related transport imperatives to the exclusion of wildlife protection. Where strategic planning mechanisms are applied, they are often tied to amorphous definitions of habitat, rely upon terrestrial habitat protection for their expression or are reflected as two-dimensional notations on a map. Recommendations to enhance protection for co-existence include transforming the approach to airspace and adopting integrated, strategic and three-dimensional approaches.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0813-300X,,,,,,,,,,,"Waikato Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Environm Planning Programme, Private Bag 3104, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",,,,2019-12-06,WOS:000497762000008,,,,,

Vogelwarte 49: 9-16.The present work derives from currently undertaken ecological accompanying research at the offshore-windfarm 'alpha ventus', 45 km north of the North Sea island Borkum. Using remote detection techniques and visual observations, we present for the first time since initial data ascertainment in autumn 2003 a complete night's course of a bird mass-migration along with different weather parameters and a directly connected mass collision event at the research platform FINO1 in the night of the 1./2.11.2010. Increasing numbers of migrating birds from northeasterly directions were detected during the early evening of the 1.11.2010 and reached their peak of about 460 radar echoes/h between 19:00 and 20:00 h. Contemporaneous weather changes involving tailwinds changing to direct headwinds, increasing wind velocity and decreasing visibility led the birds to continuously descend to lower heights during the strongest migration period between 19:00 and 1:00 h. From 4:00 h onward, more than 50% of the migrating birds were detected in the lower flight heights of 200 m and below and suggest low-level flights to be a reaction towards sudden bad-weather appearances. Enhanced aggregation of birds in the effected area of FINO1 and operating wind turbines, respectively, increase their potential risk of collision by being drawn to the illuminated structures, and in fact, collisions were detected through video and infrared recordings at FINO1. With 88 birds found dead from the night of the 1./2.11.2010, this event holds fourth position of so far documented mass collision events at FINO1. Because the documentation of such (mass) collision events is generally obfuscated and often methodologically limited, the subsequent assessment of the threat for birds is still unknown. The presented event highlights the daunting quantitative dimensions of casualties with regard to future projected wind turbines.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,6,0,7,,,0049-6650,0049-6650,,,,,,,,,,"Avitec Res GbR, Sachsenring 11, D-27711 Osterholz Scharmbeck, Germany",,,,2011-05-13,BCI:BCI201100306945,,,,,

The overall objective of the project is to assist with the development of Metocean standards for offshore wind farm design, and establish a 100-yr extratropical wind speed and wave height climatology for the specific regions of interest. Specific accomplishments include evaluating and selecting a climatological data base to use for the study, establish a technique for performing the extremal analysis, and generating maps of 100-yr return period wind speeds and wave heights.Measured data from National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and Scripps Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP) offshore stations were used to characterize the storm climate and to assess the strengths and weaknesses of two North Atlantic Ocean hindcasts. Hindcasts under consideration included the 20-yr USACE Wave Information Studies (WIS) with kinematically adjusted storm winds, and a new 30-yr WAVEWATCH III (R) hindcast using National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis Reforecast (CFSRR) winds. Using the latest available techniques for wave spectral partitioning, a sea and swell climatology for the region is presented. Robust error metrics quantify hindcast performance in replicating both the observed wave systems and event peak conditions. Each hindcast product was found to have specific strengths and weaknesses. Although the WIS hindcast is shown to have superior winds, the WIS and NCEP wave hindcast results are mixed. As the NCEP product is presently only available for research purposes, the WIS hindcast was selected for use in computation of the final map products.A total of four extremal analysis techniques were evaluated for assessment of extratropical wind and wave storm data. The Empirical Simulation Technique (EST) provided in [14] employs a life-cycle approach to extreme value analysis. In contrast, the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) [2], Weibull [11], and Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) [22] methods are parametric extrapolations to the data. To evaluate these approaches in our area of interest, extratropical Storm populations were identified at five test stations by applying both Peak over Threshold (POT) and Annual Maximum Series (AMS) techniques (for use with the GEV) to the NCEP 30-yr hindcast which is the longest hindcast currently available. Tropical storms were removed by an automated process linked to the North Atlantic Hurricane Database (HURDAT). The four extremal techniques were applied to the storm populations and comparisons made at the 50- and 100-yr recurrence interval.

However, little is known about the migration phenology and habitat use of black scoters in this portion of their range and this information is necessary to assess potential risks to black scoters during the marine spatial planning process. In this regional black scoter study over 2 winters, we used satellite telemetry and spatial modeling techniques to estimate migratory timing and length of stay, quantify winter home range size and site fidelity between winters, examine key habitat characteristics associated with core-use areas, and map relative probabilities of use across a 3,800-km(2) marine spatial planning area for 2 proposed offshore renewable energy facilities. Black scoters spent nearly 5 months in southern New England, with wide variation among individuals in the size of winter utilization distributions (range 16-12,367 km(2)). Approximately 50% of the tagged birds returned to southern New England during the subsequent winter and had variable fidelity to core-use areas occupied the previous winter. During both winters, black scoter core-use areas were located closer to shore, at shallower water depths, with coarser sediment grain size and higher probability of hard-bottom occurrence relative to available areas. Resource selection functions classified the majority of a nearshore 5-turbine, 34-km(2) renewable energy zone off Block Island as high probability of use by black scoters, whereas an offshore 200-turbine, 667-km(2) federal lease block zone was classified as low to medium-low probability of selection. Wind energy facilities, such as the Block Island site, constructed in relatively shallow (<20m deep), nearshore habitats (<5 km) over hard-bottomed or coarse-sand substrate could displace some foraging black scoters wintering in this region, whereas the larger federal lease block zone located farther offshore is more likely to affect scoters dispersing among core-use areas and during migration between wintering and breeding grounds.

They damage the reputation of several seaside resorts and cause serious economic losses. On the German Baltic coast, jellyfish accumulations are well known, too. Besides population increase due to anthropogenic effects, normal hydrodynamic processes are notable key factors when it comes to jellyfish accumulations. Along German Baltic coastlines, moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) occur most frequently but also stinging lion's mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata) appear regularly, however not as abundant. The objectives of our study were a) to screen when, where, how many and which jellyfish species occur on German Baltic coasts, b) to find the causes for jellyfish accumulations and c) to evaluate how beach visitors perceive native medusae and whether information can influence their perception. Different methods where combined: systematic jellyfish observations in cooperation with lifeguards, investigations of jellyfish abundance in shallow water zones, and interviews with beach visitors. Our results suggest that jellyfish occurrence along the German Baltic coast correlates with offshore wind or shore-parallel wind, which cause upwelling events. In contrast, there is no evidence that frequency of jellyfish occurrence was dependent on water temperature in summer. In regard to tourism, we found that beach visitors who received information about jellyfish stated to feel significantly less bothered by medusae.

However, the degree to which sea otters may actually be affected by human-caused oil spills or exposure to natural oil seeps is currently unknown. Between 2012 and 2014, the U.S. Geological Survey and collaborating agencies conducted a telemetry-based study of sea otters in Santa Barbara channel, in order to provide critical information for resource managers (specifically the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, henceforth BOEM, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, henceforth USFWS) about the spatial ecology, population status, and potential population threats to sea otters in Santa Barbara Channel, with particular reference to exposure to manmade structures and sources of oil and natural gas. Analysis of spatial monitoring data using a Bayesian-based synoptic model allowed for description of sea otter home ranges, identification of hot-spots of use, and insights into habitat selection behavior by male and female sea otters. Important findings included the deeper modal depth preferred by males versus females, strong preferences by both sexes for areas with persistent kelp canopy, and greater use of soft-sediment areas by males. The synoptic model also provided the ability to predict population-level density distribution for each sex in new habitats: by calculating the value of these probability density distributions at the known locations of natural seeps, we were able to identify those seeps with higher potential for sea otter encounters. The relative probability of occurrence at locations near to some seeps was sufficiently high (about 1% likelihood of occurrence for some of our study animals) that one would anticipate occasional encounters. Data on male and female survival, reproductive success, activity budgets, and body condition all indicated that sea otters in Santa Barbara Channel are not resource limited, and thus we would expect to see continued strong population growth in this area. However, the principal cause of death for study animals was lethal bites by white sharks, suggesting that shark bite mortality represents the single biggest threat to continued population growth in the Santa Barbara Channel.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,0196-1497,,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA, 22092, USA",,,,2017-08-31,ZOOREC:ZOOR15309054638,,,,,

Using vertical and horizontal mounted marine radars, raptor stand watch observations, and portable handheld weather stations, we studied how temperature, cloud cover, barometric pressure, wind direction, and wind speed affected avian passage rates and height of migrants over 3 ridges (Wartenbe, North Dokie, and South Dokie) being developed for wind energy in northern British Columbia. Using an Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), we determined that a reduced model combining wind speed, barometric pressure, and cloud cover was best at explaining and predicting higher passage rates (expressed as no. birds/hr) in the fall migration for both diurnal and nocturnal migrants. Wind speed proved the most important predictor of passage rates for spring nocturnal migrants and a combination of cloud cover, temperature, and wind direction for diurnal spring migrants. Wind speed also predicted decreases in flight altitude among nocturnal migrants but increased altitude in diurnal migrants. This information coupled with migration timing and topographical areas of higher migrant activity can be useful to wind energy proponents who wish to mitigate collision risk with migrating birds.

We examine two marine-based industries that incidentally take migratory birds in Canada: (1) commercial fisheries, through bycatch, and (2) offshore oil and gas exploration, development, and production. We summarize information from the scientific literature and technical reports and also present new information from recently analyzed data to assess the magnitude and scope of mortality. Fisheries bycatch was responsible for the highest levels of incidental take of migratory bird species; estimated combined take in the longline, gillnet, and bottom otter trawl fisheries within the Atlantic, including the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and Pacific regions was 2679 to 45,586 birds per year. For the offshore oil and gas sector, mortality estimates ranged from 188 to 4494 deaths per year due to the discharge of produced waters resulting in oil sheens and collisions with platforms and vessels; however these estimates for the oil and gas sector are based on many untested assumptions. In spite of the uncertainties, we feel levels of mortality from these two industries are unlikely to affect the marine bird community in Canada, but some effects on local populations from bycatch are likely. Further research and monitoring will be required to: (1) better estimate fisheries-related mortality for vulnerable species and populations that may be impacted by local fisheries, (2) determine the effects of oil sheens from produced waters, and attraction to platforms and associated mortality from collisions, sheens, and flaring, so that better estimates of mortality from the offshore oil and gas sector can be obtained, and (3) determine impacts associated with accidental spills, which are not included in our current assessment. With a better understanding of the direct mortality of marine birds from industry, appropriate mitigation and management actions can be implemented. Cooperation from industry for data collection, research to fill knowledge gaps, and implementation of mitigation approaches will all be needed to conserve marine birds in Canada.",,,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,33,0,40,,,1712-6568,,,,,,,,,,,"Cawthron Inst, Coastal & Freshwater Grp, Nelson, New ZealandMem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF A1C 5S7, CanadaYork Univ, Fac Environm Studies, N York, ON M3J 1P3, CanadaBedford Inst Oceanog, Dept Fisheries & Oceans, Populat Ecol Div, Bedford, England",,,,2013-12-01,WOS:000329315700004,,,,,

The marsh sediment was incubated under an anaerobic condition with exposure to the crude oil or/and dispersant. The experiments were conducted in two continuous phases of nitrate addition to study denitrification potential using acetylene blockage technique and organic matter mineralization potential indicated by CO2 production in the sediment. Results show that the oil slightly (with no statistical significance p > 0.05) increased both the denitrification and organic matter mineralization activities, likely due to oil components serving as additional organic matter. In contrast, the dispersant significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited denitrification, but stimulated organic matter mineralization activities in the sediment due to unknown mechanisms. As a consequence, redox potentials (Eh) were much lower in the dispersant treated systems. The ecological impacts from the dispersant exposure may come from two fronts. First, loss of organic matter from the coastal marsh will threaten the long-term stability of the ecosystem, and the decrease in denitrification activity will weaken the N removal efficiency. Secondly, more reducing conditions developed by the dispersant exposure will likely preserve the oil in the ecosystem for an extended period of time due to weaker oil biodegradation under anaerobic conditions.

Submarine cables that transmit the energy produced from offshore farms all the way to onshore stations are critical structures that must be able to work perfectly over 20 years without any maintenance. In order to reduce the significant costs associated with electrical cables, it is important to optimize the dimensioning of the components of these cables, or to develop structural monitoring techniques that target zero and/or minimum maintenance over their lifespan. In this paper, we FEM of the impact of damage mechanisms of the conductor part of a submarine power phase on its mechanical, electrical, and thermal behavior. The main damage mechanisms are local plasticity and wire failure. The first mechanical study made it possible to obtain the elasto-plastic behavior of the conductor. The electrical study took into consideration the deformed geometry of the conductor in the elasto-plastic domain, as well as the non-homogeneous distribution of the electrical conductivity of the conductor. Their influence on the electrical resistance of the conductor was then analyzed. Finally, we studied the impact of plasticity and conductor failure on the thermal behavior of the phase. The temperature differences obtained in the numerical analysis of this work may be used further to help preventive and curative maintenance of the cables, for example, by using an optical fiber as sensor for structural health monitoring.",,,,,,,,,9,1,0,0,0,0,10,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,,"PRES LUNAM IFSTTAR, CS4 Route Bouaye, F-44344 Bouguenais, France",,,,2019-05-27,WOS:000465616800030,,,,,

The Deep water Horizon spill was predicted to have catastrophic consequences for nearshore fishes, but field studies indicate resilience in populations and communities. Previous research indicates many marsh fishes exhibit avoidance of oil contaminated areas, representing one potential mechanism for this resilience. Here, we test whether prior oil exposure of Gulf killifish Fundulus grandis alters this avoidance response. Using choice tests between unoiled and oiled sediments at one of three randomized concentrations (low: 0.1 L oil m-2, medium: 0.5 L oil m-2, or high: 3.0 L oil m-2), we found that, even at low prior exposure levels, killifish lose recognition of oiled sediments compared to control, unexposed fish. Preference for unoiled sediments was absent across all oil concentrations after oil exposure, and some evidence for preference of oiled sediments at high exposure was demonstrated. These results highlight the lack of response to toxic environments in exposed individuals, indicating altered behavior despite organism survival.

These laminated systems, which bind, trap and precipitate mineral include: microbial mats at Laguna Tebenquiche and Laguna La Brava, gypsum domes at Tebenquiche and carbonate microbialites at La Brava. Microbial diversity and key biogeochemical characteristics of both lakes (La Brava and Tebenquiche) and their various microbial ecosystems (non-lithifying mats, flat and domal microbialites) were determined. The composition and abundance of minerals ranged from trapped and bound halite in organic-rich non-lithifying mats to aragonite-dominated lithified flat microbialites and gypsum in lithified domal structures. Pyrosequencing of the V4 region of the 16s rDNA gene showed that Proteobacteria comprised a major phylum in all of the microbial ecosystems studied, with a marked lower abundance in the non-lithifying mats. A higher proportion of Bacteroidetes was present in Tebenquiche sediments compared to La Brava samples. The concentration of pigments, particularly that of Chlorophyll a, was higher in the Tebenquiche than in La Brava. Pigments typically associated with anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria were present in lower amounts. Organic-rich, non-lithifying microbial mats frequently formed snake-like, bulbous structures due to gas accumulation underneath the mat. We hypothesize that the lithified microbialites might have developed from these snake-like microbial mats following mineral precipitation in the surface layer, producing domes with endoevaporitic communities in Tebenquiche and carbonate platforms in La Brava. Whereas the potential role of microbes in carbonate platforms is well established, the contribution of endoevaporitic microbes to formation of gypsum domes needs further investigation.",,,,,,,,,87,1,0,0,61,4,95,,,1431-0651,1433-4909,,,,,,,,,,"Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CCT, Planta Piloto Proc Ind Microbiol PROIMI, Lab Invest Microbiol Lagunas Andinas, San Miguel De Tucuman, ArgentinaCEA, Santiago 2741872, ChileUniv Nacl La Plata, CONICET, Ctr Invest Geol, La Plata, Buenos Aires, ArgentinaGeosci Univ Connecticut, Ctr Integrat, Storrs, CT 06269 USAUniv New S Wales, Australian Ctr Astrobiol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",CEAGeosci Univ Connecticut,,,2014-03-01,WOS:000331970700011,24442191,,,,

The upward infiltration of water enriched mainly by Cl- and K+ species appears to occur on the background of earlier diagenesis processes within the gas vent sediments. The GHs were formed from water with chlorinity ranging from 530 to 570 mM. The delta(18)O and deltaD of GH water varied from -1.4 to -1.8parts per thousand and from -13 to -18parts per thousand, respectively, representing a mix of seawater and infiltrating fluid water. A complex interaction of pore water, water of ascending fluid and segregated pore water during hydrate formation is also supported by water content measurements and observed gas hydrate structure.

Previous work on the marine effects of this activity is geographically incomplete, and has tended to focus on direct hydrocarbon impacts, while impacts from other related contaminants (e.g. heavy metals, salt-rich drilling muds) which may be discharged from oil facilities have not been widely assessed. Here, we examine historical trace element accumulation in marine sediments collected from four sites in the Tamaulipas shelf, Gulf of Mexico, in the area of the Arenque oil field. Dated sediment cores were used to examine the sources, and historical and contemporary inputs, of trace metals (including those typically present in oil industry discharges) and their potential biological impact in the Tamaulipas aquatic environment over the last 100 years. CaO (i.e. biogenic component) normalized data showed increasing V, Cr, Zn, Cu, Pb, Zr and Ba towards the sediment surface in three of the four cores, with Ba and V (based on an adverse effect index) possibly associated with adverse effects on organisms. Dated Ba/CaO profiles show an increase of 30-137% after opening of oil installations in the study area, and can be broadly correlated with increasing oil industry activities across the wider Gulf of Mexico. Data do not record however a clear enhancement of Ba concentration in sediment cores collected near to oil platforms over more distal cores, indicating that any Ba released from drilling platforms is incorporated quickly into the sediments around the drilling sites, and once this element has been deposited its rate of resuspension and mobility is low.Capsule abstract: Sediment core data from the Tamaulipas shelf show the influence of oil industry activities on selected trace element concentrations, with Ba/CaO broadly correlating with increasing oil industry activities across the wider Gulf of Mexico.

Stakeholder concern often focuses on the potential for local displacement caused by impact piling, where piles are hammered into the seabed. To mitigate this threat, use of vibration piling, where piles are shaken into place with a vibratory hammer, is often encouraged due to presumed impact reduction. However, data on comparative responses of cetaceans to these different noise sources are lacking. We studied the responses of bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises to both impact and vibration pile driving noise during harbor construction works in northeast Scotland, using passive acoustic monitoring devices to record cetacean activity and noise recorders to measure and predict received noise levels. Local abundance and patterns of occurrence of bottlenose dolphins were also compared with a five-year baseline. The median peak-to-peak source level estimated for impact piling was 240 dB re 1 lPa (single-pulse sound exposure level [SEL] 198 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 s), and the r.m.s. source level for vibration piling was 192 dB re 1 lPa. Predicted received broadband SEL values 812 m from the piling site were markedly lower due to high propagation loss: 133.4 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 s (impact) and 128.9 dB re 1 lPa2 s (vibration). Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises were not excluded from sites in the vicinity of impact piling or vibration piling; nevertheless, some small effects were detected. Bottlenose dolphins spent a reduced period of time in the vicinity of construction works during both impact and vibration piling. The probability of occurrence of both cetacean species was also slightly less during periods of vibration piling. This work provides developers and managers with the first evidence of the comparative effects of vibration and impact piling on small cetaceans, enabling more informed risk assessments, policy frameworks, and mitigation plans. In particular, our results emphasize the need for better understanding of noise levels and behavioral responses to vibration piling before recommending its use to mitigate impact piling.",,,,,,,,,15,1,0,0,12,0,16,,,2150-8925,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Lighthouse Field Stn, George St, Cromarty IV11 8YL, Ross Shire, ScotlandCefas, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, EnglandUniv St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland",,,,2017-06-16,WOS:000402472300034,,,,,

Using the InVEST model, this work quantifies and assesses the value of the carbon balance generated by predictive land-use change (LUC) scenarios for the Northern Coast of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. In this case, carbon losses are explained by the suppression of natural vegetation and human intervention associated to global warming. We analyzed three scenarios: i) the more conservative legal framework; ii) the status quo, which represents the current development level; and iii) the new ventures, encompassing all new infrastructure projects in the region. The carbon losses in the legal framework and status quo scenarios are similar to those of past periods: around 3.7 million MgC in twenty years, pointing to net current values of US$ 47 million. However, carbon losses exceeded 7 million MgC when considering factors linked to the new ventures scenario, such as infrastructure logistics, oil-gas exploration and pressure on natural environments. In this case, monetary losses could amount to US$ 90 million in 20 years.

We conclude that intermittent surface connectivity and especially permanent isolation of floodplain pools from the main river channel may severely alter BCC and EEA, with potential consequences for nutrient cycling, ecological services and greenhouse gas emissions. Disentangling microbial structure-function coupling is therefore crucial, if we are to understand and predict the consequences of human alterations on these dynamic systems.",,,,,,,,,13,1,0,0,11,0,17,,,1015-1621,1420-9055,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Vienna, Dept Limnol & Oceanog, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, AustriaWasserCluster Lunz, Dr Carl Kupelwieser Promenade 5, A-3293 Lunz Am See, AustriaLinkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Campus Valla, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",WasserCluster Lunz,,,2020-02-18,WOS:000518627900003,32165802,,,,

The behaviour in operational and storm conditions without faults is provided as a base of comparison. They are followed by the responses to 50 year extreme values defined by the IEC standards, North Sea statistics, and Portugal's coastal storm data. All environmental conditions are head waves upwind sets, presumably causing minimal yaw excitation despite differing in wave excitation frequencies and maximum wind speeds. These scenarios are expanded further to cases where one of the pitch actuators stops functioning and fails to feather the blade. The result reveals large angle yaw motions of the platform. The reasoning behind this motion is explained and a possible method of mitigation through a revision of the HSS brake capacity is discussed.

To understand its success on such artificial substrata we examined various aspects of its life history and population dynamics. A. biserialis is a gonochoric brooder. The percentage of colonies on the artificial substrata bearing gonads ranged from none (September 1994 and 1995) to 100% (January 1994, 1995 and April 1994). Mature oocytes and sperm sacs reached rather small maximum diameters of 240 and 160 mu m, respectively, probably dictated by the small gastrovascular cavities. A continuous release of planulae was observed in the laboratory from March to July 1995. Planulation occurred during various lunar phases, and both by day and night. Recruitment of A. biserialis on PVC plates attached to the jetties coincided with the breeding period inferred from the laboratory findings. Recruits reached a maximum height of 3 cm within 3 months, thus exhibiting a remarkably rapid growth rate compared with other gorgonians. This high colony growth rate may compensate for the lack of clonal propagation in the studied A. biserialis population. The complex substrata of the jetties provide the conditions required for successful colonization, which include upside-down orientation, an adequate light regime and exposure to flow.

Marine renewable energy devices (MREDs) interact with their receiving environment and are de-facto artificial reefs. The Loch Linnhe Artificial Reef (LLR) complex is a large-scale experimental facility, with the main matrix consisting of 30 separate reef modules deployed in 10-30 m depth and over a gradient of hydrographic and sedimentological conditions. The LLR offers potential to examine impacts that are analogous to those likely to occur around MREDs. The extent of the impact of the LLR modules on the receiving environment was assessed by determining their effect on sedimentary redox potential, as a function of distance from the reef-edge, and season, using an innovative, hand-held, underwater redox probe. The results are commensurate with the reef-proximal baffling of water flow resulting in the entrapment of drifting phytodetritus. At the least current-exposed reef-group the expected decrease in mean redox, at 80 mm sediment depth, was 80 mV (95% Cl 40, 120 mV) but this effect was not observed more than 1 m from the reef edge and only occurred during summer months (water temperature >10 degrees C). Redox at the reef edge, particularly during summer months, was more variable compared to redox taken at 1 m and 4 m reef-distance and was associated with the patchy distribution of phytodetrital accumulations. At all reef groups, there was no discernible difference in modelled mean redox between observations taken at 1 m and 4 m-reef distance. Artificial structures, including MREDs, may cause quite major sedimentary changes but this evidence suggests that these effects will be of limited spatial scale and, where phytodetrital accumulations occur, are only likely to be detrimental in oxygen-deficient sediments. Where these changes occur at well-flushed sites they are likely to be associated with increased infaunal biomass typical of moderate organic enrichment. (C) 2014 The Author.

A review of ERAs in in the context of spatial management revealed a synonymous use of the concepts of risk, vulnerability and impact, a need to account for uncertainty and a lack of a clear link between risk analysis and risk evaluation. In a case study, we addressed some of the identified gaps and predicted the risk of changing the current state of benthic disturbance by bottom trawling due to future MSP measures in the German EEZ of the North Sea. We used a quantitative, dynamic, and spatially explicit approach where we combined a Bayesian belief network with GIS to showcase the steps of risk characterization, risk analysis, and risk evaluation. We distinguished 10 benthic communities and 6 international fishing fleets. The risk analysis produced spatially explicit estimates of benthic disturbance, which was computed as a ratio between relative local mortality by benthic trawling and the recovery potential after a trawl event. Results showed great differences in spatial patterns of benthic disturbance when accounting for different environmental impacts of the respective fleets. To illustrate a risk evaluation process, we simulated a spatial shift of the international effort of two beam trawl fleets, which are affected the most by future offshore wind development. The Bayesian belief network (BN) model was able to predict the proportion of the area where benthic disturbance likely increases.

J,,,,,,,,,Michael Brown,,Screw piles for wind energy foundation systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Feb 26 2016,2016,"Screw (or helical) piles are foundations which are screwed into the ground. They are widely used onshore for supporting motorway signs and gantries as they possess good tensile and compressive resistance. This project aims to make screw piles a more attractive foundation (or anchoring) option offshore for wind farms, which are being deployed in deeper water and subject to increasing performance demands. The UK has challenging targets for expansion of energy from renewables with the potential for over 5000 offshore wind turbines by 2020. The necessary move to deeper water will increase cost and put greater demands on subsea structures and foundations. The current foundation solutions being considered for these applications are driven piles, large monopiles or concrete gravity based structures (GBS). Driving of piles in large numbers offshore causes concerns over plant availability and impact on marine mammals. There are also concerns over the limit of practical monopile development and the high material demands of GBS. Screw piles have the potential to overcome these issues and are scalable for future development from current onshore systems which have relatively low noise installation and are efficient in terms of both tensile and compressive capacity. To meet offshore demands, screw piles will require geometry enhancement but it is envisaged that these will initially be modest to allow de-risked transfer of onshore technology offshore. This will lead to the deployment of several smaller piles or pile groups rather than moving straight to very large single screw piles that may prove difficult to install and require significant investment. To allow screw piles to be considered as a foundation solution for offshore wind this project will develop piles with optimised geometries that minimise resistance to installation but are capable of carrying high lateral and moment loads. In order to install screw piles torque devices are used to effectively screw the anchors into the ground. With increased pile size requirements and potential changes in geometry this project will develop improved, less empirical techniques to predict the torque required in a variety of soil conditions. This will allow confidence in pile installation and investment in appropriately sized installation plant. As new pile geometries are being developed these will need to be tested (through model, numerical and field testing in this project) to verify that they can meet the performance demands of the offshore environment. The project will also develop bespoke analysis techniques to allow consulting geotechnical engineers the tools they require to design the foundations and contractors the tools to inform the installation processes. As piles can be deployed as large single units or smaller units in groups the efficiency of group deployment and multiple foundation geometries will be explored, as using several smaller geometry foundations could reduce the risks during offshore installation and actually be more economic due to lower fabrication costs and demands on installation plant. The areas of investigation above will be combined to produce a design and decision making toolkit for use by geotechnical designers to allow deployment of screw piles as offshore foundations in an efficient and cost effective manner.The research has the potential to make it easier to deploy screw pile foundations for offshore renewables. This project will develop foundations able to deal with current water depths and will provide understanding of the behaviour of piles as water depths and the demands on the foundations increase. By harnessing the installation and performance benefits of screw pile/anchor technology, the results of the project will contribute to an overall cost reduction in electricity generated by renewable means and increase the public's confidence in the future viability of this energy source.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/N006054/1,,,,,,,,University of Dundee,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15340039,,,,,

J,,,,,,,,,Keith Worden,,"Structural Health Monitoring of Systems of Systems: Populations, Networks and Communities",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 30 2018,2018,"One of the main contributors towards the cost of high-value engineering assets is the cost of maintenance. Taking an aircraft out of service for inspection means loss of revenue. However, if damage occurs and leads to catastrophic failure, safety and casualties are major issues. In terms of an offshore wind farm, the cost of an unscheduled visit to a remote ocean site to replace a 75m blade is exceedingly high. If one adopts an approach to maintenance where the structure of interest is monitored constantly by permanent sensors, and data processing algorithms alert the owner or user when damage is developing, one can optimise the maintenance programme for cost without sacrificing safety. If damage is detected early, repair rather than replacement can be viable.The complexity of modern structures and their challenging operating environments make it difficult to develop algorithms that can detect and identify early damage. The relevant discipline - structural health monitoring (SHM) - suffers from problems that have prevented uptake of the technology by industry. Although structural complexity makes analysis difficult, one variant of SHM - the data-based approach - shows great promise. In this case one uses machine learning techniques to diagnose damage from measured data. Data-based SHM faces a number of challenges; the first is that most data-based approaches to SHM require measured data from the structure in all possible states of damage. For a structure like an 5 MW wind turbine - it is simply not conceivable that one should damage a single one for data collection purposes, let alone many. Fortunately, if one is only interested in whether damage is present or not, this is possible using only data from the healthy condition. One builds a picture of the healthy state of the structure and then monitors for deviations. This raises a second issue with data-based SHM; if one is monitoring the structure for changes, one does not wish to be deceived by a benign change in its environmental/operational conditions - so-called 'confounding influences'.The original Fellowship aimed to solve these problems via a population-based approach to SHM modelled on the discipline of 'syndromic surveillance' (SS), which is used to detect disease outbreaks in human populations. The core of the proposed research was an intelligent database holding data across populations of structures, and an inference engine that could use damage data from an individual, to allow diagnostics on others. The original work has progressed very well; the required database was created and algorithms for inference across populations have been developed and demonstrated. Algorithms for removing confounding influences have also been created which are arguably now the state of the art. The Fellowship so far has also allowed insights into how population-based SHM can go far beyond technologies based on SS, leading to this new proposal. Very new concepts in SHM will be explored. The first idea is to extend the 'database' to an 'ontology'; ontologies encode, share and re-use domain knowledge. In a way, moving to an ontology adds a 'language centre' to the existing storage and processing; one might even think of the result as a computational brain concentrating on a specific engineering field - in this case SHM. New population-based methods are proposed. For populations of near-identical structures, the idea of the 'form' of a structure is presented. The form is created to represent all individuals in a population, if damage data are available for an individual turbine in a wind farm, they can be transferred into the form and thus allow inference across the farm. Furthermore, a general theory of populations of disparate structures will be constructed using ideas from mathematics and computation: geometry, graph theory, complex networks and machine learning. Again, the theory will allow damage data from individuals to generate insights across the population.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/R003645/1,,,,,,,,University of Sheffield,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15322481,,,,,
J,,,,,,,,,Lars Johanning,,Resilient Integrated-Coupled FOW platform design methodology (ResIn),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jul 02 2017,2017,"This project will enhance the design and development of floating offshore renewables, in particular offshore floating wind as commercially viable electricity infrastructure through a risk based approach allowing to build resilience against extreme events. The socio-economic challenge is the increasing energy need in emerging economies, such as China, which causes grave air pollution and CO2 emissions. The project work focusses on China, where heavy air pollution alone is estimated to have caused 2.2million premature deaths. Sustainable energy generation, thus replacing coal-fired power plants is one of the solutions to address this problem. In China specifically, the energy demand is at its highest along the industrialised and densely populated coastal regions. The challenge for a renewable energy supply is that the solar, wind and hydro resource are primarily located in the NW and SW of China and electricity transmission via the grid is already constrained. The Chinese government therefore has identified offshore wind energy as one of the primary energy resources with a potential of over 500GW of installed capacity, capable to produce up to 1,500 TWh of electricity per year, which would offset as many as 340 coal-fired power stations. Whilst initial installations in shallow waters near the coast have been made, over 1/3rd of the resource is located in deeper water (>40m) and will require floating installations. Offshore wind energy generation is currently more expensive than fossil fuels in China, and the risk of typhoon damage is high. The project has a fourfold approach: 1.Enhanced environmental modelling to accurately determine extreme loadings; 2. Assessment of novel, porous floating offshore wind structures and active damping mechanisms; 3. Enhanced numerical modelling techniques to efficiently calculate the complex coupled behaviour of floating wind turbines; 4. Risk based optimisation of devised designs and engineering implications. This combined approach is carried through distinguished scientific research expertise and leading industry partners in the field of offshore wind. To maximise the impact and benefits of this research the project places large emphasis on knowledge exchange activities, industry liaison and the establishment of cross-country research capacity to foster the global commercial realisation of offshore floating wind energy. The project is an interdisciplinary, cross-country collaboration with leading research Universities and industry partners. The academic expertise from the University of Exeter, the University of Edinburgh and University of Bath in the areas of Environmental assessment and modelling, Hydrodynamic design, Advanced computational modelling and risk based reliability engineering is matched with Dalian University of Technology and Zhejiang University as two of the leading Chinese research institutions in Ocean Engineering and Offshore Renewable Energy. Whilst the project carries out fundamental engineering research, strong industrial partnerships in both countries will facilitate industry advice and subsequent research uptake. The strong industrial UK support for this project through the ORE Catapult, DNV-GL, ITPE is matched with wider international support through EDF (France) and DSA (Canada), as well as the Chinese project partners MingYang Wind Power Ltd (3rd largest wind manufacturer in China), the National Ocean Technology Centre, NOTC, (institutional responsibility for marine spatial planning) and the 'Shanghai Investigation, Design & Research Institute', SIDRI (State-owned offshore wind project developer in China), demonstrates the timeliness and industrial relevance of the proposed research. All partners are committed to support the establishment of a long-lasting research base to develop resilient and cost effective offshore floating wind energy systems through collaborative research and innovation efforts, as well as capacity building and knowledge exchange.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/R007519/1,,,,,,,,University of Exeter,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15394327,,,,,

In this study, a three-dimensional integrated numerical model is developed to investigate the wave-induced seabed response around a monopile foundation. In the model, the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are used for the mean fluid flow, while the Biots consolidation equations are used for the solid-pore fluid interaction in a porous seabed. The monopile is considered as a single phase medium and behaves under a linear elastic law. To reproduce the residual soil behavior under cyclic shearing induced by ocean waves as well as structural rocking motions, a poro-elastoplastic model is adopted, in which the consolidation analysis of seabed foundation under gravitational forces including the body force of structure is pre-assessed and incorporated. The present numerical framework was first validated against several laboratory experiments and obtaining fairly good agreements. Based on the proposed model, failure of monopile foundation caused by liquefaction due to the buildup of pore water pressure under cyclic shearing is investigated. Numerical results indicate that the potential areas for residual pore pressure development and the resulting liquefaction are most pronounced in the vicinity of the monopile following the wave propagation direction, which is caused by waves as well as the rocking motion of the structure induced by the wave impact. Parametric studies indicate that there is no possibility of generating soil liquefaction below the pile bottom in the vicinity of the mono-pile even under large waves.",,,,,,,,,65,5,0,0,0,0,68,,,0378-3839,1872-7379,,,,,,,,,,"Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaHohai Univ, Coll Harbor Coastal & Offshore Engn, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaGriffith Univ, Griffith Sch Engn, Gold Coast Campus, Qld 4222, AustraliaShanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaNingbo Univ, Fac Architectural Civil Engn & Environm, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000412617400001,,,,,

We made use of the Norwegian Oil Industrial Association database and extracted concurrently obtained data on species density and contaminant levels in sediment samples collected between 1996 and 2001. In brief, effect concentrations (ECs) of each installation (i.e., oil platform) at a given reduction in species density were firstly derived by fitting a logistic-type regression function to the relationship between the species density and the corresponding concentration of a chemical of concern. The estimated ECs were further improved by the NEBM which incorporated information from other installations. The distribution of these improved ECs from all installations was determined nonparametrically by the kernel method, and then used to determine the hazardous concentration (HC) which can be directly linked to the species loss (or the species being protected) in the sediment. This method also enables an accurate estimation of the lower confidence limit of the HC, even when the number of observations was small. To illustrate the effectiveness of this novel technique, barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, lead, tetrahydrocannabinol, and zinc were chosen as example contaminants.

The rate of body mass loss during fasting is probably related to internal parameters such as initial body mass and blubber thickness, hormonal and reproductive state, and anxiety and activity levels, as well as to environmental parameters such as water and air temperature. Reduced blubber thickness causes reduced insulation which, in turn, increases heat loss to the environment. If blubber cannot be replenished by eating extra food, porpoises' fitness may decline, which may eventually result in hypothermia and pneumonia To increase understanding of the effects of fasting, the body condition of two captive porpoises was quantified while they were kept under ambient temperature conditions similar to those experienced by wild conspecifics in the North Sea, and while they were near-fasting (i.e., almost fasting) for 24 hours (consuming 3 to 10% of the average daily food intake of their normal ration in each period). Replicated near-fasting periods took place during each of the four seasons of the year, and body mass (an indicator of body condition) declined in all 30 near-fasting periods (15 for each animal). For both porpoises in all seasons, body mass loss represented approximately 4% of initial body mass (of which -0.7% was due to loss of food in the alimentary canal). Blubber thickness was difficult to quantify due to low measurement accuracy in relation to loss, but small decreases in blubber thickness (0 to 3 mm) occurred. A linear mixed-effects model showed that mass loss was greatest overall in autumn, lowest in summer, and intermediate in winter and spring. Harbor porpoises, therefore, appear to be most vulnerable to the effects of fasting due to disturbance in autumn, perhaps because their blubber layer has to increase in autumn to cope with the decreasing water temperature.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,15,0,19,,,0167-5427,,,,,,,,,,,"Sea Mammal Res Co SEAMARCO, Julianalaan 46, NL-3843 CC Harderwijk, NetherlandsDotmoth, 1 Mendip Villas,Crabtree Lane, Bristol BS41 8LN, Avon, England",Sea Mammal Res Co SEAMARCODotmoth,,,2019-01-25,WOS:000455564300005,,,,,

However, complex interactions within the shelf seas hinder the identification and unambiguous attribution of observed changes to drivers. These include variability in the climate system, in ocean dynamics, in biogeochemistry, and in shelf sea resource exploitation in the widest sense by societies. Observational time series are commonly too short, and resolution, integration time, and complexity of models are often insufficient to unravel natural variability from anthropogenic perturbation. The North Sea is a shelf sea of the North Atlantic and is impacted by virtually all global and regional developments. Natural variability (from interannual to multidecadal time scales) as response to forcing in the North Atlantic is overlain by global trends (sea level, temperature, acidification) and alternating phases of direct human impacts and attempts to remedy those. Human intervention started some 1000 years ago (diking and associated loss of wetlands), expanded to near-coastal parts in the industrial revolution of the mid-19th century (river management, waste disposal in rivers), and greatly accelerated in the mid-1950s (eutrophication, pollution, fisheries). The North Sea is now a heavily regulated shelf sea, yet societal goals (good environmental status versus increased uses), demands for benefits and policies diverge increasingly. Likely, the southern North Sea will be re-zoned as riparian countries dedicate increasing sea space for offshore wind energy generation with uncertain consequences for the system's environmental status. We review available observational and model data (predominantly from the southeastern North Sea region) to identify and describe effects of natural variability, of secular changes, and of human impacts on the North Sea ecosystem, and outline developments in the next decades in response to environmental legislation, and in response to increased use of shelf sea space.

This study investigates for the first time the effects of flow depth on the wake behavior downstream of a horizontal axis hydrokinetic turbine. The far wake velocity deficit did not exhibit the symmetric Gaussian profile often found downstream of wind turbines. The flow confinement in an open channel causes the wake to recover more slowly compared to wind tunnel studies with deeper boundary layers. Our results show that with the same local mean kinetic energy, from which the turbine is able to extract energy, a greater total mean kinetic energy in the flow affects the rate of wake recovery. It is observed that for a deeper flow, the mean velocity recovers more rapidly and the turbulence intensity recovers more slowly. In addition to turbulence intensity and thrust coefficient, the ratio of the flow depth to the turbine diameter (H/D) is shown to be an important parameter related to the wake recovery rate. This parameter represents the amount of total incoming mean kinetic energy available for the turbine wake recovery and is much lower for hydrokinetic turbines compared to wind turbines.

The systematic description of the stromatoporoids includes 20 genera with 32 species. Although the Occurrence of many species is reported for the first time from the Eifel Area and some species are also new for Europe, in general the occurrence is consistent with the pandemic distribution pattern of. many Givetian and Frasnian stromatoporoids. Whereas coral dominated reef communities occur only in the marine-subtidal facies zone, stromatoporoid habitats comprise lagoonal settings as well as fully marine settings. However, environmental conditions exceed tolerance of single stromatoporoid species. Therefore taxonomic composition of stromatoporidoccurrences reflect the conditions in which they thrived. The use of a semi-quantitative approach makes it possible to define characteristic stromatoporoid assemblages. The Salairella buecheliensis - Stromatopora huepschii assemblage is the most species-rich id assemblage established under stable marine stromatoporoid assemblage established under stable marine conditions in a low stress environment. The stromatoporoid assemblage characterized by Hermatostroma schlueteri shows reduced diversity and occurs in lagoonal, slightly restricted settings. Indicative for PrOlIOLIFICCCI environmental instabil' in even more restricted settings is the low diversity Actinostroma assemblage. Habrostroma laminosum, Gerronostromina cf. kitatense and some Clathrocoilona species typically occur in coral-dominated patch reefs. Occurrence of these species signifies possible mesotrophic conditions, enhanced by nutrient and organic matter influx from land and from estuarine upwelling during transgressions.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,0,5,,,1612-4138,,,,,,,,,,,"Lenzhalde 70, D-70192 Stuttgart, Germany",,,,2008-01-01,BCI:BCI200800586870,,,,,

The complex interaction between the local deformation in the dented region and global bending of the tubular member may severely reduce the plastic collapse load which strongly affects its load-deflection behavior.

This manuscript focuses on investigating if tidal forces are playing a key role to keep the area's unique coral reefs alive and well. Determining the reasons why coral species and community of organisms found here survive despite all stressors is critical, and such information may hold the key to the preservation of reefs elsewhere. Phase and amplitude for 35 tidal constituents were deducted from observations of water surface elevation at the study site (first of its kind). The main tidal constituents based on their amplitudes are: M2, N2, S2, K1, NU2, K2, 2Ns, L2, and MU2. The first five tidal constituents of the aforementioned list are enough to reproduce accurate predictions of tides at this location (R2 variance = 87.54% and RMS = 0.167). The Tidal Form number (0.07) at Zaki's Reef indicates a fully semidiurnal dominated tidal regime. Moreover, the Sa and Ssa constituents obtained from nearby stations made no improvements on tidal prediction results. Spectral analysis results of the white noise (residuals) from observed water surface elevation are dominated by daily frequency, suggesting that local wind plays a key role in circulation at study site. Local wind generated southerly long-shore and year-round offshore wind stress with a mean of -0.36&0.35 Nm2, respectively. The persistent longshore and offshore currents help transport oil patches/spills, from the two nearby ports, away from the reef. Yet, offshore wind stress, pushing water away from the shore, may cause more exposure of the reef to extreme atmospheric conditions. We hypothesize that the repeated reef exposure to the combined effect of tides and offshore wind stress over many years may have played a key role in selecting and then enhancing corals ability, through training, to become more adaptable to those harsh conditions. Training of corals over the years, may have led to the dominance of only six species, out of 35 coral species known to exist in the gulf. Those heat-adopted dominant species can be used to stimulate and revive impacted coral sites elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,2162-1985; 2162-1993,,,,,,,,,,,"H2O & Geo LLC, West Palm Beach, FL, 33409, USA",,,,2020-08-03,ZOOREC:ZOOR15608057137,,,,,

Trawling is a method of catching fish in a large volume where fish nets are pulled through water using one or two boats. Bottom trawling is where the nets are pulled over on the seabed. The gear of the bottom trawling would impact the exposed subsea pipeline, on the seabed. Subsea pipelines transport crude oil and gas from the offshore platform to shore facility. This study assesses the risk of fish trawling activities to the subsea pipelines at Sabah and Labuan offshore. The specification of trawl equipment used by local trawlers in Sabah was determined by the on-site survey. The frequency of a fish trawler crossing over the pipelines was calculated based interview on operation and site survey. The calculation of the pull-over load of the otter board was calculated using the DNVGL algorithm. The severity and frequency index of the risk matrix was developed based on literature review.

Natural events, such as the sinking of surface plant and animal material to the seabed, sediment slides, benthic storms and hydrothermal vents can contribute vast amounts of material, both organic and inorganic, to the deep ocean. In the past the deep sea has been used as a repository for sewage, dredge spoil and radioactive waste. In addition, there has been interest in the disposal of large man-made objects and, more recently, the disposal of industrially-produced carbon dioxide. Some of the materials disposed of in the deep sea may have natural analogues. This review examines natural processes in the deep sea including the vertical flux of organic material, turbidity currents and benthic storms, natural gas emissions, hydrothermal vents, natural radionuclides and rocky substrata, and compares them with anthropogenic input including sewage disposal, dredge spoil, carbon dioxide disposal, chemical contamination and the disposal of radioactive waste, wrecks and rigs. The comparison shows what are true analogues and what are false friends.

Both model simulations and field measurements showed reversal of offshore flows at the back beach and creation of an onshore sediment transport potential. The influence of flow reversals on the beach-dune transport system and foredune growth patterns has previously received little attention. Detailed wind flow measurements were made using an extensive array of mast-mounted, 3-D ultrasonic anemometers (50 Hz), arranged parallel to the dominant incident wind direction. Large eddy simulation (LES) of the offshore wind flow over the dune was conducted using the open-source CFD tool openFOAM. The computational domain included a terrain model obtained by airborne LiDAR and detailed ground DGPS measurements. The computational grid (similar to 22 million cells) included localized mesh refinement near the complex foredune terrain to capture finer details of the dune morphology that might affect wind flows on the adjacent beach. Measured and simulated wind flow are presented and discussed. The CFD simulations offer new insights into the flow mechanics associated with offshore winds and how the terrain steering of wind flow impacts on the geomorphological behaviour of the dune system. Simulation of 3-D wind flows over complex terrain such as dune systems, presents a valuable new tool for geomorphological research, as it enables new insights into the relationship between the wind field and the underlying topography. The results show that offshore and obliquely offshore winds result in flow reversal and onshore directed winds at distances of up to 20 m from the embryo dune toe. The potential geomorphological significance of the findings are discussed and simple calculations show that incoming offshore and obliquely offshore winds with mean velocities over 13 m s(-1) and 7 m s(-1), respectively, have the potential to create onshore-directed winds at the back beach with mean velocities above 3.3m s(-1). These are above the threshold of movement for dry sand and support previous conclusions about the significance of offshore winds in dune and beach budget calculations.

GIS-based multi-criteria approach was applied, combining data from empirical maps, numerical models and remote sensing to estimate suitability parameters. Site selection and prioritisation of suitable areas considered 15 environmental and socio-economic criteria, which contributed to 4 optimisation models (settlement, growth and survival of mussels, environmental and socio-economic) and 3 predefined scenarios representing provisional goals of mussel cultivation: spat production, biomass production and bioremediation. The relative importance of each criterion was assessed utilizing the Analytical Hierarchy Process. Site suitability index was calculated and the final result of the site selection analysis was summarized for 3 scenarios and overall suitability map. Four suitability classes (unsuitable, least, moderately and most suitable) were applied, and 3 most suitable zones for provisional zebra mussel cultivation with 12 candidate sites were selected accordingly. The integrated approach presented in this study can be adjusted for designating zebra mussel farming sites in other estuarine lagoon ecosystems, or cultivation of other mussel species for bioremediation purposes. The analytical framework and the workflow designed in this study are also adoptable for addressing other aquaculture-related spatial planning issues. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Estimates of surface momentum, sensible heat, and latent heat fluxes have been made from the surface observations using the COARE software. Simulations by the National Weather Service's Eta meteorological model are compared with the observations of surface fluxes and wind profiles. The boundary layer is found to be unstable over 90% of the time, and latent heat fluxes are about five to ten times larger than sensible heat fluxes, as usually found over tropical oceans. Eta model simulations of surface fluxes are within about +/- 50% of COARE estimates of the fluxes based on surface observations. Most of the time, COARE-derived fluxes at 11 sites are within a factor of two of each other at any given hour. In multi-day case studies, COARE calculations are found to agree with Eta model simulations of these fluxes and parameters within a factor of two most of the time.

For the first nine, long-term passive acoustic monitoring has been conducted in the German Baltic Sea from the Kiel Bight to the Pomeraman Bay From August 2002 to December 2005. Porpoise detectors (T-PODs) have been installed five to seven metres below the water surface at up to 42 measuring positions throughout the investigated area, registering the exact times of echolocation signals of passing harbour porpoises. The proportion of monitored days with porpoise detection in each quarter of the years has been analysed. A correlation of the results with the longitude of the measuring position revealed a significant decrease from west to cast in the percentage of days with porpoise detections. Comparison of data gathered in the first quarters with the third quarters of the monitoring years displayed a seasonal variation with fewer days of porpoise detections in winter time than in summer time. Nevertheless, harbour porpoises have been detected year-round at most of the measuring positions in the German Baltic Sea.

A stand-alone energy system including storage facilities is simulated, optimized and analyzed relying on real-case weather and demand data of a relatively large remote community. Optimization of the power plant structure shows that to ensure continuous off-grid energy generation, even under extreme conditions, the combination of more than one renewable technology is required. The hybrid power plant consists of a pumped-storage hydropower plant, photovoltaic cells and wind turbines. Energy surplus of the power plant is used in the incorporated electrolyzer to generate a secondary product, hydrogen. Robust operation of the plant results in 48% of the energy generated stemming from the photovoltaic system and 52% from the wind turbines. The pumped-storage hydropower plant has a mean annual power output of 1.0 MW. The total mean annual efficiency of the hybrid plant is found to be 14.4%. Although stand-alone operation was achieved with the proposed plant, this requirement led to net energy output restrictions, capacity oversizing and large storage facilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Coastal countries need to know the wave energy potential along their coasts, so its contribution to the future electricity market is estimated. Spain has noticeable variations in its average wave climate, so it is essential to analyse numerous locations. For research purposes, wave energy potential is estimated based on data from the 15 Spanish State Port buoys currently in operation in deep waters. Because these buoys were set up at different times, with some moored around 2005, the sample between 2005 and 2015 is studied with the purpose of comparing results. REDEXT buoys, arranged from highest to lowest wave energy potential, are: Villano-Sisargas (56.84 kW/m), Cabo Silleiro (53.50 kW/m), Estaca de Bares (53.36 kW/m), Cabo de Penas (39.66 kW/m), Bilbao-Vizcaya (39.09 kW/m), Gran Canaria (23.71 kW/m), Mahon (16.21 kW/m), Cabo de Begur (13.95 kW/m), Golfo de Cadiz (12.70 kW/m), Dragonera (10.16 kW/m), Cabo de Gata (8.43 kW/m), Cabo de Palos (8.17 kW/m), Tenerife Sur (6.93 kW/m), Tarragona (6.14 kW/m) and Valencia (5.42 kW/m). Some buoys were moored in the 1990s allowing an analysis to be made of how the average wave climate has changed over the last years. Furthermore, a study is undertaken analysing the feasibility of different wave energy converters, specifically Pelamis 750 kW, Oyster 300 kW, Aquabuoy 250 kW, and SSG 20,000 kW, in the 15 buoy locations. Energy production and the capacity factor of all devices for the 15 locations are calculated, obtaining as a result that the most suitable device for all the locations studied is Oyster, and the least suitable is SSG.

More stringent regulations, including reduced catch quotas and restrictions on the shrimp fishery to reduce bycatch of juvenile snappers, are anticipated. However, with projected rebuilding, maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is estimated to be between 11 and 25 million pounds. This exceeds previously recorded annual yields from U. S. Gulf waters. The fishery began during the mid 19th century off the northeastern Gulf coast, with harvests of only about 2 million pounds. Even at this rate, the stocks were depleted rapidly, and the fleets moved further south and east to find new sources. Numerous exploratory cruises to the western Gulf in the late 19th century found minimal snapper populations, but high concentrations discovered off Vera Cruz, Mexico, attracted fishers, and this area was the major source of snappers for more than a century. The deployment of petroleum structures in the mid 20th century in the western Gulf and thousands of artificial reefs in the north-central Gulf have markedly increased red snapper habitat in those areas. Currently, snapper populations around artificial reefs in the north-central and northwestern Gulf support the majority of the U. S. harvest. If habitat is limiting, the designations of overfishing and overfished may be misleading, and unrealized harvest potential may be a more accurate descriptor of the current status of the stock given the increased presence of additional habitat for red snapper. Decreases in these artificial structures (owing to natural degradation or removal) may decrease future harvest potential.",,,,,,,,,61,0,0,0,55,0,91,,,1064-1262,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USAMinnesota Sea Grant Coll Program, Duluth, MN USA",Minnesota Sea Grant Coll Program,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000263995500001,,,,,

Our research is guided by the radical approach to MSP which, at its centre, places the interplay between MSP actors and their stakes. Our approach certainly considers the relationship of MSP with politics and power, questioning the rational choice. Hence, we have selected fishers as a group which is often recognised as less privileged, with no or little influence on MSP. Firstly, using semi-structured interviews, we investigated the ways in which fishers identify the challenges inhibiting their meaningful participation in MSP. The fishers pointed out data and knowledge gaps as well as a perceived limited agency in decision-making. However, misconceptions about MSP, i.e., equating MSP to offshore wind farms, appeared to be the most significant short-term challenge. Secondly, through a focus group with MSP planners, we explored what the planners recognised as barriers to the fishers' active participation, and gauged the planners' awareness regarding the problems identified by the fishers. Both groups, fishers and planners, identified similar challenges. The major difference between these two groups was the issue of who should be responsible for addressing the concerns they identified. We conclude that much of the fishers' reluctance towards MSP stemmed from their negative experiences in previous marine management initiatives, leading to a general lack of trust among the members of this group. We speculate that this lack of trust could have been diminished through a properly implemented stakeholder mapping in the pre-planning phase. However, the schedule stipulated by the EU MSP Directive, i.e., to prepare the plans before early 2021, did not allow the necessary time for the accomplishment of this step. We, thus, postulate that the stakeholder consultation process should be decoupled from formal MSP, and it should be most active in the pre-planning phase.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,0,11,,,0964-5691,1873-524X,,,,,,,,,,"Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Warsaw, PolandMaritime Inst Gdansk, Gdansk, PolandNatl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Gdynia, PolandUniv Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland",,,,2019-10-25,WOS:000488137600017,,,,,

There is now also an association of Mediterranean artificial reef scientists. Research in Europe has reached a stage where scientific priorities for the future need to be developed in the light of previous research and experience.

The work is advancing a fundamental understanding of soil-structure interactions to develop a novel and sustainable foundation concept for offshore wind turbines: a Flying Wing Anchor. This anchor is a steel plate in the shape of an aerodynamically efficient winged aircraft. The anchor is installed silently and efficiently using gravity from free fall through the water column and penetration into the sea floor. Tension in the line that attaches the wind turbine structure to the anchor causes the anchor to dive and pitch toward the horizontal in service, maximizing the available holding capacity in bearing over the full wing surface in an extreme load. The intellectual challenges are (1) modeling the resistance of soil against a foundation in shear and bearing over the orders-of-magnitude range of strain rates corresponding to free-fall penetration, line pre-tensioning and ultimately storm loading and (2) capturing the dynamic, fully six-degree-of-freedom movement of a foundation as it flies through the soil during installation and service. The research plan comprises a comprehensive approach to physically testing scale models of a Flying Wing Anchor during penetration and in-service loading and numerically modeling the three-dimensional behavior with time of a Flying Wing Anchor with the Finite Element Method (FEM) and advanced constitutive models. It capitalizes on a U.S.-Ireland Research and Development Partnership Program to bring together a multidisciplinary, multiple-institution team that represents the European state-of-the art in offshore wind development and the U.S. state-of-the-art in offshore foundations. The project partners include The University of Texas at Austin, the University of Rhode Island, University College Dublin and Queen's University Belfast. With external funding from Invest NI and Science Foundation Ireland, the U.S. investment in this project is leveraged at a ratio of nearly 3 total dollars for each dollar invested from NSF. This research has the potential to improve foundation systems over a wide range of offshore and onshore applications by developing a green foundation concept, where nature initially installs it through gravity and then completes the installation through in-service loading. This research aims to reduce the economic and environmental cost of harnessing offshore wind energy, which is a key challenge to increasing the availability of renewable energy. This research will benefit society at large by providing cross-country and cross-Atlantic education and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, by fostering excitement in engineering and science for school children through exposing them to the development of a novel concept and giving them an opportunity to examine it themselves through a model testing facility, and by increasing public awareness of the promises and challenges of renewable energy through public demonstrations and workshops.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1301211,,,,,,,,University of Texas at Austin,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13754083,,,,,

Such infrastructure operates in a harsh environment. Allowance must be made for structural deterioration since protective measures such as paint coatings, galvanizing or cathodic protection may be ineffective. Reliability analysis requires accurate engineering models for the description and prediction of material corrosion loss and for the maximum depth of pitting. New probability-based models for both these forms of corrosion have been proposed recently and calibrated against a wide range of data. The effects of water velocity and of water pollution are reviewed and compared with recently reported field data for a corrosion at an offshore oil platform. The data interpreted according to the model show good correlation when allowance is made for the season of first immersion and the adverse effects of seawater velocity and of water pollution. An example is given to illustrate the application of reliability analysis to a pipeline subject to pitting corrosion. An important outcome is that good quality estimation of the longer-term probability of loss of structural integrity requires good modelling of the longer-term corrosion behaviour. This is usually associated with anaerobic corrosion. As a result, it cannot be extrapolated from data for short-term corrosion as this is associated with aerobic corrosion conditions.

However, habitats provided by natural substrates are increasingly modified and supplemented by man-made structures. These provide hard surfaces suitable for colonisation by sedentary and/or non-migratory organisms, and may contribute to an interconnected system of benefit to diverse marine populations. Robust assessment of the influence of such structures is, therefore, a necessary consideration for their long-term management. The challenge of compiling and manipulating data for input to two North Sea models is described. Source data were processed and gridded at three different spatial resolutions to investigate the effect of scale on spatial relationships. Choice of grid size was found to exacerbate existing uncertainty in location and extent of features, influencing interpretation of their spatial distributions at the different scales examined. The small spatial footprint of man-made structures, compared with natural substrates, may lead to underestimation of the influence of the former at coarser model scales. Choices must be made between data availability, spatial resolution and accuracy, modelling and analysis requirements, to identify robust approaches to reliable outcomes.

There is little information on individual movements within breeding areas or migratory connections to feeding grounds. We sought to better understand humpback whale habitat use and movements at breeding areas off West Africa, and during the annual migration to Antarctic feeding areas. We also assessed potential overlap between whale habitat and anthropogenic activities. We used Argos satellite-monitored radio tags to collect data on 13 animals off Gabon, a primary humpback whale breeding area. We quantified habitat use for 3 cohorts of whales and used a state-space model to determine transitions in the movement behavior of individuals. We developed a spatial metric of overlap between whale habitat and models of cumulative human activities, including oil platforms, toxicants, and shipping. We detected strong heterogeneity in movement behavior over time that is consistent with previous genetic evidence of multiple populations in the region. Breeding areas for humpback whales in the eastern Atlantic were extensive and extended north of Gabon late in the breeding season. We also observed, for the first time, direct migration between West Africa and sub-Antarctic feeding areas. Potential overlap of whale habitat with human activities was the highest in exclusive economic zones close to shore, particularly in areas used by both individual whales and the hydrocarbon industry. Whales potentially overlapped with different activities during each stage of their migration, which makes it difficult to implement mitigation measures over their entire range. Our results and existing population-level data may inform delimitation of populations and actions to mitigate potential threats to whales as part of local, regional, and international management of highly migratory marine species.

Desarrollamos una metrica espacial de los traslapes entre el habitat de las ballenas y los modelos acumulativos de actividades humanas, incluyendo plataformas petroleras, toxicos y embarcaciones. Detectamos una heterogeneidad fuerte en la conducta del movimiento a lo largo del tiempo que es constante con evidencia genetica previa de poblaciones multiples en la region. Las areas de reproduccion de las ballenas jorobadas en el Atlantico oriental fueron extensas y se extendieron al norte de Gabon mas tarde en la temporada de reproduccion. Tambien observamos, por primera vez, una migracion directa entre las areas de alimentacion de africa occidental y el subantartico. El traslape potencial del habitat de las ballenas con las actividades humanas fue mas alto en las zonas economicas exclusivas cercanas a la costa, particularmente en areas usadas por ballenas individuales y la industria de hidrocarburos.

The sites were located at Garden Banks Area Block 602 (GB 602) and Mississippi Canyon Area Block 292 (MC 292). Near-field sites at both locations were characterized by large numbers of a single undescribed species of harpacticoid copepod, Bathycletopsyllus sp., but this species was essentially absent from far-field sites. We sequenced a 710 bp portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COX I) to analyze the genetic diversity and population structure of Bathycletopsyllus sp. at the two platforms, and to determine if the harpacticoids examined were either a single species, or a complex of cryptic species. We found that divergence at the COX I gene (maximum 1.6%) was within the range observed for intraspecific variability in previously-studied species of harpacticoid copepods that were well-characterized taxonomically. Thus, the two samples analyzed here were a single species and not a complex of cryptic species. In addition, there was significant genetic heterogeneity between the two samples, suggesting limited gene flow between the two sites. This was expected given the low dispersal potential typical of harpacticoids and the distance between the sites (407 km). Lastly, haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were both low in the GB 602 sample, giving a nominally-significant departure from a pure neutral model. This result could indicate the occurrence of selective sweeps, temporal population size variation or other processes not included in the neutral model. In contrast, haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were both higher in the MC 292 sample than at Garden Banks, and there was no detectable departure from neutrality. For both samples, diversity at the haplotype and nucleotide levels were within the range seen in shallow-water harpacticoid species inhabiting both uncontaminated and contaminated muddy sediments, so there was no evidence for pollution related effects in the present study.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,,,0278-0372,1937-240X,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2010-11-01,WOS:000284514100014,,,,,

These colonies bear a resemblance to coral reefs. On brass and bronze plates the colonies are like volcanoes with a cone in the center and a collar of carbonate deposits on the periphery. A number of bacterial species inhabiting sea water are able to form papilla-like colonies. Filamentous bacteria (Leptothrix and Bacillus mycoi-des) cover the metal surface as a film saturated with carbonate. The bacterial colony on this aluminum foil has an acid reaction, which distinguishes it sharply from the alkaline pH of sea water. At the bottom of a bacterial colony energetic process of metal destruction proceeds. The bacterial colony evidently accelerates the electrochemical processes of metal corrosion. Bacterial colonies produce hollow structures with gas bubbles pulsing through them. It is very possible that these structures play the role of energy reactors utilizing the electrical current flowing from metal plates to the sea water for the synthesis of bacterial protein. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Inst.

The oil spills were subsequently observed on different types of satellite images including SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), Chinese HJ-1-B CCD and NASA MODIS. To illustrate the fate of the oil spills, we performed two numerical simulations to simulate the trajectories of the oil spills with the GNOME (General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment) model. For the first time, we drive the GNOME with currents obtained from an operational ocean model (NCOM, Navy Coastal Ocean Model) and surface winds from operational scatterometer measurements (ASCAT, the Advanced Scatterometer). Both data sets are freely and openly available. The initial oil spill location inputs to the model are based on the detected oil spill locations from the SAR images acquired on June 11 and 14. Three oil slicks are tracked simultaneously and our results show good agreement between model simulations and subsequent satellite observations in the semi-enclosed shallow sea. Moreover, GNOME simulation shows that the number of 'splots', which denotes the extent of spilled oil, is a vital factor for GNOME running stability when the number is less than 500. Therefore, oil spill area information obtained from satellite sensors, especially SAR, is an important factor for setting up the initial model conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a growing demand for predictive models of porpoise distribution to assess the extent of potential conflicts and to support conservation and management plans. Here, we used a range of oceanographic parameters and generalised additive models to predict harbour porpoise density and to investigate seasonal shifts in porpoise distribution in relation to several static and dynamic predictors. Sightings were collected during dedicated line-transect aerial surveys conducted year-round between 2002 and 2005. Over the 4 yr, survey effort amounted to 38720 km, during which 3887 harbour porpoises were sighted. Porpoises aggregated in distinct hot spots within their seasonal range, but the importance of key habitat descriptors varied between seasons. Predictors explaining most of the variance were the hydrographical parameter 'residual current' and proxies for primary production and fronts (chlorophyll and nutrients) as well as the interaction 'distance to coast/water depth'. Porpoises preferred areas with stronger currents and concentrated in areas where fronts are likely. Internal cross-validation indicated that all models were highly robust. In addition, we successfully externally validated our summer model using an independent data set, which allowed us to extrapolate our predictions to a more regional scale. Our models improve the understanding of determinants of harbour porpoise habitat in the North Sea as a whole and inform management frameworks to determine safe limits of anthropogenic impacts.",,,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,41,0,50,,,1863-5407,1613-4796,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Kiel, Res and Technol Ctr FTZ, D-25761 Busum, Germany",,,,2011-10-28,BCI:BCI201100669512,,,,,

The Pacific coast of the Isthmus also contains a significant wetland complex that supports large multi-species aggregations of non-breeding waterbirds during the boreal winter. In recent years, extensive wind energy development has occurred in the plains bordering these wetlands, directly along the migratory flyway. Using recent studies of movement patterns of three marine-associated bird speciesreddish egrets (Egretta rufescens), brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), and red knots (Calidris canutus)from the northern Gulf of Mexico, we assess the use of the isthmus as a migratory corridor. Our data provide evidence that marine birds from the Gulf region regularly overwinter along the Pacific coast of Mexico and use the isthmus as a migratory corridor, creating the potential for interaction with terrestrial wind farms during non-breeding. This study is the first to describe migration by marine-associated bird species between the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific coast. These data contribute new information toward ongoing efforts to understand the complex migration patterns of mobile marine species, with the goal of informing integrated conservation efforts for species whose year-round habitat needs cross ecoregional and geopolitical boundaries.

In addition to well-documented microplants, macroalgae, and microbial buildups, abundant microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS) and mat-related sediments have been recognized in these rocks. Intensive microbial mat layers and MISS are especially well preserved in the carbonates of the upper Gaoyuzhuang (ca. 1.5 Ga) and lower Wumishan (ca. 1.45 Ga) formations, indicating diversified microbial activities and a high organic production. In these petrified biomats, putative microbial fossils (both coccoidal and filamentous) and framboidal pyrites have been identified. The abundance of authigenic carbonate minerals in the host rocks, such as, acicular aragonites, rosette barites, radial siderites, ankerites, and botryoidal carbonate cements, suggests authigenic carbonate precipitation from anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) under anoxic/euxinic conditions. Warm climate and anoxic/euxinic conditions in the Mesoproterozoic oceans may have facilitated high microbial productivity and organic burial in sediments. Although authigenic carbonate cements may record carbonate precipitation from anaerobic methane oxidation, gas blister (or dome) structures may indicate gas release from active methanogenesis during shallow burial. Bituminous fragments in mat-related carbonates also provide evidence for hydrocarbon generation. Under proper conditions, the Mesoproterozoic mat-rich carbonates will have the potential for hydrocarbon generation and serve as source rocks. On the basis of petrified biomats, a rough estimation suggests that the Mesoproterozoic carbonates of the North China platform might have a hydrocarbon production potential in the order of 10 x 10(8) t.",,,,,,,,,24,6,0,0,7,0,30,,,1002-0705,,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Geol Proc & Mineral Resources, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R ChinaUniv Nevada, Dept Geosci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",,,,2008-10-01,WOS:000260561000012,,,,,

This paper summarises how TSW developments could affect seabirds, based on experience from other forms of disturbance, and explores the possible changes in behaviour and habitat that have the potential to increase a seabird's rate of energy acquisition (e.g. through enhancing prey abundance), or energy expenditure (e.g. through causing birds to commute further to find food, if they avoid foraging around developments placed in regular feeding areas). Changes to energy budgets could impact rates of reproduction and survival. Simulation modelling of seabird energetics and behaviour is one possible tool for predicting the direction and magnitude of population impacts caused by alterations to energy budgets, but is dependant on the availability and accuracy of necessary parameters. The later sections of the paper review the information needed for such models and shows that although some data are available regarding rates of energy expenditure during specific activities, more information is needed on seabird foraging rates. The paper also highlights how the susceptibility of a species to be impacted by future TSW development is likely to be related to their method of foraging, flight behaviour and ability to buffer against environmental fluctuations.

Arguably, the largest impact will be upon the fishing industry where access loss may lead to displacement and reduced catch per unit effort in turn leading to conflict. To prevent conflict, it is important to understand mitigating factors. Marine renewable energy devices (MREDs) and associated infrastructure will be placed on the seabed, affecting benthic infauna and epifauna, important sources of food for many species including those of commercial importance, potentially providing benefits to the fishing industry and mitigating the causes of conflict. Two key plausible benefits of MREDs are the 'artificial reef effect' and the 'exclusion zone effect'. This study investigated the utility of the Ecopath with Ecosim and Ecospace modelling software to address the implications of these 'effects'. Two case study models were developed, one at the whole west coast of Scotland shelf scale and one at a smaller single installation scale. Our results suggested that the Ecospace model could potentially predict the effects of MRED installations, but revealed that there are a number of considerations which should be taken into account before attempting to do this. Key considerations include data availability (an issue in all modelling), spatial scale and resolution. Other limitations to this particular study such as the ability to make changes over time are currently being addressed by ongoing developments of the software. Despite the considerations and limitations, these case studies reveal the usefulness of spatial ecosystem modelling, particularly Ecospace, to investigate this issue. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Integrating disparate datasets (including old and new knowledge) is a challenge for any location, but is increasingly important given the expansion of the marine industries constituting the blue economy. This is particularly so when industries operate in frontier, or remote regions with high conservation significance. Ecosystem models are an integration tool that can give insight into the structure and function of marine systems and act as a testbed for exploring scenarios of development for the region. Two of the most widely used ecosystem models (Atlantis and Ecopath with Ecosim) were implemented for the GAB, to allow an exploration of development scenarios and to provide tools in support of future management of the GAB's socioecological systems. The models were used to evaluate the vulnerability of key species, food webs, habitats and animal groupings to ecosystem stressors such as climate change, fisheries, disease, changing spatial management, aquaculture and oil spills. The models' responses to cessation of fishing indicate that the anthropogenic signature is not 'untouched', but is not yet substantially degraded. The complexity and confined area of much of the natural and anthropogenic activity in the region, which is highly concentrated in the gulfs and along the shoreline, means the system is sufficiently interlinked for cumulative nonlinear outcomes to occur if the system is sufficiently stressed. Scenarios of increased fishing pressure had the greatest impacts on individual functional groups, while scenarios of ocean warming had the greatest influence on ecosystem structure and integrity. Oil spill scenarios (e.g. caused by potential off-shore shipping accidents) had potential impacts on seabirds, pelagic fishes and marine mammals, with flow-on effects to the whole ecosystem, but only in a confined area immediately around the incident's footprint. These results give scientists and managers insights into how expanding the blue economy could impact ecosystem services and the societies currently dependent on them.

Deepwater coral communities are hotspots of diversity and biomass. Most deep-sea coral species are long-lived and slow-growing and are, thus, expected to recover slowly after disturbance. A better understanding of the recovery potential of these organisms is necessary to make appropriate management decisions.2. We used data from high-resolution monitoring of individual coral colonies that were impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (April 2010) to parameterize and validate an annual, impact-dependent, state-structured matrix model to estimate the time to recovery for each coral colony. We projected the dynamics of three branch states: visibly healthy, unhealthy and hydroid-colonized. Although we implicitly included branch loss in the model, we focused on the short-term return of extant, damaged branches to a visibly healthy state and did not consider the far longer term regrowth of lost branches.3. Our model estimates that, depending on the initial level of impact, corals impacted by the spill will take up to three decades to recover to a state where all remaining branches appear healthy, though the majority of corals are projected to reach that state within a decade. By that time, some of these colonies will have lost a significant number of branches, leading to approximately 10% reduction in total biomass at all impacted sites.4. Overall, our model overestimates recovery, but branch loss estimates were reliable. Thus, the available growth rate data suggest that hundreds of years may be necessary for impacted communities to grow back to their initial biomass.5. Policy implications. Our study quantifies the very slow recovery rate of deep-sea corals impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and demonstrates the imperative of prioritizing a precautionary approach for deep-sea ecosystems over restoration after the fact. As anthropogenic pressure on the deep sea is likely to increase, we suggest the establishment of coral monitoring sites implemented as part of Marine Protected Areas to limit and detect impact to deep-sea corals. Furthermore, our model may be used to plan shorter-and longer-term monitoring programmes after impact and to provide a timeline for policy.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,19,0,23,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,,,2018-06-28,WOS:000434970200024,,,,,

Endophytes are fungal and bacterial symbionts of plants that can affect performance. As in more widely known symbioses, acute or chronic stressor exposure might trigger disassociation of endophytes from host plants. We tested this hypothesis by examining the effects of oil exposure following the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill on endophyte diversity and abundance in Spartina alterniflora - the foundational plant in northern Gulf coast salt marshes affected by the spill. We compared bacterial and fungal endophytes isolated from plants in reference areas to isolates from plants collected in areas with residual oil that has persisted for more than three years after the DWH spill. DNA sequence-based estimates showed that oil exposure shifted endophyte diversity and community structure. Plants from oiled areas exhibited near total loss of leaf fungal endophytes. Root fungal endophytes exhibited a more modest decline and little change was observed in endophytic bacterial diversity or abundance, though a shift towards hydrocarbon metabolizers was found in plants from oiled sites. These results show that plant-endophyte symbioses can be disrupted by stressor exposure, and indicate that symbiont community disassembly in marsh plants is an enduring outcome of the DWH spill.",,,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,31,0,47,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USATulane Univ, Tulane Xavier Ctr Bioenvironm Res, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",,,,2015-04-29,WOS:000353711600012,25923203,,,,

Motivated by Brazil's large territory and population size, wide-ranging geographic features, and economic and social issues, we intend to solve problems related to security and environment. This INCT will address some of these challenges by proposing novel networked robotic systems for underwater maintenance, automobile and cargo transportation grow crops, remote inspection and actuation, and surveillance. Oil extraction in the pre-salt layer, located 250Km from the coast and more than 2 km deep in the ocean, has demanded specific solutions in terms of logistics, maintenance in deep waters, remote operations of platforms, and national security. Urban mobility has been faced with an expressive growing in the number of automobiles in the last years, the Brazilian car fleet is now the 4th in the world, car manufacturers and robotics researchers have been interested in partial or full automation of vehicles navigation systems. In terms of Amazon rainforest and Agriculture, Brazil has the important and complementary objectives in terms of preservation and to increase crop productivity. Advances in communication, computing, and embedded control technologies allow the application of networked systems to large environmental monitoring and coordination of multiple mobile agents for exploration and manipulation. The latest advances in systems theory and emerging information technology to enable the design and implementation of distributed networks for observation, mobility, and manipulation provide the fundamental scope of actual problems we intend to solve. Specifically, this proposal will consider autonomous navigation of aerial vehicles in low altitude to deal, for instance, with power transmission line and gas pipe inspection to alleviate the pilot's workload and with motion planning strategies for aggressive landing of an actual cargo transportation helicopter in a mobile platform; robotic systems based on lighter-than-air vehicles for environmental monitoring, surveillance and communication applied to the Amazon region. They will provide a virtual sensory barriers against deforestation, telecommunication services to remote and small population areas, technological solutions to coastal communities and remote settlements; Modeling and design of autonomous heavy vehicles with on-line payload measurement system. Advanced driver assistance systems will be developed to deal with safety, congestion and traffic cooperation, and with overloading freight transportation; coordination of heterogeneous aerial and mobile robots in outdoor environment to deal with helicopters and convoy of trucks based on fault tolerant control systems; coordination of heterogeneous robots applied to orange plantation monitoring. This project aims to estimate the amount of fruits, pest detection, the rate of development and degree of maturity of the plants; modeling and design of distributed underwater vehicles for inspection and service of industrial installations. They will deal with servicing, repair, and assembly tasks of oil and gas platforms. Basic development for autonomous and fault tolerant control systems. It will be related with development of control techniques for systems under stochastic variations in its dynamics, with the development of measurement based approach to engineering design and techniques for system identification, and with control of small robots described by swarms of insects which will be performed based on bio-inspired systems. This INCT will bring together an outstanding set of universities, industries, and research institutes of Brazil and abroad.

Appropriate assessment of the foundations capacity of these structures is thus necessary, especially when these structures are supported by pile groups. The pile group interaction effects under lateral loading have been investigated intensively in past decades, and the most of the conducted studies have considered lateral loading that acts along one of the two orthogonal directions, parallel to the edge of pile group. However, because of the stochastic nature of its source, the horizontal loading on the pile group may have arbitrary direction. The number of studies dealing with the pile groups under arbitrary loading is very limited. The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of the arbitrary lateral loading on the pile group response, in order to improve (extend) the current design approach for laterally loaded pile groups. Free head, flexible bored piles in sand were analyzed through the extensive numerical study. The main hypothesis of the research is that some critical pile group configurations, loading directions, and soil conditions exist, which can lead to the unsafe structural design. Critical pile positions inside the commonly used pile group configurations are identified with respect to loading directions.

Sampling of the Terminos Lagoon (Mexico) was carried out in November 2009 in order to understand the influence of these particular environmental conditions on organic matter fluxes within the lagoon's pelagic ecosystem and, more specifically, on the relationship between phyto-and bacterioplankton communities. The measurements presented here concern biogeochemical parameters (nutrients, dissolved and particulate organic matter [POM], and dissolved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]), phytoplankton (biomass and photosynthesis), and bacteria (diversity and abundance, including PAH degradation bacteria and ectoenzymatic activities). During the studied period, the water column of the Terminos Lagoon functioned globally as a sink and, more precisely, as a nitrogen assimilator. This was due to the high production of particulate and dissolved organic matter (DOM), even though exportation of autochthonous matter to the Gulf of Mexico was weak. We found that bottom-up control accounted for a large portion of the variability of phytoplankton productivity. Nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry mostly accounted for the heterogeneity in phytoplankton and free-living prokaryote distribution in the lagoon. In the eastern part, we found a clear decoupling between areas enriched in dissolved inorganic nitrogen near the Puerto Real coastal inlet and areas enriched in phosphate (PO4) near the Candelaria estuary. Such a decoupling limited the potential for primary production, resulting in an accumulation of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON, respectively) near the river mouths. In the western part of the lagoon, maximal phytoplankton development resulted from bacterial activity transforming particulate organic phosphorus (PP) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) to available PO4 and the coupling between Palizada River inputs of nitrate (NO3) and PP. The Chumpan River contributed only marginally to PO4 inputs due to its very low contribution to overall river inputs. The highest dissolved total PAH concentrations were measured in the El Carmen Inlet, suggesting that the anthropogenic pollution of the zone is probably related to the oil-platform exploitation activities in the shallow waters of the southern of the Gulf of Mexico. We also found that a complex array of biogeochemical and phytoplanktonic parameters were the driving force behind the geographical distribution of bacterial community structure and activities. Finally, we showed that nutrients brought by the Palizada River supported an abundant bacterial community of PAH degraders, which are of significance in this important oil-production zone.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,9,1,15,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,,,,,,"UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Lab Oceanog Microbienne LOMIC, Sorbonne Univ,Observ Oceanol, F-66650 Banyuls Sur Mer, FranceUniv Autonoma Metropolitana, Dept Hidrobiol, Mexico City, DF, MexicoUniv Toulon & Var, CNRS, Aix Marseille Univ, INSU,IRD,MIO,UM 110, F-13288 Marseille, France",,,,2017-03-29,WOS:000395322100001,,,,,

It is concluded that such a reduction may be attributed to mineral oil pollution caused by accidental spills or by the process of petroleum extraction where hydrogen sulphide and other sulphur components escape to the biosphere. Thus the presence of marine macro- and microorganisms has been modified in a short time during this century. Consequently, trematodes life-cycle has been broken, since both intermediate and potential hosts and habitats, as well as free-living trematode larvae, are seriously affected. Therefore the opportunities for a successful infestation is reduced, and adult parasites are absent in fishes. Eventually the presence of hydrogen sulphide in the marine atmosphere seems to affect also the life and health of men working at petroleum drilling platforms. This pollution affects the ecology and local economy, because the integrity of shellfishes is impaired.

Understanding and accurately predicting the meteorology offshore is fundamental to efficient integration of these future wind farms into an electrical grid. Particular interest is focused on anticipating and reducing errors associated with wind ramps, which are characterized by rapid, sustained changes in wind speed over a period of hours. Using meteorological observations from a coastal buoy, we characterize 428 wind ramp-ups between 2005 and 2012 in terms of frequency, duration and magnitude, time and date of occurrence, and large-scale synoptics. From this group, we select 24 case studies that represent typical and extreme ramp-ups at this location and then model the impact that the forecasting error of these ramp-ups could have on the electrical grid. The case studies are modeled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and compared with nearby buoy observations to assess forecast errors in ramp-up timing, shape, and magnitude. WRF frequently simulated ramp-ups too early, relative to observations, and often predicted the pre-ramp-up wind speed to be too high or the post-ramp-up wind speed to be too low. In the case of August 14, 2007, all three forecast errors occurred. The simulated impact on the grid is calculated by comparing the errors in forecast power with concurrent electrical load data in PJM's Mid-Atlantic Area Council-East (PJM-E) region. The largest impacts on the electrical grid were found to occur in the winter or at night in the summer. This framework allows for the identification of events that would potentially cause problems for the electrical grid in the PJM-E region.

Social opposition to wind farms grows daily, and people allied with social movements, associations, human rights organizations, and universities have made many local interventions to stop construction. This research aims to demonstrate that even though investments in Brazilian wind power, especially Ceará state, were based on a conservationist and regionalist discourse, wind power benefits actually flow to outside groups without financial returns accruing locally, and, even worse, causing material and non-material damages to people who live near wind farms. This study reveals that laws regulating wind-power development in Brazil facilitate the implementation of wind farms to the detriment of broad social acceptance because it is a means to make local residents invisible, as in the case of exclusion of communities on maps used to obtain environmental licenses or land-title fraud (grilagem) of collective and historical land claims. Finally, we suggest measures for better control of policies for wind-farm development in Ceará that would make it possible for communities to negotiate as equals with wind-power investors and obtain benefits from the profitability of wind-power generation.","Resumen Aunque la energia eólica sea considerada como una fuente energética limpia, las investigaciones muestran que la implantación de campos eólicos en el nordeste brasileño está generando diversos impactos sociales e ambientales negtivos a las poblaciones que se encuentran en el litoral, especialmente a los pescadores tradicionales, a los campesinos, a los quilombolas y a los pueblos indígenas.

This measure intends to prevent the decline of the stocks, caused specially by the tuna fleet operating with live bait in that region.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1021-5212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2007-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14311069066,,,,,

The conventional method of predicting the restart pressure for gelled crude oil assumes a constant yield stress across and along the pipe section; this often leads to excessive over sizing of pump and piping system. Many researches highlighted that the presence of gas voids upon cooling of waxy crude may have an impact on the yield stress of gelled crude. This paper describes the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to investigate the formation behaviour of gas voids within a gelled crude oil sample from a field in the South China Sea. Scanning of gelled crude at selected temperatures was performed following cooling in the circular pipe section within an experimental flow loop rig. Gas voids within the range of 7-12% were observed in the gelled samples resulted from different cooling temperatures and cooling rates. The cooling temperature and cooling rates were observed to influence significantly the location and volume of gas voids formed within the gelled samples. Higher cooling rates resulted in higher volume of gas voids close to pipe wall while lower cooling rates resulted in more gas voids located around core of the pipe. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

These organisms play an integral role in the ecosystems of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), where not only are they a keystone species, but are also socioeconomically important. The survival of embryonated eggs is necessary to ensure adequate recruitment into the next generation. Because the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DWH) occurred during the peak of the blue crab spawning season, the incident likely impacted blue crab embryos. In order to assess the effect of oil on embryonic growth and development, we collected embryonated eggs from seven different female blue crabs from the GOM throughout the spawning season and exposed them to an oil concentration of 500 ppb (the approximate concentration of oil at the surface water near the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig). Exposure to oil at this concentration caused a significantly larger proportion of prezoeae vs. zoeae to hatch from embryonated eggs in experiments lasting longer than 4 days. Exposure to oil did not significantly affect overall survival or development rate. The prezoeal stage is a little-studied stage of blue crab development. Though it may or may not be a normal stage of development, this stage has been found to occur in suboptimal conditions and has lower survival than zoeal stages. The larger proportion of prezoeae following prolonged exposure to oil thus indicates that crude oil at concentrations likely to be experienced by crabs after the DWH spill negatively impacted the development of blue crab embryos. In addition to providing insight into the effects of the DWH, this study sheds light on embryonic development in blue crabs, a critical, but poorly investigated phase of this important species' life cycle.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,2167-8359,,,,,,,,,,,"Brooklyn Law Sch, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USATulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",Brooklyn Law Sch,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000452727300001,30581659,,,,

The work is advancing a fundamental understanding of soil-structure interactions to develop a novel and sustainable foundation concept for offshore wind turbines: a Flying Wing Anchor. This anchor is a steel plate in the shape of an aerodynamically efficient winged aircraft. The anchor is installed silently and efficiently using gravity from free fall through the water column and penetration into the sea floor. Tension in the line that attaches the wind turbine structure to the anchor causes the anchor to dive and pitch toward the horizontal in service, maximizing the available holding capacity in bearing over the full wing surface in an extreme load. The intellectual challenges are (1) modeling the resistance of soil against a foundation in shear and bearing over the orders-of-magnitude range of strain rates corresponding to free-fall penetration, line pre-tensioning and ultimately storm loading and (2) capturing the dynamic, fully six-degree-of-freedom movement of a foundation as it flies through the soil during installation and service. The research plan comprises a comprehensive approach to physically testing scale models of a Flying Wing Anchor during penetration and in-service loading and numerically modeling the three-dimensional behavior with time of a Flying Wing Anchor with the Finite Element Method (FEM) and advanced constitutive models. It capitalizes on a U.S.-Ireland Research and Development Partnership Program to bring together a multidisciplinary, multiple-institution team that represents the European state-of-the art in offshore wind development and the U.S. state-of-the-art in offshore foundations. The project partners include The University of Texas at Austin, the University of Rhode Island, University College Dublin and Queen's University Belfast. With external funding from Invest NI and Science Foundation Ireland, the U.S. investment in this project is leveraged at a ratio of nearly 3 total dollars for each dollar invested from NSF. This research has the potential to improve foundation systems over a wide range of offshore and onshore applications by developing a green foundation concept, where nature initially installs it through gravity and then completes the installation through in-service loading. This research aims to reduce the economic and environmental cost of harnessing offshore wind energy, which is a key challenge to increasing the availability of renewable energy. This research will benefit society at large by providing cross-country and cross-Atlantic education and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, by fostering excitement in engineering and science for school children through exposing them to the development of a novel concept and giving them an opportunity to examine it themselves through a model testing facility, and by increasing public awareness of the promises and challenges of renewable energy through public demonstrations and workshops.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1300142,,,,,,,,University of Rhode Island,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14032996,,,,,

The expression of CYP1A, CYP2M1- and 2K1-like proteins was examined for use as possible biomarkers of PFW exposure. A pilot study at the Harriet A production platform, on the Northwest Shelf of Australia, had indicated that PFW contamination possibly contributes to induction of CYP1A- and 2K1/2M1-like proteins in Gold-Spotted Trevally (Carangoides fulvoguttatus). In a subsequent caged fish study in the same location, Stripey seaperch (Lutjanus carponotatus) were caught at a clean site, then distributed to three caging sites: A (near-field), B (far-field) and C (a non-impacted reference site). Fish were sampled at time T = 0, 3 and 10 days. Significant increases of CYP1A, one CYP2K1- and two CYP2M1-like proteins were noted at Site A at T = 10. For another CYP2K1-like protein, a significant increase was observed at Site A only at T = 3. Prevailing winds changed between days 6 and 8 of sampling, moving the surface water plume directly west, possibly impacting in situ PFW exposure. The results indicate that tropical fish CYPIA protein is sensitive to PFW exposure. Importantly, statistically significant environmental induction of both CYP2M1- and CYP2K1-like proteins in tropical fish due to PFW exposure had not previously been described and CYP2 family induction may represent possible new biomarkers (other than CYP1A) of PFW exposure. In addition, the novel fraction-specific response of CYP2K-like proteins requires further verification but offers promise for improved monitoring of sub-lethal responses in marine organisms.

Criteria range from broadband levels to frequency weighted received sound levels. The associated differences in impact assessment results are, however, not yet understood. This uncertainty makes environmental management of transboundary anthropogenic noise challenging and causes confusion for regulators who need to choose appropriate exposure criteria. In the present study, three established exposure criteria frameworks from Germany, Denmark, and the US were used to analyse the effect of impact pile driving at a location in the Baltic Sea on harbor porpoise and harbor seal hearing. The acoustic modeling using MIKE showed that an unmitigated scenario would lead to auditory injury for all three criteria. Despite readily apparent variances in impact ranges among the applied approaches, it was also evident that noise mitigation measures could reduce underwater sound to levels where auditory injuries would be unlikely in most cases. It was concluded that each of the frameworks has its own advantages and disadvantages. Single noise exposure criteria follow the precautionary principle and can be enforced relatively easily, whereas criteria that consider hearing capabilities and animal response movement can improve the accuracy of the assessment if data are available.

The current generation of sea ice models is not capable of reproducing certain aspects of landfast ice behavior, for example the persistence of landfast sea ice under the effect of offshore winds. The authors develop a landfast sea ice model by adding tensile strength to the viscous-plastic as well as two versions of the elastic-viscous-plastic sea ice rheologies. One-dimensional implementations of these rheologies are used to explore the ability of coastal sea ice to resist offshore winds over extended times. While all modified rheologies are capable of maintaining landfast ice-like structures in the model, only the viscous-plastic rheology fulfills theoretical expectations. The elastic-viscous-plastic rheologies show initial elastic waves that weaken the ice and thus reduce its capacity of maintaining landfast ice. Further, special care has to be taken when implementing the most commonly used version of the elastic-viscous-plastic rheology because the standard set of parameters is not adequate for landfast sea ice modeling.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,3,0,37,,,0022-3670,1520-0485,,,,,,,,,,"NYU, New York, NY USA",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000273899200011,,,,,

Therefore the site appeared to be suited for multi-purpose designs with fish farming and wind energy as potential activities. An Ecosystem Services Approach (ESA) is adopted to identify possible environmental effects and conflicts with other relevant uses. We deal with these potential impacts by choosing a suitable location of the platform. Limited financial data on wind energy suggested a negative Net Present Value (NPV), whereas proper financial data on fish farming produced a slightly positive NPV. A Life Cycle Assessment applied to wind energy and fish farming estimated a significantly positive effect from reduced CO2-eq emissions expressed in euros. A Social Cost-Benefit Analysis (SCBA) applied only to fish farming (i.e., including financial and CO2 results) due to lack of data and resulted on a positive NPV. However, a MUP is not recommended by SCBA, and more explicitly it is not supported by stakeholders in the short-run.

Our laboratory has been conducting surveys over ten years of the intertidal organisms of Port Jackson, most intensively the rock platforms, with funding from the Shell Co who wished to establish a baseline against which damage caused by an oil spill could be assessed. This enabled us to implement a 'before and after, control and impact' (BACI) monitoring design for the assessment of environmental harm caused by the oil spill, using temporal replication at a number of sites within Port Jackson. With baseline data in hand, this study represents one of the few occasions on which it has been possible to assess accurately both impact and recovery of biological communities in response to such a contamination event. Results showed that the three main sites subjected to the spill exhibited evidence of impact in terms of lowered abundances and changes in community structure as compared with pre-spill conditions and the reference site. Two of the impacted sites subsequently showed increases of the opportunistic, limpet-like Siphonaria denticulata, and other species imbalances, including the lack of recovery at one of the sites of the gastropod Austrocochlea porcata (previously A. constricta). However, all three impacted sites showed signs of recovery over the 12-month post-spill period. Further changes in species balance, and hence community structure, can be expected to continue at these sites over the next several years as part of post-spill recovery.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,8,0,10,,,1323-3475,,,,,,,,,,,"School of Environmental and Life Sciences, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia",,,,2003-01-01,BCI:BCI200300569842,,,,,

Industrial discharge exerted the highest impact on the copepod population by decreasing its density to less than 500 ind./m(3). Despite the decrease in copepod abundance during high flow of sewage, the impacted area sustained the maximum copepod density low discharge i.e. 11,222 ind./m(3) due to presence of available food. The acceptable water quality characteristics and high nutritive nature of the agricultural runoff increased the copepod density and diversity. Euterpina acutifrons, Oithona nana and Paracalanus parvus showed high resistivity to pollution levels, blooming always near the discharge points. Harpacticoids showed high capacity to withstand industrial discharge more than Calanoids and Cyclopoids. Diversity indices for the area heavily affected by agricultural discharge (1.8 - 2.6) were higher than for the areas impacted by sewage (1.6 - 1.9), mixed agricultural/industrial (1.4 - 1.6) and industrial (0.6 - 0.8) discharge. Freshwater species were recorded at nearshore stations opposite agricultural runoff where salinity declined to < 10 psu. Multiple regression equations proved that the copepod community structure is influenced by various environmental factors which differed according to the water quality in the four investigated areas. While temperature and oxygen were not effectively involved in copepod community structure variations, pollution by Hg and oil seemed to suppress copepods abundance at areas impacted by industrial discharges.

To find out the towing dynamic behaviors of the OIMM with different drafts, mooring positions, towing velocities and towrope lengths in various sea conditions, the hydrodynamic analyses were carried out by using MOSES. The OIMM model in prototype scale was established in MOSES to simulate the static stability and dynamic responses induced by coupled wave and wind conditions. A small tugboat and a single towrope are employed for this towing system. The results show that the OIMM has sufficient intact stability and acceptable damage stability for its inner subdivision configuration. The towrope length exerts the most impact on fluctuation response than draft and mooring positions. Draft depths and mooring positions impact more on pitch motion than on heave motion.

We set up a field campaign to compare and validate outputs from different radar systems.2. Here we compare the pattern of nocturnal bird migration movements recorded by four different radar systems at a site in southern Sweden. Within the range of the weather radar (WR) Angelholm, we operated a BirdScan (BS) dedicated bird radar, a standard marine radar (MR), and a tracking radar (TR).3. The measures of nightly migration intensities, provided by three of the radars (WR, BS, MR), corresponded well with respect to the relative seasonal course of migration, while absolute migration intensity agreed reasonably only between WR and BS. Flight directions derived from WR, BS and TR corresponded very well, despite very different sample sizes. Estimated mean ground speeds differed among all four systems. The correspondence among systems was highest under clear sky conditions and at high altitudes.4. Synthesis and applications. While different radar systems can provide useful information on nocturnal bird migration, they have distinct strengths and weaknesses, and all require supporting data to allow for species level inference. Weather radars continuously detect avian biomass flows across a wide altitude band, making them a useful tool for monitoring and predictive applications at regional to continental scales that do not rely on resolving individuals. BirdScan and marine radar's strengths are in local and low altitude applications, such as collision risks with man-made structures and airport safety, although marine radars should not be trusted for absolute intensities of movement. In quantifying flight behaviour of individuals, tracking radars are the most informative.",,,,,,,,,39,2,0,0,24,0,45,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Swiss Ornithol Inst, Sempach, SwitzerlandLund Univ, Lund, SwedenCornell Univ, Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY USAUniv Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Theoret & Computat Ecol, Amsterdam, NetherlandsMax Planck Inst Ornithol, Radolfzell am Bodensee, GermanyOrnis Ital, Rome, ItalySwedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Norrkoping, SwedenUniv Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Cornwall, EnglandUniv Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Cornwall, EnglandNanjing Agr Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaRoyal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands",Ornis Ital,,,2018-10-25,WOS:000447296300004,,,,,

The surface signatures of ISWs can be detected using remote sensing instruments like Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and sunglint true-colour images. The present study makes an effort to delineate as well as detect the possible potential generation locations of mode-1 long living ISWs in the Andaman Sea using remote sensing observations. To accomplish this, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) true-colour images of Terra/Aqua satellites for the months of March and April during 2014-2016 are used to map the distribution and propagation characteristics of ISWs. These maps along with SAR imgaes from ENVISAT and TerraSAR-X are used to detect the possible generation locations of ISWs. The study considers the possible generation location of ISW as the circumcentre of each wave packet as they radially propagate along a two-dimensional frame. The analysis reveals five potential ISW generation hotspots that are distributed along the Northern Andaman Sea, as well as locations in the discontinuities off the Nicobar Islands and the great passage.

To properly use the OBS seismic data, we must adopt the method that is different from conventional seismic data processing method, in this paper we proposed a new method which used the method of mirror time migration of pre-stack processing. The method includes the OBS data vector fidelity processing, the P (pressure) and Z (vertical) component of the pre-stack processing and image of pre-stack time migration processing; the vector fidelity processing is to control and correct the positioning in space (x, y, z) and in time (clock drift), and the geophone sensor orientation (vertical and horizontal components); the P and Z component of the pre-stack processing includes zero phase processing and seismic- channel correcting, P and Z summation, residual static correction, image superposition and multiple attenuation; mirroring the pre-stack time migration processing is to use the multiple wave imaging technology.

Earlier entry has typically been accompanied by considerably greater in-river mortality. We examine this behavioral change using correlation analyses between the entry timing of the Adams River and Weaver Creek stocks and the surface marine conditions encountered by the stocks during their homing migration from the northeast Pacific several months earlier. For Adams stocks, maximum correlation is between entry timing and offshore winds, such that the weaker the wind stress in the direction of the prevailing surface currents in early July, the earlier the river entry in late summer. For Weaver stocks, maximum correlation is with salinity, such that the lower the surface salinity along the coast in August, the earlier the river entry. We hypothesize that oceanic changes lead to changes in late-run sockeye physiology which then leads to changes in behavior. Physiological changes are postulated to arise from two types of preconditioning: Type-1 occurs in the offshore region, whereby the weaker the prevailing currents that normally hinder eastward migration, the more endogenous energy available for maturation and the earlier the river entry. Type-2 occurs in coastal regions, whereby the lower the salinity, the more rapid the osmoregulatory adaptation to freshwater (and possible susceptibility to water-borne pathogens) and the earlier the entry. Results suggest that the earlier entry that began in the mid-1990s is linked to weaker ocean currents and lower coastal salinities.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,15,0,17,,,1054-6006,1365-2419,,,,,,,,,,"Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Ocean Sci, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000285205300004,,,,,

Those areas that were studied were graded according to three levels of vulnerability or risk, taking into account overall numbers of birds at different seasons, as well as their proximity to sources of pollution.

Exposure of oysters to a range of oil/HEWAF (0-7-66-147-908-3450 mu g tPAH50 (sum of 50 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) L-1) resulted in non-dose-dependent mortalities and reduced clearance rates of algal food (Tisochrysis lutea).

In autumn and spring, soprano pipistrelles appear in areas where the species is not recorded during the summer. This also seems to be the case along other large Norwegian fiords (e.g. the fiord Hardangerfiorden in Hordaland county), but no banding effort has been made to confirm this (detector surveys only). Use of Sussex Auto bat (U.K) and puppet hair nets, automatic recording devices (batcorder system from EcoObs, Germany) and radio telemetry suggest that soprano pipistrelles will not undertake longer movements (e.g. to islands off the coast) in this region, but rather that this species avoid the extreme western parts with the strongest oceanic influence. This is also supported by records from bat boxes (Schwegler and BCI-type) over an east-west gradient.Whiskered bats Myotis mystacinus is rare or void in some oceanic sections of western Norway, but appear here in September. Daubenton's bats Myotis daubentonii can move from islands and to the mainland (one record), but on islands without freshwater habitats, no records of Myotis spp. has been made.The northern bat Eptesicus nilssonii is a very common species on the mainland and on large islands. On smaller islands it is void in summer, but appears there in autumn, even more that 10 km off the coast. Data from automatic recording devices show that the species may concentrate at the end of headlands in autumn and movements off to sea here is a possibility.With minimum effort, rare species such as the parti-coloured bat Vespertilio murinus, have been recorded on islands in autumn and not in summer, suggesting at least some movements of this species along the coast in western Norway. A single record of a serotine bat Eptesicus serotinus has been made at one island of the coast of western Norway (2 September 2011, on the island Vigra, Giske municipality, More og Romsdal county, 62 degrees 32' N 06 degrees 00' E). The ultrasound recording was determined to species by Ingemar AHLEN, Hans J. BAAGOE and Kjell ISAKSEN (all with knowledge of the site where the recording was made). The status of the latter species in Norway is uncertain. It may be a ship assisted individual or there may be a small undetected population. Too little effort has been made to map species in much of western Norway to exclude the existence of populations of this species here.Some records of the Nathusius' pipistrelle Pipistrellus nathusii have been made on oil installations in Norwegian territories and one such record is reported here from the Troll oil field in the North Sea in Norwegian territory in May 2011. This bat landed on a support ship and was released when the ship returned to mainland Norway. A noctule Nyctalus noctula has been confirmed from one island of the coast during migration season and possible noctules have been found on oilrigs in the North Sea.Even though a member of Eurobats (since 1994), responsible government authorities in Norway does not direct companies building wind farms to include bats in environmental impact assessments (eg. as recommended in Eurobats Publication series no. 3), thus bats does not receive any meaningful attention in plans to erect windmills. Several such projects are now being realized without any knowledge about the possible effect on bat populations and without any knowledge about which species can be found in these project areas.

OOS are designed to monitor environmental, oceanographic, and atmospheric parameters and can be installed on a variety of offshore platforms. In the summer of 2009, a multi-disciplinary real-time OOS, Galveston Instrument Garden for Environmental Monitoring (GIGEM), was deployed off the coast of Galveston, Texas (Location: 29 degrees 08'29.654 '' N, 094 degrees 44'51.339 '' W) to monitor coastal waters and provide data to investigate the processes controlling coastal Texas hypoxia. Hypoxia occurs in the Gulf of Mexico and refers to low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the bottom waters caused by a combination of environmental and physical parameters. Hypoxic events commonly occur along the Louisiana and Texas coasts however, little research has been conducted to investigate the processes responsible for Texas hypoxia formation. GIGEM was designed to help solve this problem by contributing real-time measurements to compare with historical coastal data series. Unlike traditional coastal OOS, GIGEM is installed on an experimental wind farm platform, operated by Wind Energy System Technologies Inc. (WEST). GIGEM is comprised of two components, the underwater mooring and bottom package, with all instrumentation connected by a unique, intricate design of seawater and surface inductive modems.

To achieve this aim, we present two assessments. First, we investigate the impacts of a North Sea power grid enabling enhanced trade and integration of offshore wind power. Second, we assess the benefit of the North Sea grid and wind power through a comparison of scenarios for power generation in affected countries.The grid scenario explored in the first assessment is the most ambitious scenario of the Windspeed project and is the result of cost minimization analysis using a transmission-expansion-planning model. We develop a hybrid life cycle inventory for array cables; high voltage, direct current (HVDC) links; and substations. The functional unit is 1 kWh of electricity transmitted. The second assessment compares two different energy scenarios of Windspeed for the North Sea and surrounding countries. Here, we utilize a life cycle inventory for offshore grid components together with an inventory for a catalog of power generation technologies from Ecoinvent and couple these inventories with grid configurations and electricity mixes determined by the optimization procedure in Windspeed.Developing, operating, and dismantling the grid cause emissions of 2.5 g CO2-Eq per kWh electricity transmission or 36 Mt CO2-Eq in total. HVDC cables are the major cause of environmental damage, causing, for example, half of total climate change effects. The next most important contributors are substations and array cabling used in offshore wind parks. Toxicity and eutrophication effects stem largely from leakages from disposed copper and iron mine tailings and overburden. Results from the comparison of two scenarios demonstrate a substantial environmental benefit from the North Sea grid extension and the associated wind power development compared with an alternative generation of electricity from fossil fuels. Offshore grid and wind power, however, entail an increased use of metals and, hence, a higher metal depletion indicator.We present the first life cycle assessment of a large offshore power grid, using the results of an energy planning model as input. HVDC links are the major cause of environmental damage. There are differences across impact categories with respect to which components or types of activities that are responsible for damage. The North Sea grid and wind power are environmentally beneficial by an array of criteria if displacing fossil fuels, but cause substantial metal use.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,6,0,34,,,0948-3349,1614-7502,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ind Ecol Programme, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwaySINTEF Energy Res, N-7465 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2014-05-08,WOS:000333204500010,,,,,

In the case of sea ducks along the U.S. Atlantic coast, managers want to estimate local and regional abundance to detect and track population declines, to define areas of high and low use, and to predict the impact of future habitat change on populations. In this paper, we used a modified marked point process to model survey data that recorded flock sizes of Common eiders, Long-tailed ducks, and Black, Surf, and White-winged scoters. The data come from an experimental aerial survey, conducted by the United States Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) Division of Migratory Bird Management, during which east-west transects were flown along the Atlantic Coast from Maine to Florida during the winters of 2009-2011. To model the number of flocks per transect (the points), we compared the fit of four statistical distributions (zero-inflated Poisson, zero-inflated geometric, zero-inflated negative binomial and negative binomial) to data on the number of species-specific sea duck flocks that were recorded for each transect flown. To model the flock sizes (the marks), we compared the fit of flock size data for each species to seven statistical distributions: positive Poisson, positive negative binomial, positive geometric, logarithmic, discretized lognormal, zeta and Yule-Simon. Akaike's Information Criterion and Vuong's closeness tests indicated that the negative binomial and discretized lognormal were the best distributions for all species for the points and marks, respectively. These findings have important implications for estimating sea duck-abundances as the discretized lognormal is a more skewed distribution than the Poisson and negative binomial, which are frequently used to model avian counts; the lognormal is also less heavy-tailed than the power law distributions (e.g., zeta and Yule-Simon), which are becoming increasingly popular for group size modeling. Choosing appropriate statistical distributions for modeling flock size data is fundamental to accurately estimating population summaries, determining required survey effort, and assessing and propagating uncertainty through decision-making processes.

Benzene, CO, SO2 and PM10 were always well below the AQS target values. However, NO2 frequently showed a pronounced gradient across the harbour reaching its highest concentrations at the city end, indicating that the road traffic was the principal source of the pollution. This was backed up by the predominance of aromatics in the VOCs in the city centre, derived from petrol engined vehicles, compared to the predominance of alkanes and alkenes around the docks, derived from diesel engined heavy trucks and possibly ships. Black carbon on the PM10 filters also showed a gradient with highest levels in the city centre. It is proposed that for such surveys in future, NO2 and black carbon would be the two most informative parameters.This emissions inventory has shown first, that trucks contribute very little to the total, and second, that the ro-ro ferries are the major contributors as they burn light fuel oil while the oil platform supply vessels burn low-sulphur marine gas oil with around 0.1% S. When the whole picture of the emissions from the city is considered, the emissions from the harbour constitute only a small part. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, paired data from a grid of nine passive acoustic click detectors (C-PODs, Chelonia Ltd., United Kingdom) and three days of simultaneous aerial line-transect visual surveys were collected over a 370 km(2) study area. The focus of the study was estimating the effective detection area of the passive acoustic sensors, which was defined as the product of the sound production rate of individual animals and the area within which those sounds are detected by the passive acoustic sensors. Visually estimated porpoise densities were used as informative priors in a Bayesian model to solve for the effective detection area for individual harbor porpoises. This model-based approach resulted in a posterior distribution of the effective detection area of individual harbor porpoises consistent with previously published values.

In the domain 100A degrees-145A degrees E and 0A degrees-35A degrees N, the model was forced by the cross-calibrated multi-platform (CCMP) wind fields of September 15 to October 5, 2011. We then validated the simulation results against wave radar data observed from an oil platform and altimeter data from the Jason-2 satellite. The simulated waves were characterized by five points along track using the Spectrum Integration Method (SIM) and the Spectrum Partitioning Method (SPM), by which wind sea and swell components of the 1D and 2D wave spectra are separated. There was reasonable agreement between the model results and observations, although the WW3 wave model may underestimate swell wave height. Significant wave heights are large along the typhoon track and are noticeably greater on the right of the track than on the left. Swells from the east are largely unable to enter the South China Sea because of the obstruction due to the Philippine Islands. During the initial stage and later period of the typhoon, swells at the five points were generated by the propagation of waves that were created by typhoons Haitang and Nalgae. Of the two methods, the 2D SPM method is more accurate than the 1D SIM which overestimates the separation frequency under low winds, but the SIM method is more convenient because it does not require wind speed and wave direction. When the typhoon left the area, the wind sea fractions decreased rapidly. Under similar wind conditions, the points located in the South China Sea are affected less than those points situated in the open sea because of the influence of the complex internal topography of the South China Sea. The results reveal the characteristic wind sea and swell features of the South China Sea and adjacent areas in response to typhoon Nesat, and provide a reference for swell forecasting and offshore structural designs.",,,,,,,,,6,3,0,0,2,0,8,,,0254-4059,1993-5005,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R ChinaState Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Petr, Coll Sci, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China",State Ocean Adm,,,2014-06-04,WOS:000335767800018,,,,,

Aspidella has been reinterpreted perhaps more than any other Precambrian taxon, and has variously been regarded as a fossil mollusc or 'medusoid', a gas escape structure, a concretion, or a mechanical suction mark. Our studies indicate that Aspidella includes a wide variety of preservational morphs varying from negative hyporeliefs with a raised rim and ridges radiating from a slit (Aspidella-type preservation), to flat discs with a central boss and sharp outer ring (Spriggia preservation), to positive hyporeliefs with concentric ornamentation (Ediacaria preservation). Specimens occur in a continuum of sizes, with preservational styles dependent on the size of the specimen and the grain size of the host lithology; the elongation of specimens is tectonic. Aspidella is confirmed as a body fossil from observations of complex radial and concentric ornamentation, mutually deformed borders in clusters of specimens, and occurrence on the same bedding planes as certain distinctive Ediacaran taxa. Aspidella is indistinguishable from, and has priority over, several of the most common genera of late Neoproterozoic discoidal body fossils worldwide. Similar fossils from Australia are interpreted as holdfasts of frond-like organisms. The density of specimens in the Aspidella beds suggests levels of benthic biomass in the Neoproterozoic that could rival those of modern marine communities. The serial growth forms, Palaeopascichnus, Intrites, Neonereites renarius and Yelovichnus, associated with Aspidella, are interpreted as body fossils of unknown affinities rather than trace fossils. A new, trilobed, Ediacaran body fossil, Triforillonia costellae gen. et sp. nov., is described from the Aspidella beds of the Fermeuse Formation.",,,,,,,,,209,10,4,0,107,0,242,,,0031-0239,,,,,,,,,,,"S Australian Museum, Div Nat Sci, Adelaide, SA 5000, AustraliaQueens Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",S Australian Museum,,,2000-07-01,WOS:000089659600002,,,,,

The total penguin population for the Falkland Islands has declined by 84% during the 1980s and 1990s. These declines did not occur in coastal South America, so potential causes of decline in the Falklands have been investigated. The suspected cause of decline is a reduction of fish and squid due to large-scale commercial fishing around the Falklands. Since 1995 rockhopper and gentoo populations have ceased declining, and appear to have reached a new equilibrium, albeit at a much lower level than before commercial fishing began. This has been matched by improved chick-rearing success and juvenile survival, however Magellanic penguins continue declining in the Falklands. Diet analysis shows that Magellanic penguins have a greater reliance on squid and fish species being taken commercially. In 1998 drilling for oil began around the Falklands, despite warnings that environmental protection was inadequate. Within a month the first of three separate oil spills occurred, killing and contaminating hundreds of penguins. The oil rig completed its drilling operations after five months and left the Falklands. Since then no further oil spills have occurred. Oil exploration is due to recommence in the near future, and environmental safeguards have not been improved. Ecotourism has increased rapidly over recent years in the Falklands, with penguins being the main attraction. Monitoring of the affects of tourism has concentrated on breeding success and population change, and the results indicate no detrimental affects on penguin populations at the current level. This paper investigates potential causes of penguin decline in the Falkland Islands, drawing comparison with populations in Chile which appear to be healthy. It concludes by calling on the Falkland Islands Government to exclude large-scale commercial fishing close to penguin breeding sites.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,20,4,24,,,0716-078X,0717-6317,,,,,,,,,,"Environm Res Unit, Stanley, Falkland Isl, Argentina",Environm Res Unit,,,2002-12-01,WOS:000180127200014,,,,,

The gravimetric and ground and aerial radar observations were made in these expeditions. About 300 glaciers of different morphological types and sizes with cold, subpolar and temperate thermal regime were studied.Basic results of these studies are the following: (1) the new data on the ice thicknesses, ice volumes, sub-glacial relief, internal structure, and thermal state of the glaciers were obtained; (2) the two-layered (polythermal) glaciers consisting of the upper layer of cold ice and the lower layer of temperate water-filled ice had been revealed in Svalbard for the first time; spatial distribution of cold, polythermal and temperate glaciers had been determined; (3) the evidences were obtained that measured changes in thickness of the upper cold ice layer in polythermal glaciers can be used to estimate the long-period variations of regional climates and serve as regional paleothermometers; (4) methods for estimating the water content in temperate and polythermal glaciers from the RES data were developed; and its space-time variations in temperate ices of the Svaldbald glaciers were estimated since even small water content inside of them can noticeably change their dynamic behavior; (5) methods for estimating the ice volume within glaciers in large regions of mountain and polar glaciations had been created; the ice storages were estimated in Svalbard, Franz Josef Land, Dzhungrsky Alatau, the Great Caucasus, and Mt. Elbrus; (6) detailed data on the ice thicknesses and the subglacial relief had been obtained for 40 glaciers in framework of different national and international programs and projects; the data can be used to solve a wide range of practical and theoretical problems, including numerical modeling.These studies demonstrated the following: (1) the use of monopulse radars VIRL-6 and VIRL-7 of decameter range (the central frequency is 20 MHz) with digital recording of the radar and GPS data is quite efficient for ground-based and airborne (from helicopters) radio-echo sounding of mountain and polar glaciers with their ice thicknesses up to 500-600 m; (2) it was found that thicknesses of glaciers in the Caucasus and Tien Shan can reach 330-430 m, while in regions of mountain, ice-sheet and transitional glaciation on the Spitsbergen Archipelago -300, 560 and 600 m, respectively, on the ice caps of the Franz-Josef Land and Severnaya Zemlya -450 and 813 m, and on King George and Livingston Islands (Sub-Antarctica) -330 and 500 m; (3) large parts of ice caps and outlet glaciers in Svalbard, Franz Josef Land, Severnaya Zemlya which beds were located below the sea level were found. Precisely these parts can be undergone quick shortening due to climate warming, and, thus, cause formation of icebergs making threats for ships and gas-oil marine platforms in the Barents and Kara seas; (4) data of the measurements made possible to calculate volumes of a number of investigated glaciers and ice caps and to estimate the ice storages in large areas of mountain and polar glaciations (the Jungar Alatau, Great Caucasus, Spitsbergen, Franz Josef Land); (5) decreasing of glacier volumes on the Franz Josef Land and some Spitsbergen glaciers for the last decades had been estimated.Analysis of the data obtained had shown that considerable part of polythermal glaciers in Spitsbergen belong to type of surging glaciers; they have the winter englacial runoff and form the near-glacier icings. It allows considering such glaciers as dynamically unstable, predisposed to surges as well as possible sources of winter water supply and additional sources of paleoinformation about long-period variations of regional climate.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,2076-6734,2412-3765,,,,,,,,,,"Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geog, Moscow, Russia",,,,2017-09-07,WOS:000408236300012,,,,,

Research on their dynamics is important for the well-being of coastal communities and their economies. Propagation of oil spills is a very complex physical-chemical process. As seen during the Deepwater Horizon event in the Gulf of Mexico during 2010, one of the critical problems remaining for prediction of oil transport and dispersion in the marine environment is the small-scale structure and dynamics of surface oil spills. The laboratory experiments conducted in this work were focused on understanding the differences between the dynamics of crude and weathered oil spills and the effect of dispersants. After deposition on the still water surface, a drop of crude oil quickly spread into a thin slick; while at the same time, a drop of machine (proxy for weathered) oil did not show significant evolution. Subsequent application of dispersant to the crude oil slick resulted in a quick contraction or fragmentation of the slick into narrow wedges and tiny drops. Notably, the slick of machine oil did not show significant change in size or topology after spraying dispersant. An advanced multi-phase, volume of fluid computational fluid dynamics model, incorporating capillary forces, was able to explain some of the features observed in the laboratory experiment. As a result of the laboratory and modeling experiments, the new interpretation of the effect of dispersant on the oil dispersion process including capillary effects has been proposed, which is expected to lead to improved oil spill models and response strategies.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,5,0,11,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Nova Southeastern Univ, Halmos Coll Nat Sci & Oceanog, Dania, FL USAUniv Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA",,,,2016-10-12,WOS:000383466500041,,,,,

Vermilion Snapper (139-535mm TL) were collected from May 2015 through October 2016 from artificial and natural reefs in the north-central GOM. Ages ranged from 0.8 to 13years, and there was no significant difference in growth between males and females. Nonlinear curve fitting was used to estimate growth parameters and Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to determine relative model fit. The two-parameter von Bertalanffy growth function provided the best model fit and lowest AIC score. Histological examination indicated that Vermilion Snapper are batch spawners with asynchronous oocyte development. Additionally, 17% of female Vermilion Snapper in the actively spawning subphase had 24-h postovulatory follicles (POF) suggesting daily spawning is occurring. No immature fish of either sex were collected during this study. Both histologically determined phases and gonadosomatic index patterns defined a spawning season occurring from April through September. The spawning interval for Vermilion Snapper, 1.3 and 2.1d, was estimated using the hydrated oocyte and POF methods, respectively. Batch fecundity estimates from 5,497 to 284,468 eggs per batch were determined using fish macroscopically classified as actively spawning (n=25), and total annual fecundity was estimated to range from 450,754 to 32,549,776 eggs per spawning season. Mean relative batch fecundity was 70.7eggs/g of gonad-free body weight.

Over the pack-ice, the concentrations are typically lower and the vertical structure changes as the air is advected northward. Modelled DMS(g) maxima above the local boundary layer were present in about 3% of the profiles found over the pack-ice. These maxima were found in association to frontal zones. Our results also show that DMS(g) can be mixed downward by turbulence into the local boundary layer and act as a local near-surface DIMS(g) source over the pack-ice and may hence influence the growth of cloud condensation nuclei and cloud formation in the boundary layer.

To address this knowledge gap, adult Yelkouan Shearwaters at a breeding colony in Malta were fitted with geolocators in 2 consecutive years. Of the 13 birds tracked (two of which were tracked in both years), the majority (n = 10; 76.9 %) migrated in June-July to spend most of the non-breeding period in the Black Sea (n = 5), Aegean Sea (n = 2), Black and Aegean seas (n = 2), or Black and Adriatic seas (n = 1). The final three birds remained within the central Mediterranean area and did not move beyond 500 km of the breeding colony. There was considerable variation among individuals in terms of timing of the outward and return migrations, duration and location of periods of residency in different areas, and migration routes. However, migration patterns (including routes and areas visited) were very consistent in the two individuals tracked in consecutive years. All birds returned in November or December to waters closer to the breeding colony, concentrating between the North African coast and the southern Adriatic. This study has identified key areas during the non-breeding season for Yelkouan Shearwaters from Malta which are also likely to be important for other populations. Given the continuing decline of this species throughout its range, this information represents an essential step for improving international conservation efforts. At-sea threats in the wintering regions include by-catch in long-line and trawl fisheries, impacts of over-fishing, illegal hunting (particularly in Maltese waters), ingestion of plastics, pollution, and the potential impact of off-shore wind farms.

J,,,,,,,,,Boyd McKew,,Quantifying a marine ecosystem's response to a catastrophic oil spill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Dec 01 2017,2017,"Over 1.3 million tonnes of oil enters the sea each year from sources including oil rigs and tanker spills. Europe is particularly vulnerable to oil spills, as over half of the 20 biggest oil-shipping disasters have occurred there, including three in the UK. Recently on the 10th September the Agia Zoni oil tanker sank in the Saronic Gulf (near Athens, Greece) releasing over 2500 tonnes of fuel oil and marine gas into the marine environment. Such oil spills have severe impacts on the local marine life, tourism and fishing industry, as oil contains many different toxic hydrocarbons that can cause mass mortalities of birds, mammals, fish and shellfish. Fortunately there are some types of bacteria that can degrade hydrocarbons to naturally clean up the marine environment. Usually these specialist bacteria grow to very large numbers after an oil spill. However, it takes many different species of bacteria working together to degrade the hundreds of different types of hydrocarbons that are present in oil, and we still know very little about how these microbial consortia develop over time during an oil spill and subsequent clean-up operations. Oil spills can also have an impact on important microbially driven processes, such as the cycling of nitrogen. In marine environments, microorganisms convert nitrogen to different chemical forms (e.g. from ammonia to nitrite and then nitrate in a process known as nitrification), which can then be removed from the ecosystem as dinitrogen gas by denitrification. Too much nitrogen in the form of ammonia or nitrate could cause severe pollution problems, resulting in increased growth of algae, potentially triggering harmful and toxic algal blooms. Microorganisms involved in the N-cycle therefore perform vital ecosystem services, but presently we have very little understanding of how the nitrogen cycle is affected by large oil spills. In this study we will investigate some of these important research areas. Firstly, we will monitor the effects of the oil spill and subsequent clean-up operation over a 10-month period. We will determine which microorganisms (Bacteria, Archaea, Fungi and microalgae) are affected by the oil in either a positive way (e.g. increase in abundance of oil-degrading microbes) or negative way (e.g. direct toxicity of oil or being out-competed by oil-degrading microbes). This will be achieved by extracting DNA from oil-contaminated sediments and water followed by sequencing and quantifying taxonomic marker genes. At the same timepoints, we will measure changes in hydrocarbon composition and concentration. This will allow us to determine changes in the specialist hydrocarbon-degrading microbial communities in relation to hydrocarbon availability, and improve our understanding of the indigenous microbial community to remove the oil.We will also perform a focused analysis on N-cycling microorganisms (both nitrifying and denitrifying organisms) to determine how their abundances are affected in response to the oil spill. This will determine whether they may be any overall negative effects on the important ecosystem service that they perform.Finally our research will quantify the effect of the oil spill on the wider marine food web by recording effects on marine animals, including invertebrates such as shellfish, as well as fish and marine mammals, to establish which species are affected by oil spills and how well their populations recover from the spill over time.Since opportunities to study large oil spills in situ are rare, it is important for us to understand the effects of an oil spill in natural settings to enable the design of better oil remediation and management strategies for future spills and limit the damage they cause to coastal environments and marine life.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/R016569/1,,,,,,,,University of Essex,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15355743,,,,,

This paper presents the data obtained from a number of drained monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests on crushable carbonate sand (Ballyconnelly sand) in conjunction with small-strain shear stiffness (G(max)) measurements using the bender element technique. The soils were allowed to shear under three different loading patterns to understand the factors influencing the breakage of particles. The degree of crushing was quantified and analysed based on the total energy input. It was observed that, apart from applied stress, the total strain accumulation governs the amount of particle breakage. It was observed that G(max ) increased significantly under high stress ratio.

Between 2004 and the installation of a containment system in 2019 MC20 became an in situ laboratory for a wide range of hydrocarbon in the sea-related research, including different methods of assessing the volumetric flow rate of hydrocarbons spanning different temporal scales. In 2017 a shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and high-frequency (90 to 154kHz) broadband echosounder were deployed to assess the flow rate of liquid and gas phase hydrocarbons. Measurements of horizontal currents were combined with acoustic mapping to determine the rise velocity of the seep as it moved downstream. Models of the rise velocity for fluid particles were used to predict the size of oil droplets and gas bubbles in the seep. The amplitude and shape of the broadband acoustic backscatter were then used to differentiate between, and determine the flow rate of, hydrocarbons. Oil flow rate in the seep was estimated to be 56 to 86 barrels/day (mean =71barrels/day) while the flow rate of gaseous hydrocarbons was estimated to be 98 to 359m(3)/day (mean =229m(3)/day).Plain Language Summary The Mississippi Canyon block 20 (MC20) oil spill was the result of the toppling of an oil production platform during Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Oil was released from the seafloor where it rose to the surface for 15years, until a containment system was installed over the leak in 2019. The spill area became a natural laboratory for studying oil released from the seafloor. A variety of measurements over different lengths of time were used to estimate the oil flow rate at MC20 including satellites, shipboard sonars, and sensors on underwater vehicles. We present results from a shipboard sonar method which measured a flow rate of 56 to 86 barrels per day. The value and range of the flow rate varied between the methods used at MC20. This difference could be due to differences among the length of time of measurements, for example, the shipboard sonar measurements were made over 4.5hr while the containment system measure for about 30days, or the difference could be due to differences in how the measurements are made. More research is needed to determine how the flow rate of oil rising from the seafloor varies over time to understand how flow rate measurements should be interpreted.Key PointsA shipboard broadband acoustic survey was performed at the site of a seafloor-sourced oil spill to determine the flow rate of hydrocarbons The rise rate and amplitude and shape of broadband backscatter determined the size, number, and identity (oil or gas) of targets The flow rate of liquid hydrocarbons was estimated to be between 56 and 86 barrels per day",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,0,5,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New Hampshire, Dept Earth Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USAWoods Hole Oceanog Inst, Appl Ocean Phys & Engn, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USAUniv New Hampshire, Dept Mech Engn, Durham, NH 03824 USA",,,,2021-02-15,WOS:000612077200056,,,,,

Attack on the Ferrier cation provides a new acetal linkage concurrent with the transposition of the alkene moiety. The idiosyncratic outcomes of Ferrier reactions of seven-membered ring carbohydrate-based oxepines prompted an investigation of its corresponding septanosyl Ferrier cation. Experiments that characterized the ion, including gas-phase cryogenic IR spectroscopy matched with density functional theory-calculated spectra of candidate cation structures, as well as product analysis from solution-phase Ferrier reactions, are reported here. Results from both approaches revealed an inclination of the seven-membered ring cation to contract to five-membered ring structures. Gas-phase IR spectra matched best to calculated spectra of structures in which five-membered dioxolenium formation opened the oxepine ring. In the solution phase, an attack on the ion by water led to an acyclic enal that cyclized to a C-methylene-aldehydo arabinofuranoside species. Attack by allyl trimethylsilane, on the other hand, was diastereoselective and yielded a C-allyl septanoside.

The SAR wind maps are area-averaged by a simple footprint method assuming neutral stability and with three nonlinear weighting footprint methods including correction for stability. From a physical point of view, the latter is more correct. However, between in situ and SAR-derived wind-speed estimates comparison results of the nonlinear footprint values are statistically less correlated (R-2 = 0.73 - 0.77) and the standard error (SE) is larger (>1.5 m s(-1)) than results from the simple footprint (R-2 = 0.78 - 0.80 and SE = 1.3 ms(-1)).

Several European countries, on their own initiative or driven by the European Union's Marine Strategy and Maritime Policy, the Bergen Declaration of the North Sea Conference, and the EU Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management, have taken global leadership in implementing marine spatial planning. Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany in the North Sea, and the United Kingdom in the Irish Sea, have already completed preliminary sea use plans and zoning proposals for marine areas within their national jurisdictions. This paper discusses the nature and context of marine spatial planning, the international legal and policy framework, and the increasing need for marine spatial planning in Europe. In addition, the authors review briefly three marine spatial planning initiatives in the North Sea and conclude with some initial lessons learned from these experiences. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Generally, effects were limited to within 1 km from the platform, but two platforms historically drilled with oil-based mud were impacted up to 1.2 km away. Impacts persisted for at least 6-8 years in the northern and central North Sea, but were undetectable in the south where cuttings piles do not accumulate.

Changing marine utilization patterns represent a considerable challenge to society and governments. Maritime spatial planning has emerged as one tool to manage conflicts between users and achieve societal goals for the use of marine space; however, single-sector management approaches are too often still the norm. The last decades have seen the rise of a new ocean use concept: the joint multi-use of ocean space. This paper aims to explain and refine the concept of ocean multi-use of space by reviewing the development and state of the art of multi-use in Europe and presenting a clear definition and a comprehensive typology for existing multi-use combinations. It builds on the connectivity of uses and users in spatial, temporal, provisional, and functional dimensions as the underlying key characteristic of multi-use dimensions. Combinations of these dimensions yield four distinct types of multi-use with little overlap between them. The diversity of types demonstrates that there is no one-size-fits-all management approach, but rather that adaptive management plans are needed, focusing on achieving the highest societal benefit while minimizing conflicts. This work will help to sharpen, refine and advance the public and academic discourse over marine spatial planning by offering a common framework to planners, researchers and users alike, when discussing multi-use and its management implications.",,,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,16,0,52,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Bremerhaven, GermanyUniv Dundee, Sch Social Sci, Dundee, ScotlandThetis SpA, Venice, ItalyCNR Natl Res Council Italy, ISMAR Inst Marine Sci, Venice, ItalyMarine Scotland Sci, Aberdeen, ScotlandInst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Athens, GreeceSUBMARINER Network Blue Growth EEIG, Berlin, GermanyBremerhaven Univ Appl Sci, Fac Appl Marine Biol & Aquaculture 1, Bremerhaven, Germany",Thetis SpASUBMARINER Network Blue Growth EEIGBremerhaven Univ Appl Sci,,,2019-04-02,WOS:000463166300001,,,,,

Additional simulations revealed that vertical migration behaviour was essential to larval survival through its impact on advection. The six years simulated include two of high, two of low, and two of average puerulus settlement. The most robust interannual difference of the simulations was that, when coastal sea level was low and the Leeuwin Current was weak, more early-stage larvae were lost to the north and west under the influence of the wind. Conversely, many late-stage model larvae were carried south of the fishery in years when the Leeuwin Current was strong. The fraction of model larvae remaining or arriving offshore of the fishery and metamorphosing was essentially constant from year to year, so the variation in observed puerulus settlement was not explained by the model.

This excavation can be done through suction dredging resulting in a pit. Different slope angles of this pit can be realized using this technique. As the failure mechanisms of artificial submarine slopes using suction dredging are barely investigated, relatively small final slope angles of max. 10 degree are reached to guarantee stability. Nevertheless, small-scale experiments show that submarine slopes with overcritical slope inclinations can be stable for a while when prepared with suction dredging. Steeper inclinations would significantly reduce the disturbance of the marine fauna and the amount of sand to be removed and therefore meet both economic and ecological interests. The investigations of the failure mechanism in the submarine slope during suction dredging are carried out with a coupled Euler-Lagrange approach, namely the combination of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the Discrete Element Method (DEM). This method enables the computation of particle -particle as well as the fluid-particle interaction forces and hence their influence on the investigated submarine slope behavior. The calculations are carried out with the open source software package CFDEM coupling, which combines the discrete element code LIGGGHTS with CFD solvers based on OpenFOAM. Additionally, small scale model tests of suction dredging of sandy submarine slopes are carried out. The displacement of the soil grains is monitored with a high-speed camera. To take into account effects of contractancy and dilatancy, a loosely and a densely packed sand are investigated and the influence of the packing density on the failure mechanism is evaluated. The experimentally gained results will be compared to the numerical ones to evaluate the capability of the coupled CFD-DEM method to depict the failure behavior of submarine slopes during suction dredging.",,,,,"38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)","JUN 09-14, 2019JUN 09-14, 2019","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine EngnASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn","Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLANDUniv Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLAND",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,2153-4772,,978-0-7918-5876-9,,,,,,,,,"Hamburg Univ Technol, Inst Geotech Engn & Construct Management, D-21079 Hamburg, Germany",,,,2020-02-28,WOS:000513068400083,,,,,

Carbon-isotopic variations have been linked to changes in ocean structure, productivity and concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In the Middle-Upper Jurassic Terminilletto section of the Umbria-Marche-Sabina Apennines (central Italy), well preserved radiolarians are present in a sequence of cherty limestones interbedded with platform-derived carbonates. The delta(13)C curve in the Aalenian-Kimmeridgian interval indicates three main positive delta(13)C 'events' in the lower Bajocian, late Bathonian-lower Callovian and middle Oxfordian. The positive delta(13)C shifts are correlated to increases in visible chert in the outcrop and may represent periods of increased biological productivity of surface sea-water. Spumellaria/Nassellaria ratios and the fluctuations of relative abundance of selected genera tend to correlate with delta(13)C and chert abundance values, and seem to be related to episodes of high nutrient mobilisation. From the base of the Bajocian, the radiolarian associations show a slight tendency towards diversification, coincident with increasing delta(13)C values. In the upper part of the middle Bajocian, last appearances prevail over first appearances associated with the peak of the delta(13)C event. This may indicate maximum eutrophic conditions. Coincident with the late Bathonian-early Callovian positive delta(13)C shift, the radiolarian associations record a different trend with respect to the Bajocian event. When the delta(13)C values are increasing to a maximum, radiolarian associations tend to be reduced in species diversity, followed by a small diversification trend when the delta(13)C values are decreasing. We speculate that during the Callovian a more 'stressful' palaeoenvironment, due to high level of eutrophication, is indicated by the combination of high productivity of biogenic silica and low carbonate input. Although varying preservational conditions may have influenced the observed trends in the radiolarian associations, the good correlation between changes of sedimentation patterns, radiolarian assemblages and delta(13)C positive anomalies, open interesting avenues for further investigations concerning the palaeoecology of Mesozoic radiolarians.

However, offshore turbines differ from the onshore turbines essentially only in towers and foundations. So the well-known drawbacks and limitations of propellers still remain offshore. We note the limited unit power capacity, infrasound emission, and harmful effects on birds and animals. The following tasks were set: to increase substantially unit capacity of wind power plants, to work safely under extra wind loads, to enhance wind speed range, to reduce wind energy cost, to eliminate infra sound emission and fatal injury of birds due to turbine rotation. They can be reached with the recently suggested concept of wind turbines called Wind Energy Marine Unit (WEMU). All WEMU turbines feature large-scale (more than 100m in diameter) circular floating rotors. A circular pontoon bears vertical columns with a circular deck and rotary blades. In this way, water supports the rotor during slow rotation about vertical axis. Here we present approaches, methods, and important results of aerodynamic research of the WEMU turbines.Well-verified CFD-methods with full-scale domains are chosen for research. Flow through the turbine is described by RANS equations with chosen turbulent models. Numerical aerodynamic experiments are carried out using the finite volume method with several geometrical models of the rotor. Discretization, grid, and calculation conditions are described. As a rule, the computation domain is presented by a non-conformal grid of hexahedral elements and is divided into rotary and stationary zones. The vertical wind profile on the velocity-inlet boundary at height above 10 m is described according to the Monin-Obukhov theory with parameters which are typical to sea surface. At first, several symmetric airfoils are analyzed. Slightly convex airfoil with two flaps is found out as optimal for rotary blades. Maximum of power capacity is achieved for nondimensional blade speed as 0.7 similar to 0.8. Aerodynamic efficiency of the WEMU turbine about 50% is guaranteed by an optimal control of rotation of vertical blades. Vertical circulation in cross-flow turbines is described. Stiffened design of the turbine with two face rings is proposed and investigated. It is shown that a slope of the plane of the floating turbine's rotation cannot change the air flow significantly. Additionally, new design of cross-flow turbine with partially free rotating blades is investigated. Turbine's parameters are found out which provide positive torque for most blade positions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-60741-091-1,,,,,,,,,"Far Eastern State Tech Univ, Vladivostok, Russia",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000276037800012,,,,,

For harbor porpoises high nocturnal echolocation activity was demonstrated near industrial structures and it was hypothesized that this was caused by increased feeding opportunities at night. Here we tested the hypothesis that bridge pillars will lead to more nocturnal echolocation activity by porpoises near them than at positions further away. The daily rhythms in porpoise detections near bridge pillars tended to be slightly more pronounced and a greater proportion of clicks occurred during the night. However, water depth had a greater impact on these rhythms, with more nocturnal porpoise echolocation activity and more pronounced daily rhythms in deeper waters. This may be related to different feeding techniques and prey choice by porpoises in deep and shallow water. In deeper water porpoises may be feeding pelagically on herring and cod, which show more activity and are easier to catch at night. In shallow water they may be targeting mainly gobies using a bottom feeding technique and this may not be more efficient at night.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,19,0,19,,,0824-0469,1748-7692,,,,,,,,,,"BioConsult SH, D-25813 Husum, Germany",BioConsult SH,,,2014-08-15,WOS:000339101800014,,,,,

This makes it an interesting alternative to usual offshore foundations with driven piles instead of buckets. However, the installation process must be accurately calculated and controlled to avoid hydraulic failure, buckling and inadmissible rotations. Moreover, open questions regarding the bearing behavior of bucket foundations particularly under transient or cyclic loads exist.

The turbine meter coefficient is referred to as the 'K factor', and is defined as the number of pulses per unit volume. At present, there is no single mathematical equation to predict the actual K factor. More accurate estimations and trending of the K factor will not only facilitate preventive maintenance, replacement analysis, etc., but will also ensure that material Bow accounting is accurate.This research explores the use of neural-network models to aid in the estimation of the actual K factor that reflects the effect of the actual operating conditions of the turbine meter. This research analyzed data from three different turbine Bow meters measuring the rate of pumping oil from the North Sea, for a company that operates off-shore oil platforms. The use of neural networks presents a new approach to the capturing of the underlying nonlinear relationships among the various input variables and the K factor. The results from this study report significant percentage reductions in mean absolute errors for the neural-network predictions over the company's present estimation practices for the turbine Bow-meter coefficient.

He was kept at water and air temperatures similar to those experienced by wild conspecifics. At the age of 3 y and 10 mo, the porpoise's body length stabilized at 148 cm. Body mass, an indicator of body condition, increased to similar to 40 kg between the ages of 2 and 5.5 y, after which it fluctuated seasonally by 5 to 10 kg. The porpoise's food consumption was similar to 1,200 to similar to 4,400 g/d but was generally similar to 2,400 g/d (nearly 7% of body mass). Based on the caloric content of the fish diet, his energy intake was 9,000 to 26,000 kJ/d; the average was similar to 18,000 kJ/d. Once his body length had stabilized, the, porpoise's daily mean respiration rate was 17 to 26 breaths per 5 min (3 to 5 breaths/min). Correlation analysis revealed that respiration rate and body mass declined with increasing water temperature and that respiration rate increased with increasing food consumption. When the porpoise's body length was stable, his food consumption also decreased as the water temperature increased. If the data from the present study are representative of other male harbor porpoises, these results indicate that male harbor porpoises may need different amounts of food depending on the season and on whether they are growing or adult. Food consumption peaks in winter; thus, seasonality should be taken into account in energetics studies. Depending on food availability at sea, harbor porpoises may be more or less vulnerable to disturbances that decrease their foraging efficiency. With information from this longitudinal study, experts will be better informed on typical body condition patterns when considedng the Interim Population Consequences of Disturbance (iPCoD) model.

Biogenic structures increased low tide carbon gas emissions at contaminated (30%) and particularly pristine conditions (60%).

The sampling and measuring methods followed the Specifications for Oceanographic Surveys and Specifications for Marine Monitoring. A total of 87 phytoplankton species were found, including 72 species of diatom in 33 genera and 15 species of pyrrophyta in 9 genera. There was another species of chrysophyta in 1 genus. Diatoms were the dominant phytoplankton species, while some dinoflagellates species also accounted for a large portion in the community. Compared to the historical data in the same season, there was an obvious shift in the community structure. Eucampia zodiacus, a previous dominant species, were not found in this survey; however, Thalassiosira punctigera appeared for the first time as a dominant species. The dominance of planktonic dinoflagellate became increasingly evident.

The main features of oil spreading and dynamics in an ice pack are taken into account in the model which is used for the simulation of possible spills in the Southern Ocean: in the short term in cold waters and in the presence of ice, and in the long term. The results show that the presence of ice completely modifies the classical spreading of an oil slick by shrinking its area, and by incorporating some oil in the ice structures. The quantity of oil initially entrapped in the ice may later induce a second spill. The divergent nature of the Antarctic ice strongly influences the oil evolution. The remaining oil is lead in the circumpolar current by the ice pack and is ejected eastwards. Information that can be drawn from the model is exemplified by case studies of oil spilling in the Southern Ocean and possible further applications are discussed.

We identified 96 historical records from 10 localities where Red Knots were detected at least once in the period 1951-2008. The number of birds per record ranged from 1 to >2,000, but most observations (ca. 80%) ranged from a few to 100 birds. The sites with more records of Red Knots and the highest counts were relatively flat sandy beaches of the dissipative morphodynamic type, which have a higher abundance of potential prey for Red Knots (especially Wedge Clams Donax hanleyanus), for instance Barra del Chuy beach, near the Brazilian border.Most historical observations occurred during northward migration in late austral summer and fall. The maximum count at Barra del Chuy was 1,191 birds in April 2010. However, very few birds were recorded in 2011. Median minimum length of stay of individually color-marked birds that were seen on at least two days was estimated as 5 days (range: 2-26 days). Several individual birds were observed on both sides of the Brazil-Uruguay border, suggesting that Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) and Barra del Chuy (Uruguay) should be treated as a single staging area. Resightings of Red Knots banded at Rio Grande (Tierra del Fuego non-breeding site) and San Antonio Oeste (a Patagonian stopover area) in Barra del Chuy, suggest that Rio Grande do Sul-Barra del Chuy and San Antonio Oeste function as independent moulting and fuelling areas for Red Knots en route north from Tierra del Fuego. Potential threats to the species in Uruguay are related to artificial freshwater discharge from rice fields negatively affecting Wedge Clams and other macrofauna, harmful algal blooms, and possible wind turbine establishment close to the coastline. Mass-mortality events were not recorded during the study period, and the cause of the mortality event that occurred in 2007 could not be determined.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,2058-8410,2058-8410,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Republica, Ctr Univ Reg Este, Dept Agr Syst and Cultural Landscapes, Biodivers Environm and Soc Grp, Montevideo, Uruguay",,,,2016-02-12,BCI:BCI201600197998,,,,,

The 26 coral atolls forming the archipelago are composed of sand and coral with a maximum height of about 2.30 m above the mean sea level. Periodic flooding from storm surges and the frequent freshwater scarcity are perceived by the population and the economic operators as the major environmental stresses. Moreover, the strong dependence on imported fossil fuels increases, even more, the environmental concerns. Diesel, in fact, still represents the main source of power generation, typically through privately managed small diesel sets. The real challenge for this area is to promote the environmental quality with socioeconomic growth. The present study aims to evaluate the strategic effectiveness to face these issues by wave and offshore wind energy. Resources using a 10-year hindcast dataset are here examined. The annual offshore wave power was found to range between 8.46 kW/m and 12.75 kW/m, while the 10 m and 100 m mean wind power density is respectively 0.08 kW/m(2) and 0.16 kW/m(2). Based on these results, an environmentally and socio-economically sustainable best-case scenario is constructed and two atoll islands (Male and Magoodhoo) are specifically investigated.

We analyzed the effect of WPPs on movement patterns of sea eagles in Germany with satellite telemetry. We analyzed ranging behavior and environmental parameters that influence the behavioral flight response to WPPs using multiple regression models. During 2003 through 2009 we radio-tracked 25 white-tailed sea eagles in northern Germany (8 territorial, 7 non-territorial, 10 young eagles marked as nestlings). Mean home range sizes of territorial eagles varied with individuals tracked and the estimation method applied, ranging from 2.7km(2) to 669.7km(2). Sex or breeding status did not influence home range size. Ranging behavior varied between individuals and was correlated with habitat quality (i.e., nest distance to nearest water source and to anthropgogenic structure) and weather conditions. Among the 9 territorial eagles, only 1 individual resided within the officially proposed 3-km minimum safety distance between nest and planned WPP. However, others frequently moved >3km away from their nests, leaving the proposed safety area. One eagle inhabiting a territory within intensively cultivated landscape frequently approached a WPP and did not alter its movement patterns near the WPP compared to control areas. We identified several features visited by the eagles (e.g., perches, small lakes). To mitigate the collision risk of eagles, the recommended safety radius of 3km between nest and WPP should become an international standard with a safe flight corridor to feeding grounds. To avoid frequent collisions at the population scale with WPPs, it is important to construct WPPs only outside the main distribution areas of white-tailed sea eagles.

We used marine radar to study murrelets year-round during the peak dawn activity period (n = 78 mornings) at three high-use sites in northern California. Murrelet passage rates were relatively low in winter (11%-47% of summer rates), increased in spring, peaked during the summer breeding period (late April-July) and were lowest during the fall molt period. We observed large among-site differences in mean flight altitudes of murrelets between two sites along the coast (93 +/- 3 m and 98 +/- 3 m above ground level [agl]) and a single site further inland (257 +/- 6 m agl). Flight altitudes during periods with fog or scattered rain did not differ significantly from altitudes during periods without precipitation.

Vent gas from gas hydrate shows no meaningful molecular evidence of gas hydrate decomposition. Gas hydrate fabrics, mainly vein fillings, are typical of ongoing crystallization. Once crystallized, most hydrocarbons are protected from bacteria within the crystal lattice of gas hydrate.

A review of bird distribution, protection regimes and potential sources of anthropogenic disturbance. A report of the Wadden Sea Plan Project 34.",,,,,,,,Wadden Sea Ecosystem,,,,16,,,,1,120,,,,,,,,,,,Article,2003,2003,"The Wadden Sea ranks among the most important wetlands to migratory waterbirds in the world. Its vast area of intertidal mudflats hosts numerous bird species breeding in the tundra from arctic Canada in the west to northern Siberia in the east. They use the Wadden Sea either as a stop-over site between the arctic breeding areas and the wintering areas in Africa, or stay in the area to winter. Besides, some species gather to moult in late summer. Most birds staying in the Wadden Sea, feed during low tide at intertidal mudflats and congregate in large flocks at communal high tide roosts. Often, these roosts are found at the edges of salt marshes, on sand flats and beaches or, when foreland is lacking, also at dikes and breakwaters in harbours. Some species also roost at inland pastures and arable fields or in wetlands behind the seawall. The attendance of high tide roosts is highly dynamic and depends, e.g., on actual water tables, distance to the nearest feeding areas, the degree of human disturbance and species-specific behaviour. The safe-guarding of high tide roosts is one of the most important tools for the conservation and protection of birds in the Wadden Sea and can be achieved by the targets set in the Wadden Sea Plan. As part of the Wadden Sea Plan and the Stade Declaration of 1997, a special project was launched to investigate the current status of high tide roosts in the Wadden Sea and to present a review of available knowledge of the distribution of waterbirds at high tide roosts, including knowledge concerning the necessity for undisturbed roosting sites. This report presents a detailed over-view of distribution of waterbirds in the Wadden Sea during high tide and an inventory of protection regimes and potential sources of anthropogenic disturbance for each site. For this purpose, data from mainly trilateral co-ordinated water-bird counts from the Joint Monitoring of Migratory Birds (JMMB), which are carried out in the framework of the Trilateral Monitoring and Assessment Program (TMAP), between 1990 - 2000 were analysed for species which show tidal movements and depend on high tide roosts. These counts are mainly carried out in the Wadden Sea Cooperation Area, but additionally also include agricultural sites behind the seawall (mainly in Denmark, Lower Saxony and the Netherlands), which belong to the network of roosting sites as well and are especially important during exceptional high tides or for specific terrestrial species like Brent Goose, Golden Plover and Curlew. Data on site characteristics and potential sources of anthropogenic disturbance were derived from available trilateral data (Quality Status Report) and expert estimates on the level of human activities. Special caution was taken to provide a similar approach in estimating these levels in Denmark, Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony and the Netherlands. Roosting behaviour in migratory waterbirds is a complex phenomenon. Gathering in large and dense flocks is thought to minimise the risk of predation for individuals by e.g. Peregrine Falcons, but also saves energy when staying close together at the roost. In a dynamic area like the Wadden Sea, actual water tables, distance to the nearest favourable feeding areas, preferred roosting habitat, site-tenacity and social status of the birds all contribute to the actual number of birds and species observed at a high tide roost. As a result, species often use a network of roosting sites. For a species like Red Knot this network might cover an area of 800 km2 within a short run of tidal cycles. Apart from these natural factors, the level of anthropogenic disturbance is one of the most important factors determining numbers observed at high tide roosts and puts an extra constraint on the birds' narrow energetic balance and tight time schedule for migration. Case studies in several parts of the Wadden Sea, point out that recreational activities are the most observed sources of disturbance. This is supported by our inventory, which points out that 80% of all roosting sites in the Wadden Sea is subject to some kind of recreational pressure (36% of the roosting sites when considering only moderate to heavy recreational pressure). Moreover, data on phenology show that the seasonal occurrence of some species is affected by moderate and heavy recreation pressure, i.e. birds tend to avoid roosts visited by many people in the summer holiday season. Hunting is observed at many sites as well (up to 33% of all sites in Denmark, when regarding moderate to heavy hunting pressure). Although hunting on migratory waterbirds has been gradually phased out in the Wadden Sea during the 1990s, hunting on small mammals like Hare is still common practise and also occurs at salt marshes, close to high tide roosts. Other sources of potential anthropogenic disturbance, like civil air traffic, military training activities and wind farms occur at a much smaller scale, although sometimes close to important high tide roosts (e.g. Vliehorsat Vlieland, the Netherlands, which is situated in a military shooting range). In general, it turns out that the largest roosting sites are a result of large intertidal mudflats at close range and low levels (or absence) of human disturbance. This combination is especially found at remote and uninhabited islands, like Suderoogsand, Trischen (both Schleswig-Holstein), Scharhorn (Hamburg), Memmert (Lower Saxony), Griend and Richel (both Netherlands). The outstanding importance of the Wadden Sea has been acknowledged in several international conventions and directives, such as the Ramsar Convention, the Bonn Convention on Migratory Species and the EC Bird and Habitat Directives. These all have been implemented in the national legislation and the respective protection regimes. When regarding Special Protection Sites of the EC Bird Directive and Ramsar sites, which overlap with most of the national protection regimes, most countries have more than 80% of their high tide roosts located within designated areas (for most species also supporting more than 90% of the birds observed). In the Netherlands and Lower Saxony, this figure is somewhat lower since both countries have a large proportion of inland agricultural areas among their roosting sites, which are subject to limited special protection measures. Only in Lower Saxony, important inland sites outside the trilateral cooperation area have been included in SPA boundaries, whereas in the Netherlands these areas were not taken into account in the last update of SPAs in 2000. Especially species like Brent Goose, Golden Plover and Curlew are known to frequent inland roosts in large numbers. More-over, inland roosting sites become important for all species during very high water tables, when regular high tide roosts become flooded. In Lower Saxony, Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, nation-al protection regimes have been set up by establishing national parks, which include zoning for different human activities. In Denmark and the Netherlands, a similar approach was followed with the introduction of the Nature and Wildlife Re-serve and the Key Planning Decision Wadden Sea respectively. However, the actual size of the highest protection zone in these countries is smaller than in Germany. Besides, zoning of recreational activities has not been developed here in detail. The guiding principle of the trilateral Wadden Sea policy is to achieve, as far as possible, a natural and sustainable ecosystem in which natural processes proceed in an undisturbed way (Minis-trial Declaration Esbjerg 1991). Three of the four targets on birds, which were agreed upon at the Leeuwarden Conference in 1994, are related to the impact of human disturbance. This report shows that, despite extensive protection regimes, disturbance of roosting birds occurs in all parts of the Wadden Sea. Especially outdoor recreation occurs around many roosting sites and its volume, along with conflicts between tourism and nature conservation, is expected to increase in future (Quality Status Report, 1999). Moreover, recreational activities more and more expand to spring and autumn (although still peak during summer holidays in July and August). As a result, potential conflicts between waterbirds at-tending high tide roosts and recreational activities around these roosts are especially to be expected in May and in July-October. Both are critical periods to birds as they involve pre-migration and pre-breeding fattening and moulting in late summer. In order to reduce this conflict, a spatial and temporal zoning of recreational activities as well as a convincing visitor information system should be further developed. Besides, more information is needed concerning natural flight distances, which can give feed-back in planning public access to areas in the vicinity of roosting sites. For this purpose, also care-fully designed experiments should be set up in order to assess the complex relationships between bird numbers and the level of recreational activities. Also it is important to include management of non-waterbird hunting in trilateral protection measures, especially to reduce impact from hunting in salt marshes or inland roosting sites during high tide. Furthermore, the impact of civil air traffic (including ultra-light aircraft), military training activities and wind farms should be assessed in more detail. Civil air traffic has been largely regulated by trilateral standards now, but severe disturbance is still reported from a number of roosting sites. Military training activities occur only at a few sites, but one of these (Vliehors at VIieland) is one of the most important high tide roosts in the entire Wadden Sea. Establishing wind farms in the Wadden Sea Conservation Area is forbidden now, but conflicts for roosting birds might arise when planning wind farms in inland areas close to the seawall or in offshore areas close to the Wadden Sea. A more careful selection of sites as well as more detailed studies concerning the impact of wind farms for other species than geese is necessary to reduce possible conflicts here. This can also be achieved by a better formal protection of inland roosting sites, which is lacking especially in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,0946-896X,,,,,,,,,,,"Sovon Vogelonderzoek Nederland, Rijksstraatweg 178, NL-6573, DG Beek-Ubbergen, Netherlands",,,,2003-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14002013190,,,,,

Results indicate that SAR data overestimate the in-situ measurements resulting in an average bias of 0.7 m/s, which was gradually increasing in parallel to the wind speed values. Errors also proved to vary spatially with Akrotiri demonstrating the highest average errors comparing to Pafos and Larnaca.

In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill was among the largest marine disasters in history. While many predicted catastrophic consequences for nearshore fishes, field studies indicate surprising resilience in populations and communities. One potential mechanism for this resilience is the recognition and behavioral avoidance at small spatial scales of the toxic chemical constituents found in oil. Previous research indicates many marsh fishes have the capacity to avoid oil contaminated areas. Here, we test whether prior oil exposure of a common marsh fish, the Gulf killifish Fundulus grandis, alters this avoidance response. Using choice tests between unoiled and a range of oiled sediments, we found that, even at low levels of previous exposure, killifish lose recognition of oiled sediments. Preference for unoiled sediments was lost across the entire range of oil concentrations tested here after oil exposure, and some evidence for preference of oiled sediments was even demonstrated. These results provide evidence for lack of response to toxic environments in exposed individuals, suggesting sublethal impairment of sensory mechanisms on an individual level despite organism survival. Future research should highlight additional sublethal consequences that affect ecosystem and food web functioning.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Florida,,,,2022-11-15,PPRN:22542061,,,,,

Having first demonstrated that late gas-forming structures are present in coals of anthracite rank (>2% R-0) we go on to examine other rocks at the immature stage of maturity and report on how to recognise which might generate significant amounts of late dry gas at geologic temperatures well in excess of 200 degrees C in the zone of metagenesis (R-0 > 2.0%), i.e. subsequent to primary and secondary gas generation by thermal cracking of kerogen or retained oil. Such a distinction could clearly be of major value when assessing risks and pinning down sweet spots. A large selection (51 samples) of source rocks, i.e. shales and coals, stemming from different depositional environments and containing various types of organic matter which contribute to the formation of petroleum in putative gas shales were investigated using open- and closed-system pyrolysis methods for the characterisation of kerogen type, molecular structure, and late gas generative behaviour. A novel, rapid closed-system pyrolysis method, which consists of heating crushed whole rock samples in MSSV-tubes from 200 degrees C to 2 different end temperatures (560 degrees C; 700 degrees C) at 2 degrees C/min, provides the basis for a newly proposed approach to discriminate between source rocks with low, high, or intermediate late gas potential. It is noteworthy that late gas potential goes largely unnoticed when only open-system pyrolysis screening-methods are used. High late gas potentials seem to be mainly associated with heterogeneous admixtures or structures in terrestrially influenced, in some cases marine, Type III and Type II/III coals and shales. Aromatic and/or phenolic signatures are therefore indicative of the possible presence of elevated late gas potential at high maturities. High temperature methane was calculated to potentially contribute an additional 10-40 mg/g TOC, which would equal up to 30% of the total initial primary petroleum potential in many cases. Low late gas potentials are associated with homogeneous, paraffinic organic matter of aquatic lacustrine and marine origin. Source rocks exhibiting intermediate late gas potentials might generate up to 20 mg/g TOC late dry gas and seem to be associated with heterogeneous marine source rocks containing algal or bacterial derived precursor structures of high aromaticity, or with aquatic organic matter containing only minor amounts of aromatic/phenolic higher land plant material.

Traditional organic tin and copper oxide coatings are toxic and will contaminate seawater and destroy marine ecology and have been banned or restricted. Environmentally friendly antifouling coatings have become a research hotspot. Among them, the use of natural biological products with antifouling activity as antifouling agents is an important research direction. In addition, some fouling release coatings without antifoulants, biomimetic coatings, photocatalytic coatings and other novel antifouling coatings have also developed rapidly.

During transportation the chance of oil spillage over the water body occurs due to accidents or by deliberate action during war time and this causes environmental pollution. Sorbents made from structured fibre assembly are found to be the best material to clean up oil spill. The oil sorption and retention behavior of sorbents are influenced by the material and structure of the sorbents and oil physical characteristics. For sustainable environment, disposal of used sorbents is a major issue. In this context, the naturally available biodegradable materials have great potential than the synthetic ones.

In this study, we incubated surface water from the DWH site with amendments of crude oil, Corexit dispersant, or both for 36 days under natural sunlight in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The bacterial community was analyzed over time for total abundance, density of alkane and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degraders, and community composition via pyrosequencing. Our results showed that, for treatments with oil and/or Corexit, sunlight significantly reduced bacterial diversity and evenness and was a key driver of shifts in bacterial community structure. In samples containing oil or dispersant, sunlight greatly reduced abundance of the Cyanobacterium Synechococcus but increased the relative abundances of Alteromonas, Marinobacter, Labrenzia, Sandarakinotalea, Bartonella, and Halomonas. Dark samples with oil were represented by members of Thalassobius, Winogradskyella, Alcanivorax, Formosa, Pseudomonas, Eubacterium, Erythrobacter, Natronocella, and Coxiella.

The diversities and numbers of microbes were monitored through enrichment culturing; the dominant strains propagated at first, but the enrichment could not be continued, which indicated that the prolonged culture was not effective in the enrichment of the micro-consortium. Oxygen was also observed to affect the propagation of the dominant microbes. The results showed the role of culture strategies and oxygen in the enrichment of the petroleum-degrading microbes.

This paper serves to share the evolution of UMaine's scale-model testing pedigree by exploring the various test campaigns at a high level, culminating with the design validation of the VolturnUS floating platform. These model test campaigns have each provided key insights into the behavior of FOWT platforms as well as improving the ability to perform model tests of FOWTs. In 2011, the UMaine-led DeepCwind Consortium carried out 1/50-scale model tests of a generic tension leg platform (TLP), a semi-submersible (semi), and a spar-buoy (spar) floating platform at the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN) test facility. The designs were Froude-scaled and supported a scaled version of the 5-MW National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) offshore research turbine. Data from these tests has been used extensively for numerical simulation validation efforts using NREL's computer-aided engineering software FAST and laid the foundation for UMaine's design efforts on VolturnUS. In 2013, UMaine conducted another test campaign at MARIN using the original semi-submersible from 2011 with an improved turbine as well as a 1:50-scale model of the VolturnUS concrete semi-submersible design. The improved DeepCwind semi-submersible data is currently being utilized in the validation of a large number of other analysis codes as part of the International Energy Agency's 005 project. In 2015, UMaine opened its own Wind/Wave test facility, the Alfond Wind/Wave Ocean Engineering Laboratory (W2). Utilizing this new facility, UMaine tested the 1:50-scale model DeepCwind semi-submersible, repeating the tests from MARIN, to validate the experimental equipment and procedures as well as demonstrate the capability of the W2. In 2016 UMaine carried out testing of a 1:52-scale model of the 100% design of the VolturnUS with a 6-MW topside as a final design validation to support the US Depaitment of Energy supported, full-scale Aqua Ventus demonstration project scheduled to be connected to the grid in 2019.

Chemical and isotopic data indicate the presence of at least three genetic groups of gases in these basins: biogenic gas, thermogenic gas, and gases with mixed origin. Thermogenic gases produced from the Yacheng field are characterized by relatively high contents of benzene and toluene, relatively low VC values of toluene, and high abundance of bicadinanes and oleanane in the associated condensates, showing good correlation with the coal-bearing sequence of the Yacheng Formation in the Qiongdongnan Basin. In contrast, the gases from the DF1-1 and LD gas fields contain high amounts of N-2 and CO2, low to moderate amounts of benzene and toluene, with relatively high VC values of toluene. These characteristics correlate well with the Miocene neritic shales in the Yinggehai Basin. Analyses on potential source rock samples indicate excellent gas source potential for both the coal-bearing sequence in the Yacheng Formation and the Miocene neritic shales containing type IIIsimilar toII2 kerogens. As the result of recent rapid subsidence and sedimentation, high temperature and overpressure systems are well developed in the Yinggehai and Qiongdongnan basins. The rapid heating resulted in advanced maturation of organic matter deposited in normally pressured and overpressured strata, whereas the strongly overpressured systems led to retarded organic matter maturation, postponing the time when the source rocks reached peak gas generation. Results of 1-D modeling indicate that the coal-bearing Yacheng Formation in the Yacheng Sag reached peak gas generation during mid Miocene-Pliocene time, after the deposition of upper Oligocene to lower Miocene reservoir rocks. The lower-mid Miocene marine shales reached their peak gas generation stage during the Pliocene-Quaternary in the central Yinggehai basin, supplying abundant gases to charge the Pliocene reservoirs. More importantly, focused-episodic gas migration significantly increased the hydrocarbon expulsion efficiencies of source rocks' and thus provided favorable conditions for the accumulation of large amounts of gases in the diapiric structures in a very short geological time. The gas-source relationship for the Yacheng field suggests dominantly short-distance gas migration and thus strong source facies controls on the geographic distribution of gas fields within the Qiongdongnan Basin.

All EU countries are required to have Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) guidelines in place for such developments and whilst tracking studies of marine predators have been recommended to aid EIAs, they are as yet not a requirement. This study tracked Northern Gannets breeding on Les Etacs, a stack immediately offshore Alderney, Channel Islands, to determine their use of both local and international waters and examine the consistency between an individual's foraging trips. The 15 Northern Gannets that made at least two foraging trips foraged in three different territorial waters and their combined home-range area overlapped with nine potential offshore marine renewable energy developments. Repeatability between the first and second foraging trips made by an individual was apparent when considering the direction travelled and the maximum distance travelled from the colony, but not when considering the percentage overlap in core foraging areas, trip duration, or the total trip distance suggesting individuals did not appear to be dependent on specific foraging areas. Our findings highlight the need to consider all important seabird colonies which forage in the range of potential offshore developments and to use tracking technology to determine which colonies may be affected by such developments and the colony's dependence on these areas. Tracking studies of birds from important seabird colonies should form an integral part of the EIA process for marine renewable developments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Over the years, numerous environmental disasters have occurred caused by the sinking of oil tankers and which had a devastating impact on the entire coastal ecosystem. Among the most important disasters that occurred in the Mediterranean, there was the one caused by the Haven oil tanker sinking in the sea near Genoa in April 1991 where about 144.000 tons of crude spilled out in the sea. This study reports the simulation results of potential hydrocarbon beaching due to spills of petroleum products at sea and attributable to maritime accidents or accidents on offshore oil platforms. In particular, the lower Adriatic area was analyzed where, on the coastal strip, there is an important ecosystem preserved by the Regional Natural Park of the Coastal Dunes (BR). The study is part of the research project SLAT - Integrated UAV / UTV system with remote control for the pollutants dispersion assessment in the coastal environment for remediation in collaboration with the Department of Earth and Geoenvironmental Sciences of the University of the Bari, Serveco Srl and LETG (Littoral, Environnement, Teledetection, Geomatique CNRS) in Rennes, which aims to develop new monitoring and analysis technologies of the anthropic impact on coastal systems.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,0,3,,,2035-8008,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bari, Dept Earth & Geoenvironm Sci, I-70121 Bari, ItalyServeco Srl, I-74020 Montemesola, Taranto, Italy",Serveco Srl,,,2020-12-16,WOS:000586757400003,,,,,

A significant breakthrough was made with the Gaoshi-1 risk-taking exploration well deployed in 2011. As of 2015, the proven geologic reserves of natural gas were 657.4 billion m(3), and the total gas reserves including proven reserves, controlled reserves, and predicted reserves exceeded 1.5 trillion m3. A total of three sets of gas-bearing strata are developed in the Anyue gas field in a descending sequence: The gas reservoir in the Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation (C11) is treated as a structure-lithologic gas reservoir; the gas reservoir in Section No. 4 of the Dengying Formation (Z(2)dn(4)) is a structure-stratigraphic gas reservoir; and the gas reservoir in Section No. 2 of the Dengying Formation (Z(2)dn(2)) is a structural gas reservoir. A comparative analysis of the gas sources has shown that the gas Cambrian of reservoirs was mainly from mudshale of the lower Cambrian Maidiping and Qiongzhusi formations and the gas of the Dengying Formation reservoirs was from mudshale of the Qiongzhusi Fonnation and mudstone of Section No. 3 of the Dengying Fonnation. All gas reservoirs are refei led to as reservoirs of dry gas with medium or low contents of sulfur and medium contents of CO2. Gas reservoirs in (sic)(1)1 are characterized by a large burial depth, a high temperature, and a high pressure, while the gas reservoirs in Z(2)dn(2) and Z(2)dn(4) are characterized by an ultralarge depth, a high temperature, and a normal pressure. The accumulation of gas reservoirs is controlled mainly by two factors. The distribution of hydrocarbon generation centers is controlled by the late Sinian-early Cambrian intracratonic rift, which acts as effective updip sealing conditions for gas reservoirs in the Dengying Formation. The late Sinian-early Cambrian Gaoshiti-Moxi paleouplift experienced a long-term inherited development, which controlled the generation and distribution of three sets of large-scale high-quality reservoirs in Z(2)dn(4), Z(2)dn(2), and the Longwangmiao Formation and the generation of three sets of high-quality reservoir-caprock assemblages.

Numerous offshore wind farms are planned or under construction in the North and Baltic Seas, which will increase underwater noise during both construction and operation. A better understanding of how anthropogenic impacts affect the behaviour, health, endocrinology, immunology and physiology of the animals is thus needed. The present study compares levels of stress hormones and mRNA expression of cytokines and acute-phase proteins in blood samples of harbour porpoises exposed to different levels of stress during handling, in rehabilitation or permanent human care. Free-ranging harbour porpoises, incidentally caught in pound nets in Denmark, were compared to harbour porpoises in rehabilitation at SOS Dolfijn in Harderwijk, the Netherlands, and individuals permanently kept in human care in the Dolfinarium Harderwijk and Fjord & Belt Kerteminde, Denmark. Blood samples were investigated for catecholamines, adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine, as well as for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, metanephrine and normetanephrine. mRNA expression levels of relevant cell mediators (cytokines IL-10 and TNF[alpha], acute-phase proteins haptoglobin and C-reactive protein and the heat shock protein HSP70) were measured using real-time PCR. Results: Biomarker expression levels varied between free-ranging animals and porpoises in human care. Hormone and cytokine ranges showed correlations to each other and to the health status of investigated harbour porpoises. Hormone concentrations were higher in free-ranging harbour porpoises than in animals in human care. Adrenaline can be used as a parameter for the initial reaction to acute stress situations; noradrenaline, dopamine, ACTH and cortisol are more likely indicators for the following minutes of acute stress. There is evidence for different correlations between production of normetanephrine, metanephrine, cortisol and the expression of IL-10, HSP70 and haptoglobin. Conclusions: The expression patterns of the selected molecular biomarkers of the immune system are promising to reflect the health and immune status of the harbour porpoise under different levels of stress.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1746-6148,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Terr & Aquat Wildlife Res, Foundation, Busum, D-25761, Germany",,,,2014-03-27,ZOOREC:ZOOR15004016967,,,,,

A total of 12 340 individual prey items of 35 different food types was found. Fish was the most important food type in the diet, constituting 32% by number and 93% by mass. Insects contributed 67% by number but only 3% by mass. The main food types were sciaenid fishes Paralonchurus brasiliensis, Micropogonias furnieri, Cynoscion guatucupa and Macrodon ancylodon. Several of these are important commercial species; fisheries potentially impact food availability to the terns, and terns may contribute significantly to the natural mortality of these fishes. Clupeiform fishes, the urophycid fish Urophycis brasiliensis and flying ants (Camponotus sp.) were also important. Species composition of the diet (food types), both by number and by mass, differed significantly between months. Prey sizes ranged in length from 12.7 mm to 217.4 mm. The average estimated total length of fish taken was 77.7 mm, but the mean differed significantly among prey species. The importance of demersal sciaenids to the diet of the Common Tern, a surface predator, may be explained by their association with aquatic predators, especially adult Bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix and Striped Weakfish Cynoscion guatucupa, and the Franciscana Dolphin Pontoporia blainvillei, which drive these fish to the surface. The occurrence of flying ants in the diet was related to offshore winds, which carried these insects out to sea. The occasional high availability of insects possibly changed the cost/benefit relationship of several food types, causing diet changes. The high number of prey species, the temporal variations in the composition of the diet and the wide range of prey sizes are evidence of the high dietary plasticity of the Common Tern, at wintering areas in southern Brazil.",,,,,,,,,55,0,1,0,53,7,68,,,0019-1019,1474-919X,,,,,,,,,,"Fundacao Univ Fed Rio Grande, Dept Oceanog, Lab Elasmobranquios & Aves Marinhas, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil",,,,2004-07-01,WOS:000222207000007,,,,,

Optodes have the potential to measure in situ pCO(2) without the need for wet chemicals or bulky gas equilibration chambers that are typically used in pCO(2) systems.

The pCO(2) optode spot was illuminated with low intensity light (0.2 mA, 0.72 mW) to minimize spot photobleaching. The spot was calibrated using an experimental gas calibration rig prior to deployment, with a determined response time (tau(63)) of 50 s at 25 degrees C.

Several structural developments of a previous trap design improved urea (killing solution) retention and capture of cyprids of both species. The design adopted for assessment of the larval supply/settlement relationship of the focal species, S. balanoides, included additional internal baffles and the replacement of the cylindrical trap opening with a coned aperture. Three sizes of cone aperture area were compared, with the intermediate size (1 cm(2)) being optimal for measuring larval supply over the full range of wave action oil local shores. Most daily catches included larvae that were recognizable as having been dead before they were trapped, and had recently passed through the guts of grazing limpets (Patella vulgata L.). One site showed that similar to 32% of trapped S. balanoides were so-called 'faecal' cyprids. An inabilitv to distinguish these in trap samples would lead to a significant over-estimation of larval supply. Preliminary data indicated that S. balanoides larval supply to the intertidal is enhanced by onshore winds (or perhaps increased wave turbulence), whereas B. crenatus supply was positively correlated with offshore winds (or decreased turbulence). A clear 'supply/settlement' relationship for S. balanoides at six sites along similar to 40 km of coastline was derived from 1cm(2) coned trap catches and daily counts of settlement on ceramic tiles. There were no instances of disproportionately high settlement in relation to larval supply, but at five sites there were days when settlement apparently failed. The identification and explanation of settlement success and failure is fundamental to understanding the importance of larval Supply in structuring marine benthic Populations and communities.

Energy and offshore activities in the North Sea are critically vulnerable to climate change along the full supply chain. The major vulnerabilities for offshore installations like rigs, offshore wind energy and pipelines concern wind storms and extreme wave heights, whereas on land coastal installations and transportation may also be adversely affected by flooding. Future renewable energy potentials in the North Sea are also susceptible to climate change. Whereas the hydropower potential is expected to increase, it is highly uncertain how much the future potential of other renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, terrestrial biomass, or emerging technologies like wave, tidal or marine biomass could be positively or negatively affected.

This complex behaviour enables animals to exploit many temporally productive and spatially discrete habitats to accrue various fitness benefits (e.g. growth, reproduction, predator avoidance). Human activities and global environmental change represent potential threats to migrating animals (from individuals to species), and research is underway to understand mechanisms that control migration and how migration responds to modern challenges. Focusing on behavioural and physiological aspects of migration can help to provide better understanding, management and conservation of migratory populations. Here, we highlight different physiological, behavioural and biomechanical aspects of animal migration that will help us to understand how migratory animals interact with current and future anthropogenic threats. We are in the early stages of a changing planet, and our understanding of how physiology is linked to the persistence of migratory animals is still developing; therefore, we regard the following questions as being central to the conservation physiology of animal migrations. Will climate change influence the energetic costs of migration? Will shifting temperatures change the annual clocks of migrating animals? Will anthropogenic influences have an effect on orientation during migration? Will increased anthropogenic alteration of migration stopover sites/migration corridors affect the stress physiology of migrating animals? Can physiological knowledge be used to identify strategies for facilitating the movement of animals? Our synthesis reveals that given the inherent challenges of migration, additional stressors derived from altered environments (e.g. climate change, physical habitat alteration, light pollution) or interaction with human infrastructure (e.g. wind or hydrokinetic turbines, dams) or activities (e.g. fisheries) could lead to long-term changes to migratory phenotypes. However, uncertainty remains because of the complexity of biological systems, the inherently dynamic nature of the environment and the scale at which many migrations occur and associated threats operate, necessitating improved integration of physiological approaches to the conservation of migratory animals.",,,,,,,,,72,0,0,0,63,0,79,,,2051-1434,,,,,,,,,,,"Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, CanadaCarleton Univ, Dept Biol, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S, CanadaLeiden Univ, Inst Biol, Sylvius Lab, Sylviusweg 72, NL-2333 BE Leiden, NetherlandsMax Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Migrat & Immunoecol, Radolfzell am Bodensee, GermanyUniv Konstanz, Dept Biol, Constance, GermanyCtr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, EnglandCarleton Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",,,,2016-02-29,WOS:000375205700001,27293751,,,,

Tidal energy is an emerging and promising renewable energy resource. Tidal turbines can extract energy from the flowing water in a similar way as wind turbines extract energy from the wind. The upside with tidal turbines is that the density of water is approximately 800 times greater than that of air and a tidal turbine harnessing the same amount of power as a wind turbine can be considerably smaller in size. At the heart of the horizontal axis marine current turbines are carefully designed hydrofoil sections. While there is a growing need to have hydrofoils that provide good hydrodynamic and structural performances, the hydrofoils also have to avoid cavitation for safe operation. This study uses a genetic algorithm optimization code to develop hydrofoils which have the desired qualities mentioned above. The hydrofoil problem is parameterized using a composite Bezier curve with two Bezier segments and 11 control points. Appropriate curvature conditions are implemented and geometric constraints are enforced to maintain the hydrofoil thickness between 16 to 18%. XFOIL is used as the flow solver in this study. The hydrofoils are optimized at Reynolds number of 2 million and for angles between 4 to 10 degrees. The best foil from the results, named USPT4 is tested for performance with the CFD code ANSYS CFX.

Detailed paleoceanographic studies have documented abrupt changes in these processes over timescales ranging from centuries to millennia. Most of these major shifts in oceanic productivity and biodiversity are attributable to changes in Earth's climate, manifested through large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions. By comparison, contemporary biodiversity and plankton community dynamics are generally considered to be static, in part due to the lack of a suitable time frame of reference, and the absence of oceanic data to document ecosystem change over relatively short timescales (decades to centuries). Here we show that the average concentrations of chlorophyll a (chl a) and the estimated rates of primary production in the surface waters of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) off Hawaii have more than doubled while the concentrations of dissolved silicate and phosphate have decreased during the past three decades. These changes are accompanied by an increase in the concentration of chl b, suggesting a shift in phytoplankton community structure. We hypothesize that these observed ecosystem trends and other related biogeochemical processes in the upper portion of the NPSG are manifestations of plankton community succession in response to climate variations. The hypothesized photosynthetic population domain shift toward an ecosystem dominated by prokaryotes has altered nutrient flux pathways and affected food web structure, new and export production processes, and fishery yields. Further stratification of the surface ocean resulting from global warming could lead to even more enhanced selection pressures and additional changes in biogeochemical dynamics.

Here we present a methodological approach for the identification of genes that encode metabolically active enzymes in environmental microbes in a culture-independent manner. Our method is based on activity-based single-cell sequencing, which focuses on microbial cells showing specific enzymatic activities. First, at the single-cell level, environmental microbes were encapsulated in water-in-oil microdroplets with a fluorogenic substrate for the target enzyme to screen for microdroplets that contain microbially active cells. Second, the microbial cells were recovered and subjected to whole genome amplification. Finally, the amplified genomes were sequenced to identify the genes encoding target enzymes. Employing this method, we successfully identified 14 novel beta-glucosidase genes from uncultured bacterial cells in marine samples.

Within Brazil the introduction is linked to shipping connected to petroleum platforms. In Maranhao and Para the introduction may have occurred as a result of fish sheltering in fouling on hulls of ships moving between ports around the mouth of the Amazon River.

Meiofauna appeared to be highly sensitive to hydrocarbon stress since the oil spill determined an observable decline in density, relative to the pre-pollution conditions. Such patterns were unusual since reported in a period in which, because of the usual seasonality of Mediterranean meiofauna, we would expect an increase in density. In particular, clear decreases in nematode, turbellarian and foraminiferan densities were observed. Oil-induced disturbance had no influence on copepods, which slightly increased after the oil spill, probably because they were dominated by epibenthic forms which were able to escape from the toxic effects of hydrocarbon pollution. The results of classification anti ordination analyses as well as the univariate indices indicated that the level of the major meiofaunal groups was not sufficient for detecting oil-induced disturbance, but nematodes at the genus level proved to be highly efficient. The oil spill determined evident changes in terms of a decrease in N-1 diversity, Changes were also observed in richness and in the k-dominance curves of nematode genera, showing a decrease in overall community diversity. One month after the oil spill, diversity patterns were similar to pre-pollution conditions. In contrast, the nematode:copepod ratio and its modifications were not sensitive to the induced stress and proved to be inadequate for detecting hydrocarbon pollution. Similarly, no significant variations were observed when analysing the index of trophic diversity. However, the nonselective deposit feeding nematodes (1B) declined after the oil spill thus indicating possible changes in the functional characteristics of the meiobenthic assemblages. Meiofaunal response to oil pollution was extremely rapid. Meiofaunal structure was significantly affected only immediately after the oil spill (22 April 1991). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that the structural characteristics of meiobenthos recovered after only 2 weeks and were almost indistinguishable from pre-pollution conditions a few weeks later, indicating the high resilience of these meiobenthic assemblages.",,,,,,,,,98,2,1,0,83,4,110,,,0025-326X,1879-3363,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV CAGLIARI, DIPARTIMENTO BIOL ANIM & ECOL, I-09100 CAGLIARI, ITALYSTATE UNIV GHENT, INST ZOOL, MARINE BIOL SECT, B-9000 GHENT, BELGIUM",,,,1995-02-01,WOS:A1995QM59200007,,,,,

The most efficient way to prevent the negative effects of wind power plants is to avoid building on presumably high-risk sites, which requires an understanding of the movement patterns and habitat use of vulnerable species. The White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) is vulnerable to wind energy in terms of both collision mortality and displacement due to disturbance. We used satellite transmitters to study the movements of juvenile and sub-adult White-tailed Eagles. We developed a Resource Selection Function (RSF) to model their habitat use at the Finnish coast, which holds about 80% of all planned and constructed wind power plants in the country. In addition, we made a collision risk assessment by calculating how likely areas are to be visited by a flying White-tailed Eagle at both planned and existing wind-farm areas. Our resource selection model predicted 83% of the observations correctly. We found that sub-adult White-tailed Eagles preferred areas close to their natal sites, the coastline and archipelagos. They avoided the open sea, urban areas and other constructed areas such as cottages, industrial areas and agricultural fields. The White-tailed Eagles flew lower over the sea (median 20 m) than over land (median 80 m), and time spent flying at risk heights (50-200 meters) was greater over land (28%) than over the sea (19%). Due to preferences for different habitat types and varying flight heights, our estimates of relative collision risks differed up to 1,000-fold at the Finnish coast. This illustrates the power of our resource selection model, which can be used to model White-tailed Eagle flying behaviour and habitat use in any given area and provide useful information for landscape planning when searching for the safest areas for wind-energy development.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,0,8,,,0030-5685,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Oulu, Ecol & Genet Res Unit, POB 3000, Oulu 90014, FinlandUniv Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, FinlandNat Resources Inst Finland, LUKE, Itainen Pitkakatu 4, Turku 20520, Finland",,,,2019-02-01,WOS:000456258000001,,,,,

Development in the marine environment may affect marine bird populations. Red-throated divers are known to be displaced, causing effective habitat loss, by construction and operation of offshore wind farms, with this effect primarily seen during the non-breeding season when divers use areas of offshore wind development. However, the energetic, physiological and demographic consequences of displacement are currently unknown. If divers are already energetically constrained in the non-breeding season, they may struggle to meet the additional energetic demands following displacement. The aim of the Red- throated Diver Energetics Project (https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/rtde-project/) is to collect and compare novel data on foraging and movement behaviour of red-throated divers in the breeding and non-breeding season. In 2018, the Red-throated Diver Energetics Project tagged 74 divers breeding in Iceland, Orkney, Shetland and Finland with archival time depth recorder (TDR) and geolocator (GLS) tags. In 2019, tagged divers were found, caught and tags removed to obtain data on their approximate location and their dive behaviour in the 2018/19 non-breeding season. Analyses of these data are presented in a separate report (JNCC Report No. 638). The present report describes the 2019 breeding season, tag retrieval/redeployment and tag/trapping effects on red-throated divers. Recapturing tagged divers was challenging. Locating tagged birds was difficult and catching them took much longer than during tag deployment in 2018. A total of 27 tagged divers were caught and tags removed. Of these, 18 were fitted with new TDR and GLS tags to obtain information on inter-annual variation in foraging behaviour for the same individuals. A further 15 sets of tags were deployed on divers that had not been tagged previously. In 2020, attempts will be made to recapture divers carrying these newly deployed tags plus divers carrying the 2018 deployment that were missed in 2019. Three methods were used to look for any tag and trapping effects: resighting rates of tagged divers, changes in body mass of tagged divers between 2018 and 2019 and breeding success at nest sites where trapping was attempted compared with control sites. Additionally, mortality of three tagged divers was considered in the context of bycatch rates of ringed divers. Across all sites (countries) combined, the resighting rate of tagged divers was reported to be 69% (n=50 tagged divers seen) although this varied from 53% to 92% depending on site. For a long-lived species, a resighting rate of 80-90% would be expected. However, finding tagged divers was challenging and it is possible that tagged birds did return but were not seen. Alternatively, divers may not breed every year, irrespective of whether they are tagged. Without a marked control group of untagged divers, e.g. by using colour rings on untagged divers, it is not possible to make a quantitative evaluation of this resighting rate. Body mass of tagged divers retrapped in 2019 was not significantly different to their body mass in 2018. This suggests that carrying tags does not reduce body condition in individuals that returned to breed. However, it was not possible to look at body mass of tagged birds that were not recaptured so our sample could have been biased. Breeding success was found to be significantly lower at nest sites where trapping was attempted, compared with control nest sites (breeding success = 38% at trapped nests, 58% at control nests for Scotland and Finland, combined), although evidence for this effect in Finland was weak. This suggests that disturbance from attempting to catch divers to deploy or retrieve tags can increase the likelihood of a breeding attempt failing, but that this effect was seen more strongly in some trapping locations than others. Mortality of three Finnish tagged divers was reported during August 2018-June 2019, with two due to drowning in freshwater nets and a third of unknown causes. Bycatch is known to be a problem for adult red-throated divers, e.g. 75% and 60% of ring recoveries of Finnish-and British-ringed divers, respectively, were due to being caught in a net, where cause of death was known. However, drowning in a net set in freshwater is much more common in Finland compared with Britain (60% and 8%, respectively, of mortalities of known cause for ringed divers). Therefore, these mortalities of tagged divers could have happened irrespective of them carrying tags. Despite breeding success potentially being decreased by attempts to trap divers, and no discernible tag effects (i.e. no decrease in body mass of tagged divers detected) we still recommend trying to recapture and remove as many tags as possible from red-throated divers. It is still possible that ongoing undetected tag effects exist and, given the red-throated diver life history strategy of high adult survival and low productivity, the population will better withstand short-term reductions in productivity from trapping over any small decrease in adult survival due to carrying tags for many years.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-08-28,ZOOREC:ZOOR15709060085,,,,,

As part of the wider characterisation of Scotland's seas, this study developed criteria and a methodology that follow the established principles of the terrestrial, Great Britain-wide geoconservation audit, the Geological Conservation Review, to assess geodiversity key areas on the seabed. Using an expert judgement approach, eight geodiversity feature categories were identified to represent the geological and geomorphological processes that have influenced the evolution and present-day morphology of the Scottish seabed: Quaternary of Scotland; Submarine Mass Movement; Marine Geomorphology of the Scottish Deep-Ocean Seabed; Seabed Fluid and Gas Seep; Cenozoic Structures of the Atlantic Margin; Marine Geomorphology of the Scottish Shelf Seabed; Coastal Geomorphology of Scotland; and Biogenic Structures of the Scottish Seabed. Within these categories, 35 key areas were prioritised for their scientific value. Specific interests range from large-scale landforms (e.g. submarine landslides, sea-mounts and trenches) to fine-scale dynamic features (e.g. sand waves). Although these geodiversity interests provided supporting evidence for the identification and selection of a suite of Nature Conservation Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) containing important marine natural features, they are only partially represented in these MPAs and existing protected areas. Nevertheless, a pragmatic approach is emerging to integrate as far as possible the conservation management of marine geodiversity with that of biodiversity and based on evidence of the sensitivity and vulnerability of geological and geomorphological features on the seabed.

Underwater noise generated during the installation of steel monopiles has recently received considerable attention from international environmental organizations and regulatory bodies in various nations. Collected data regarding underwater noise measurements indicate that pile driving operations, especially when impact hammers are used, can be potentially harmful for the marine ecosystem. In this paper, a linear semi-analytical model is developed for the study of the vibroacoustic behaviour of a coupled pile-soil-water system. The hammer is substituted by an external force applied at the head of the pile. The pile is described by a thin shell theory, whereas both soil and water are modelled as three-dimensional continua. The solution is based on the dynamic sub-structuring technique. The total system is divided into two subsystems namely, the shell structure and the soil-fluid medium. The response of each sub-domain is expressed as a summation over a complete set of eigenfunctions. The orthogonality of the shell modes in vacuo and the bi-orthogonality of the acousto-elastic modes is utilized in order to meet the displacement compatibility and the force equilibrium at the interface of the two sub-systems. With the developed model, the wave radiation due to vibratory and impact pile driving is analysed. The influence of soil elasticity and soil stratification on the dynamics of the coupled system is examined. In addition, the energy launched by the hammer into the water and into the soil is investigated for both excitation types in order to highlight the main differences in the generated wave field.",,,,,9th International Conference on Structural Dynamics (EURODYN)9th International Conference on Structural Dynamics (EURODYN),"JUN 30-JUL 02, 2014JUN 30-JUL 02, 2014",,"Porto, PORTUGALPorto, PORTUGAL",4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,2311-9020,,978-972-752-165-4,,,,,,,,,"Delft Univ Technol, Fac Engn & Geosci, Dept Civil Engn, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands",,,,2015-06-25,WOS:000354786604023,,,,,

Suction caissons have appeared as an efficient and economic alternative for foundations in the offshore industry. This concept, however, is relatively new, so the knowledge about their behavior has not yet gone far deep as that for other offshore foundation solutions such as driven pile systems. This paper reports some results from an experimental investigation into the installation of upright and tapered suction caissons. The 1g experiments have been carried out on eight small scale suction caissons. The aspect ratios, (the caisson length/its diameter) have been 1, 2, 3 and 4. The diameter has been constant and equal to 80 mm. Four specimens have had upright walls while the other four had a positive wall slope of 10%. The caissons have been installed in a soil tank containing very fine saturated silty sand. The penetration has been achieved under forced driving using a constant penetration rate. The effects of geometrical parameters and the soil density on the overall penetration force have been studied. it has been observed that, with both the upright and tapered caissons, the required force for full penetration increases by an increase in the aspect ratio. The penetration force required for full penetration of tapered models, has been two to three times higher than an equivalent upright caisson. With tapered caissons, the penetration forces have been found to be more sensitive to the soil density as compared to that with upright caissons.

As depicted on the maps included in this report, the human pressures are so powerful that they are altering the marine ecosystem, depleting the renewable resources beyond safe biological limits, and jeopardizing the future uses of the Baltic ecosystem goods and services. Obviously, our environmental remedial measures so far have not been sufi cient to prevent the alarming ecosystem shift taking place today. However, tools have been developed to assess the state and find cost-efficient solutions to restore the marine ecosystem and improve its unacceptable status. Status This HELCOM Initial Holistic Assessment shows that the environmental status of the Baltic Sea is generally impaired (Chapter 2). None of the open basins of the Baltic Sea has an acceptable environmental status at present. The integrated assessment of the 'ecosystem health' has revealed that only very few coastal areas along the Gulf of Bothnia can be considered healthy. To reach the commonly agreed aim of a healthy Baltic Sea in 2021 at the latest, the Baltic Sea Action Plan urgently needs to be implemented to its full extent. Eutrophication, caused by nutrient pollution, is a major concern in most areas of the Baltic Sea. The Bothnian Bay and the northeastern parts of the Kattegat are the only open areas of the Baltic Sea not affected. The only coastal areas not affected by eutrophication are coni ned to the Gulf of Bothnia. Despite significant reductions of the nutrient inputs over the past, all other open basins and coastal waters are classii ed as 'areas affected by eutrophication'. HELCOM has been very successful in reducing the inputs of nitrogen and especially phosphorus to the Baltic Sea. During the decade from 1990 to 2000, the direct point-source inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen decreased by 68% and 60%, respectively. From 1990-2006, the total inputs to the Baltic Sea were reduced by 45% for phosphorus, but only 30% for nitrogen. For atmospheric nitrogen deposition, the picture is different: There was a much smaller decrease since the mid-1990s and an increase in the period from 2003 to 2007. Shipping in the Baltic Sea is an important contributor to the atmospheric nitrogen deposition, and will signii cantly increase in the future. Living organisms and bottom sediments are affected by hazardous substances in all parts of the Baltic Sea. Despite targeted abatement strategies, measures, and also signii cant reductions of inputs of hazardous substances, only very few coastal sites presently seem undisturbed by hazardous substances. At present, the key substances of concern include PCBs, heavy metals, TBT, dioxins, DDT/DDE, PAHs and alkylphenols. However, several management actions have proved to be successful, for example, reducing atmospheric inputs of mercury, lead, and cadmium, and reducing the inputs of certain persistent organic pollutants, such as DDT, PCBs and TBT, by banning their use in the Baltic Sea region. Concentrations of radioactive substances originating from the Chernobyl fallout are still high in the northern, eastern, and central parts of the Baltic Sea, but the concentrations of the radionuclide cesium- 137 are decreasing in all areas of the Baltic Sea. The status of biodiversity appears to be unsatisfactory in most parts of the Baltic Sea. According to the prelim- inary results of the biodiversity assessment, 82% of the coastal areas assessed exhibit an unfavourable status. Environmentally alarming shifts and unbalances appear in many habitats and at all levels of the food chain, particularly at the level of large i sh. Promising signs of successful remediation measures include an improvement in the status of top predators such as grey seals and white-tailed eagles during recent decades. The results of this HELCOM Initial Holistic Assessment are based on HELCOM's thematic assessments of the 'eutrophication status', the 'biodiversity status' and the 'hazardous substances status'. As an added value, these thematic assessments have been integrated to assess the 'ecosystem health', thereby setting a baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of the implementation of the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan. Pressures For the first time in an assessment of a regional sea, all the relevant pressures and their impacts have been identii ed and ranked by a special index, the Baltic Sea Pressure Index and the Baltic Sea Impact Index (Chapter 3). The further development of the Baltic Sea Impact Index should be seen as a process in which the data layers and the index need to be continuously improved. Ultimately, the goal is to develop an index for decision support as well as solution targeting, which can take into account regional differences. Most prominently, the marine environment is under pressure by anthropogenic loads of nitrogen, phosphorus, organic matter, and hazardous substances. But commercial fishing is also a strong and widespread pressure, which severely impacts the Baltic Sea ecosystem. Especially bottom trawling is a very destructive fishing technique which affects large areas of the sea. The seabed is also disturbed by construction works, dredging and the disposal of dredged material, which can have large impacts on local marine environments. Comparing the pressures on a Baltic Sea-wide scale, it is obvious that pressures are high in the western, southern and eastern parts of the Baltic Sea. Coastal areas are affected mainly by pollution stemming from point sources as well as the disturbed seabed. The open-sea areas are mainly affected by i shing, riverine pollution, and atmospheric nitrogen deposition. It can be concluded that the cumulative impact of human activities is high in all areas except the open-sea areas of the Gulf of Bothnia. Pressures causing eutrophication are mainly related to inputs of nutrients from external sources, whether via water or air, and to a lesser extent internal sources such as sediments that have retained anthropogenic inputs from the past. Pressures causing contamination and pollution effects by hazardous substances are either related to the inputs of synthetic or natural compounds from external sources, whether via water or air, or to inputs from contaminated bottom sediments caused by physical disturbance of the seabed following, for example, construction activities, dredging or disposal of dredged material. Releases of oil to the marine environment represent a continuous pressure on the Baltic Sea. Releases of oil not only cause pollution effects, but can also directly harm biodiversity. For example, seabirds are highly susceptible to oil pollution. Pressures including the selective extraction of species by commercial i sheries and by hunting of seals and seabirds directly disturb biodiversity. The greatest concern in this respect relates to the elimination of top predators. Biodiversity is also impaired by numerous types of physical disturbances which take place in most, if not all, coastal zones and also in large areas of the open sea. These disturbances include smothering of benthic organisms from disposal of dredged materials, abrasion of the sea bottom caused by bottom trawling and dredging, and changes in salinity or temperature regimes. Underwater noise and marine litter are forms of physical disturbance which also have the potential to disturb life in the Baltic Sea, but with effects that are less well known. Solutions Solutions and associated actions to restore the health of the marine ecosystem are offered in Chapter 4. Solutions providing multiple positive effects are recommended for prioritization. Their cost-effectiveness can in many cases be increased through multiple positive effects. It is vital to reduce all types of anthropogenic pressures. The greatest emphasis should be placed on reducing nutrient inputs and the environmentally negative impact of fishing activities. Inputs of hazardous substances and oil pollution should be reduced as well. To prioritize actions in a targeted way, the spatially explicit status analyses regarding eutrophication, pollution by hazardous substances, and biodiversity need to be combined with the basin-wide ranking of pressures. However, getting the sub-basin priorities and actions right is one of the future challenges for implementing the ecosystem approach to the management of human activities. In addition, physical disturbance to habitats and species should be reduced, for exale, by planning, controlling and reducing construction activities, operation of maritime structures (such as wind farms, oil refineries or platforms), commercial bottom trawling and noise (from shipping, wind farms and other sources). Nature restoration is a useful, but currently not widely used, tool. For example, the re-establishment of the top levels of the marine food chains should be promoted by ensuring the recovery of the populations of cod, harbour porpoises, seals, predatory birds, as well as pike and pikeperch in the coastal areas. Natural habitats should be restored more widely, especially in areas where important or protected marine habitats have been lost. Nature restoration should not be restricted to the marine territory, but should also extend to coastal wet- lands, which provide indispensable ecosystem services by filtering out nutrients and potentially also hazardous substances, increasing biodiversity and enhancing sequestration of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the restoration of river habitats, river water quality and their hydromorphology could contribute to reducing the flow of nutrients and hazardous substances into the Baltic Sea. At the same time, this would improve the state of the spawning populations of migratory fish. A key priority in this respect is the establishment of an ecologically coherent network of well-managed marine protected areas (MPAs). Coherence alone is not enough, especially if the management and enforcement of programmes of measures for MPAs are weak and restrictions on human activities poor. Banning or strictly regulating commercial i shing within MPAs should be the first step in the process of enhancing nature protection and restoring i sh stocks. The current governance issues, or rather lack of governance, should be addressed without delay and also linked to the upcoming implementation of maritime spatial planning. Noting that the Baltic Sea Action Plan is based on the ecosystem approach to the management of human activities, it should be evident that Baltic Sea Maritime Spatial Planning should apply the same principles, including the ecosystem approach as one of the main principles to ensure cross-sectoral policy integration as outlined in the EU Maritime Policy (Anon. 2007) and attaining good environmental status of the marine environment. Ecosystem goods and services Chapter 5 indicates that environmental gains are economic gains, too. The Baltic Sea provides us with many valuable services including transport, energy, food, mineral resources, recreational facilities and cultural heritage. Of the 24 marine ecosystem services identified in the Baltic Sea, only ten are operating properly and seven are under severe threat. The seven threatered ecosystem services are: the food web, biodiversity, habitats, Baltic Sea resilience (the capacity of the sea to resist and recover from disturbances), food, genetic resources, and aesthetic values. Eutrophication and overfishing have been identfii ed as the main threats to ecosystem services in the Baltic Sea. There are huge economic values at stake in the Baltic Sea today. From an economic perspective, we cannot afford to wait. Actions will be costly and constitute a severe challenge to the leadership skills of the Baltic Sea nations, but there is an undeniable risk that it will be much more costly not to take actions immediately, due to potentially serious effects on highly valuable ecosystem services.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,0,11,,,0357-2994,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2010-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14702016789,,,,,

However, the most distinctive differences of offshore and onshore turbines are in their support structures only. So the drawbacks and limitations of propellers remain. We note the limited unit power capacity, infrasound emission, and the harmful effect on birds and animals.The following tasks were set: to increase substantially unit capacity of wind power plants, to work safely under extra wind loads, to enhance wind speed range, to reduce wind energy cost, to eliminate infra sound emission and fatal injury of birds due to turbine rotation. They can be reached with the recently suggested concept of wind turbines called Wind Energy Marine Unit (WEMU).The WEMU turbine features a large-scale (more than 100 m in diameter) circular floating rotor. A semi-submerged pontoon bears vertical columns with a circular deck and rotary blades. In this way, water supports the rotor during slow rotation about vertical axis. This paper describes the design of the WEMU turbines and its perspective applications. Approaches, methods, and main results of aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, and strain-state research are presented.Because of large dimensions and problems in similarity criteria, well-verified CFD-methods with full-scale 3D domains are used for most of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic calculations. Flow through the turbine is described by RANS equations with chosen turbulent models. Numerical aerodynamic experiments are carried out using the finite-volume method with several geometrical models of the rotor. Discretization, grid, and calculation conditions are described. As a rule, the computation domain is presented by a non-conformal grid of hexahedral elements and is divided into rotary and stationary zones.Approaches and main results of aerodynamic simulations are presented here in brief. Aerodynamic efficiency of the WEMU turbine about 50% is guaranteed by an optimal control of rotation of vertical blades.Numerical calculations of water flow around the rotary pontoon show that a circular flow (water ring) arises after several seconds. Positional stability of the water ring is investigated. Simple method of wave generation is proposed to evaluate of a total power loss for real sea conditions. It is show that a relative hydrodynamic loss can be less than 6 % in case of limited waves and currents. Wave impact on the semi-submerged pontoon is moderate.Stress-strain analysis is coupled with CFD-results. 3D deflections of floating rotor connected to the hub by cables are described by the set of nonlinear equations. Iterative Newton method is used to find out main design parameters of the pontoon and cables.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-60741-849-8,,,,,,,,,"FEB RAS, Inst Automat & Control Proc, Moscow, Russia",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000278498900006,,,,,

This is made possible by deployment of instrumentation on remotely operated vehicles used for providing power and data flow and for precise positioning on targets of interest. Early prototype systems have now been replaced by compact and robust units that have been deployed well over 100 times on an expeditionary basis over a very wide range of ocean depths without failure. Real-time access to the spectra obtained in the vehicle control room allows for expedition decision making. Quantification of some of the solutes in seawater or pore waters observed in the spectra is made possible by self-referencing to the ubiquitous v(2) water bending peak. The applications include detection of the structure and composition of complex thermogenic gas hydrates both occurring naturally on the sea floor and in controlled sea floor experiments designed to simulate the growth of such natural systems. New developments in the ability to probe the chemistry of sediment pore waters in situ, long thought impossible candidates for Raman study due to fluorescence observed in recovered samples, have occurred. This permits accurate measurement of the abundance of dissolved methane and sulfide in sediment pore waters. In areas where a high gas flux is observed coming out of the sediments a difference of about X30 between in situ Raman measurement and the quantity observed in recovered cores has been found. New applications under development include the ability to address deep-sea biological processes and the ability to survey the sea floor chemical conditions associated with potential sub-sea geologic CO2 disposal in abandoned oil and gas fields.",,,,,,,,,49,11,0,0,16,0,59,,,0003-7028,1943-3530,,,,,,,,,,"Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USAChinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Marine Geol & Environm, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Shandong, Peoples R China",,,,2012-03-01,WOS:000300599300002,22449300,,,,

We used ornithological radar in 2001 - 04 to characterize the behavior of eiders migrating past Northstar Island, an oil-production island near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, and to assess the effects of a hazing-light system on migrating eiders. Eider radar targets exhibited pulsed, irregular periods of movement; movement rates were higher when sea ice was present, without precipitation, and during tailwinds and crosswinds but were not affected by lights. Velocities (ground speeds) were higher when ice was present and with strong tailwinds. They were lower at night when the lights were on, but higher during the day when the lights were on. Radar targets exhibited little variation in flight behavior as they passed the island; the proportion of non-directional behavior was larger when ice was present, with tailwinds, with weak winds, and near the full moon when it was not visible. Lights had no effect on flight behavior. Birds tended to exhibit more course changes as they approached the island, greater angular changes when they changed course, and larger net increases in passing distance as a result of those course changes when the lights were on; however, none of these differences were statistically significant.

For seabirds, MPAs include those near breeding colonies, offshore foraging areas, inshore habitats for wintering species, and migratory bottlenecks. However, frequently there is a lack of readily available current and comprehensive data on foraging areas used by species from particular colonies. Therefore, representative breeding season foraging ranges for each species may be useful alongside other datasets for scoping candidate MPAs. We reviewed studies that estimated foraging range for 25 species of UK breeding seabirds. For representative foraging ranges, we prioritised studies, giving highest value to those based on direct tracking of birds (21%); then those involving indirect estimates using flight speeds and time activity (12%) followed by, boat, aerial, and land-based 'survey' observations (46%); and finally we gave lowest value to speculative estimates (21%). Highest confidence was placed in the foraging ranges of northern gannet (Morus bassanus), black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), and common guillemot (Uria aalge), and lowest for common gull (Larus canus), common eider (Somateria mollissima), Leach's (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) and European storm petrels (Hydrobates pelagicus). Both annual and colony-specific variation was evident for some species. Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), northern gannet, and northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), had the largest foraging ranges (maximum ranges >330, 590 and 580 km, respectively), whereas red-throated diver (Gavia stellata) and little tern (Sternula albifrons) had the smallest (maximum ranges 9 and 11 km, respectively). Representative foraging ranges may be useful to suggest likely colony-specific foraging areas, prior to habitat-association modelling for defining candidate MPAs. The approach here has international applicability, and would help progress towards more comprehensive protection of seabird populations. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the yolk-added product showed a smaller value of yield stress and a markedly smaller value was shown at a soybean oil to sardine meat ratio of 1.1. The consistency and flow behavior indexes of increasing shear rate determination were larger in the yolk-added product than in the 'whole egg'-added product. In the yolk-added product, the oil droplets were smaller, more uniform and larger in number. Therefore, the sum of the interactions between the oil droplets was larger. This microstructure is related to the above rheological results. A drastic change in shear response was found between a soybean oil ratio of 1.1 and 1.7 in both the 'whole egg'-added and the yolk-added products but was more pronounced in the yolk-added product. When the shear rate vs. shear stress hysteresis loop of the yolk-added product was considered in comparison with that of the 'whole egg'-added product, at a low oil ratio the structure breakdown was not induced by the shear, and at a high oil ratio a great structure breakdown was induced. This result means that the three dimensional structure developed with the high oil ratio was broken down by the shear. In the products with higher oil ratios of 1.7 and 2.5, the relative amount of emulsifier to oil was very small. Therefore, the emulsifying layer around an oil droplet was thin, and the oil droplets tended to coalesce without the shear. If shear was applied, the emulsion was easily broken down due to the further progress of coalescence. From microscopic observation, it was found that many large oil droplets were present in the products with higher oil ratios of 1.7 and 2.5.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1341-027X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1993-01-01,WOS:A1993MP07200008,,,,,

Vent gas from the deep subsurface is the starting material from which other carbon pools are derived, including gas hydrate, free hydrocarbon gas in sediment, and authigenic carbonate rock. Gas crystallizes as exposed mounds of structure II gas hydrate and as massive vein-fillings in hemipelagic mud. Venting rates from gas hydrate mounds periodically increase after the temperature of the bottom water increases. Gas hydrate decomposition is largely restricted to exposed hydrate and at shallow depth in sediment. Overall, gas hydrate is accumulating, not decomposing at study sites. Most free gas in sediment appears to be destroyed in situ by anaerobic microbial oxidation in chemosynthetic communities, leading to sequestration of carbon as abundant authigenic carbonate rock depleted in C-13. Free methane is rapidly oxidized leaving residual methane enriched in C-13. Some in situ microbial CO2 reduction occurs, and methane depleted in C-13 mixes with vent methane enriched in C-13. The C-2-C-5 hydrocarbons of vent gas initially most depleted in C-13 (ethane, isobutane, isopentane) are least affected by microbial oxidation, whereas hydrocarbons initially enriched in C-13 (propane, normal butane, normal pentane) are most affected. Anaerobic microbial oxidation of all C-1-C-5 hydrocarbon gases, not only methane, may be significant in chemosynthetic communities. Microbial processes contribute to the development and stability of chemosynthetic communities by providing required H2S. Anaerobic microbial processes lead to deposition of diagnostic authigenic minerals related to the carbon (carbonate minerals) and sulfur cycles (pyrite, elemental sulfur), altering the seafloor. Seafloor cementation favors fauna such as chemosynthetic tubeworms and seep mussels by forming carbonate hardgrounds on an otherwise unfavorable mud-dominated seafloor. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The evidence for anthropogenically induced climate change is overwhelming with the production of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels being a key driver. In response, many governments have initiated programmes of energy production from renewable sources.2. The marine environment presents a relatively untapped energy source and offshore installations are likely to produce a significant proportion of future energy production. Wind power is the most advanced, with development of wave and tidal energy conversion devices expected to increase worldwide in the near future.3. Concerns over the potential impacts on biodiversity of marine renewable energy installations (MREI) include: habitat loss, collision risks, noise and electromagnetic fields. These factors have been posited as having potentially important negative environmental impacts.4. Conversely, we suggest that if appropriately managed and designed, MREI may increase local biodiversity and potentially benefit the wider marine environment. Installations have the capacity to act as both artificial reefs and fish aggregation devices, which have been used previously to facilitate restoration of damaged ecosystems, and de facto marine-protected areas, which have proven successful in enhancing both biodiversity and fisheries.5. The deployment of MREI has the potential to cause conflict among interest groups including energy companies, the fishing sector and environmental groups. Conflicts should be minimized by integrating key stakeholders into the design, siting, construction and operational phases of the installations, and by providing clear evidence of their potential environmental benefits.6. Synthesis and applications. MREI have the potential to be both detrimental and beneficial to the environment but the evidence base remains limited. To allow for full biodiversity impacts to be assessed, there exists an urgent need for additional multi and inter-disciplinary research in this area ranging from engineering to policy. Whilst there are a number of factors to be considered, one of the key decisions facing current policy makers is where installations should be sited, and, dependent upon site, whether they should be designed to either minimize negative environmental impacts or as facilitators of ecosystem restoration.",,,,,,,,,298,0,0,0,145,0,327,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, EnglandUniv Exeter, Sch Biosci, PRIMaRE, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, EnglandUniv Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, PRIMaRE, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandUniv Plymouth, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",,,,2009-12-01,WOS:000272193300002,,,,,

Some controls over food web regimes may be internal, but many are mediated by conditions or fluxes over large spatial scales. To understand locally observed changes in food webs, we Must learn more about how environmental gradients and boundaries affect the fluxes of energy, materials, or organisms through landscapes or seascapes that influence local species interactions. Marine biologists and oceanographers have overcome formidable challenges of fieldwork on the high seas to make remarkable progress towards this goal. In river drainage networks, we have opportunities to address similar questions at smaller spatial scales, in ecosystems with clear physical structure and organization. Despite these advantages, we still have much to learn about linkages between fluxes from watershed landscapes and local food webs in river networks. Longitudinal (downstream) gradients in productivity, disturbance regimes, and habitat structure exert strong effects oil the organisms and energy sources of river food webs, but their effects on species interactions are just beginning to be explored. In fluid ecosystems with less obvious physical structure, like the open ocean, discerning features that control the movement of organisms and affect food web dynamics is even more challenging. In both habitats, new sensing, tracing and mapping technologies have revealed how landscape or seascape features (e.g., watershed divides, ocean fronts or circulation cells) channel, contain or concentrate organisms, energy and materials. Field experiments and direct in situ observations of basic natural history, however, remain as vital as ever in interpreting the responses of biota to these features. We need field data that quantify the many spatial and temporal scales of functional relationships that link environments, fluxes and food web interactions to understand how they will respond to intensifying anthropogenic forcing over the coming decades.

The present paper deals with quantitative modeling of the statocyst system in three cephalopod species: Octopus vulgaris, Sepia officinalis and Loligo vulgaris. The octopus's macula/statolith organ was modeled as a 2nd-order dynamic oscillator using parameter values estimated from scanning electron micrograph images. The modeling results agree reasonably well with experimental data (acceleration threshold) in the three cephalopod species. Insights made from quantitative modeling and simulating the particle motion sensing mechanism of cephalopods elucidated their underwater particle motion detection capabilities.

Conventional marine fish-based feeds provide essential nutrients including long chain tatty acids for piscivorous species such as sablefish. Alternative terrestrial ingredients could reduce fishing pressures on pelagic species that are the source of fish meal and fish oil, and improve source sustainability. Using juvenile sablefish, we compared the effects of a standard fish-based diet to two diets that contained primarily terrestrial plant ingredients with flaxseed or corn oil replacing the added fish oil. After an 8-week trial feeding period, there were striking differences attributable to diet. Fish receiving the alternative feeds had lower weight gain and shorter length than fish receiving the fish-based feed, suggesting sablefish obtained lower nutrients from the alternative feeds. Among the histological differences, the intestinal mucosa was significantly less vacuolated and the frequency of intestinal mucous cells was reduced in alternative feed fish. The most dramatic lesions were observed in the liver, where severe bile duct hyperplasia (53%, flaxseed oil diet; 33%, corn oil diet), and hepatocellular lesions (nuclear pleomorphism/megalocytosis, regeneration, hypertrophy, clear cell foci) occurred in only alternative feed fish. The hepatic and biliary lesions indicate the alternative diets may be deficient or possibly harmful to sablefish. The bacterial community structures from corn oil fish showed much less diversity than those for the other diets, and the microbiome structures from the three diets were distinctly different from each other. The intestinal microbiome for the fish-based diet included the largest number of families (68), and these fish also had the largest number of unique bacterial families (11) compared to those for corn oil (two) or flaxseed oil (one) fish. Regardless of diet, the stomach and intestinal microbiomes differed significantly from each other, and the feed microbiome differed from all gastrointestinal communities, suggesting that feed is not a significant source of gut bacterial diversity. Similar to other teleosts, the sablefish gastrointestinal microbiome is dominated by Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteiia. These results suggest that diet induced shifts in microbiome can occur relatively quickly in sablefish, but the shifts may not be sufficiently adaptive or cannot overcome nutrient deficiencies. This multidisciplinary study demonstrates the utility of histology and microbiology in characterizing dietary effects for novel aquaculture species.Statement of relevance: Physiological assessments such as gastrointestinal microbiomes and histopathology can provide a near-term evaluation of the nutritional adequacy of alternative feeds, such as plant-based lipid diets for marine carnivorous finfish.

Two well-preserved outcrops -8 km apart and inferred to be within similar to 10-50 km from source represent the discontinuously exposed, layered, paleosol-bounded, phreatomagmatic AO Member. They show an identical phenocrystal assemblage of feldspar, biotite and amphibole without weathered zones or signs of erosion, that suggest deposition in one eruption phase lasting hours to months. The succession contains three subunits: 1) subunit A, 1.8 m thick, a series of well-sorted fine to coarse ash or lapilli tuff layers with constant thickness; 2) subunit B, 2.1 m thick, a series of normal-graded layers with an upper fine-grained zone containing abundant ash aggregates with a coarser-grained core and distinctively finer-grained outer rim; 3) subunit C, 4.5 m thick, a massive, poorly to well-sorted coarse ash with gas escape structures and ash aggregates at its base. The upward change of these lithofades implies an initially sustained dry fallout-dominated deposition of ash and pumice lapilli resulting in subunit A. Subsequently, multiple wet and dilute Pyroclastic Density Currents (PDCs) dispersed subunits B and C. The general abundance of PDC-related ash aggregates in the middle-upper part of the succession (particularly in subunit B), and the transformation of a fall-dominated to a collapsing depositional regime producing wet dilute PDCs, imply the increasing influence of water during the eruption (Phreatoplinian sensu lato). The presence of water is related to an epicontinental sea during Middle to Late Miocene in the Carpatho-Pannonian region.

Thus, this paper assesses the influence of water depth, mooring line diameter as well as added inertia and drag coefficients on the behaviour of a deepwater turret-moored FPSO platform. The commercial software, AQWA, is used to conduct fully coupled time-domain dynamic analysis for the FPSO subjected to a unidirectional random wave.

The purpose of this study is to predict using various computational chemistry techniques the hydrophobicity of the selected prepolymers. The more hydrophobic the prepolymer, the more encapsulation of the oil droplets within the foam cells during the foaming process is expected to be. This should allow the sea area to be restored to its original state without harming its surrounding habitat or inhabitants. In order to elect the best candidates for this type of application, organic substrate candidates of various R groups, various diols of different types and lengths, and various hard block sequence length distribution have been modeled in order to evaluate their miscibility with hydrocarbon oil.

It is known that marine birds such as red-throated divers are highly sensitive to disturbance caused by the construction and operation of offshore wind farms and are subsequently displaced from areas used in the non-breeding season. But the physiological, energetic and demographic consequences of such effective habitat loss is currently unknown. This report details the third field season of the Red-throated Diver Energetics Project (https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/rtde-project). During 2018-2020, archival geolocator (GLS) and time depth recorder (TDR) tags were deployed and retrieved from red-throated divers breeding in Scotland, Finland and Iceland to quantify foraging behaviour and approximate non-breeding season locations. This empirical data will provide insight into the time divers spend foraging, thus providing insight into whether divers potentially have capacity to accommodate displacement effects of offshore wind development. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, no fieldwork for the Red-throated Diver Energetics Project was carried out in Scotland in 2020. However, some breeding success monitoring and ringing of chicks was carried out by local ringing groups, during which, one adult tagged bird was caught, and its tags removed. In Finland, 15 tagged birds were resighted and eight of these were trapped. In Iceland, six tagged birds were trapped. Tags were also recovered from three dead birds during winter 2019/20. No tags were deployed in 2020. Breeding success was calculated as the total number of nests producing at least one fledged chick (% grown) divided by the number of nests of known fate. Breeding success during summer 2020 was variable between sites, ranging from 35% in Shetland to 59% in Finland and 66% in Orkney. The success rates in both Orkney and Finland were average compared to 2018 and 2019, however for Shetland the success rate was poor compared to the previous two years. Breeding success metrics for Iceland were unavailable at the time of writing. If leg-mounted tags have a negative impact on divers, e.g. by increasing drag on divers' legs when diving for prey, then we would expect body condition of tagged birds to be lower in 2020, compared with when they were first tagged, after having carried tags for one or two years. Using body mass as a proxy of body condition, repeated weighing of the same individuals allows assessment of any change in body condition after carrying tags for one or two years. The mass of birds caught in 2020 was compared with the mass of when they were first caught and tagged in either 2018 or 2019. The average difference between first and second year of capture was 3.7g, suggesting negligible change over time, and this was supported by analysis which found no significant change in median body mass between captures. Of the 18 tagged birds recovered dead or recaptured during the 2019/20 winter and 2020 summer, a total of 14 TDR and 18 GLS tags were retrieved. In some cases, birds had lost a TDR tag (n=3) or did not have a TDR tag deployed (n=1). Data for a full winter period were available from 15 GLS tags, another two GLS tags failed to record any data and one GLS tag provided data for only some of the winter period. The problems with substantial GLS tag failure due to water ingression, encountered in 2019, were absent and tag failure rate for GLS tags retrieved in 2020 was low for a study of this sort. Ten TDR tags provided data for the post-breeding and mid-winter period, with batteries dying prematurely in two TDR tags, in October and November, and the remaining eight TDR tags recording until late December/early January, consistent with the TDR tags retrieved in 2019. Additionally, four TDR tags only recorded for short periods, until July, August or September, due to the tag casing being damaged. The cause of the damage is unknown but occurred during deployment. GLS tag data for two consecutive years are available for five birds and TDR tag data are available for three birds over two consecutive years, allowing for novel insight into interannual variation in location and foraging behaviour. Due to an absence of breeding success data for Iceland at the time of writing, it was not possible to conduct further analyses this year on trapping effects. Although 2020 was the third and final field season for Finland and Iceland, we hope that a third year of tag retrieval fieldwork can be undertaken in Scotland next year, subject to coronavirus restrictions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-11-21,ZOOREC:ZOOR15712083132,,,,,

We analysed seven microsatellite loci in 111 organisms collected throughout most of its geographical range to test long-standing hypotheses regarding its disjunct distribution. One locus was fixed and the number of alleles in polymorphic loci ranged from 2 to 24 (average 13.5). We found very high levels of polymorphism (overall He = 0.75) comparable to other congeneric species but no significant differences in genetic diversity among localities or between Pacific and Gulf of California populations (p > 0.1). Significant shifts in allelic and genotypic frequencies were detected at three loci, which resulted in a small but significant partitioning of genetic variance among California, Baja California and Gulf of California populations (F-ST = 0.007, p = 0.03) and between Gulf and Pacific populations (F-ST = 0.01, p = 0.004). The latter but not the former result was corroborated by analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) using the number of distinct alleles (F-ST ) and the sum of square differences of allele sizes (R-ST) as Euclidean distances. The evidence argues against contemporary gene flow between the gulf and the Pacific ocean and against an ancient invasion of the gulf with a founder effect.

For example, pile driving could damage the hearing of marine mammals while underwater explosions can also result in physical damage or death. Effective mitigation is required to reduce these risks, but the exclusion zones specified in regulations can extend over hundreds or thousands of metres and seals pose particular problems because they are difficult to detect at sea. Aversive sound mitigation aims to exclude animals from high-risk areas before dangerous activities take place by broadcasting specific acoustic signals. Field research is needed to identify signals that might be effective in eliciting short-term avoidance by marine species such as harbour seals (Phoca vitulina). A series of controlled-exposure experiments (CEEs) were undertaken to measure seal movements in response to acoustic deterrent devices (ADD) and predator calls, and to assess the effectiveness of candidate signals for aversive sound mitigation. Seals were fitted with UHF/GPS transmitters providing continuous high-resolution tracks and real-time transmissions of their locations. A tracking/playback vessel located seals at sea and transmitted either ADD signals or orca (Orcinus orca) calls over a range of distances while seals were foraging or moving between sites. Behaviour before, during and after exposure was analysed to assess responses. One-hundred and ten CEEs were assessed as being of at least 'adequate' quality. Of the 71 adequate trials with the Lofitech ADD, all 38 at ranges of <1 km (predicted received level 134.6 dB RMS re 1 mu Pa) elicited a response. The maximum response range was 3123 m (predicted RL: 111 dB RMS re 1 mu Pa). However, the responses observed did not always result in substantial movements away from the source, especially for seals that were travelling at the time of the exposures. More work is needed to better understand how exposure risks would be reduced in different scenarios. The mean net speed of horizontal movements for seals responding to aversive sounds (1.15 m s(-1)) was only 7% higher than their mean travel speed. Responses to broadcasts of orca calls were highly variable. The results suggest that signals similar to those generated by a Lofitech ADD could be used to reduce risks to harbour seals from pile driving and underwater explosions in coastal waters. More work will be needed to develop systems that match the requirements of industry and regulators and to explore whether these results can be generalized to offshore waters and to other phocids.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,,,,,,,"Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, ScotlandPathtrack Ltd, Otley, W Yorkshire, England",Pathtrack Ltd,,,2019-09-30,WOS:000484997200012,,,,,

It followed decades of development in power sector, aiming at optimum utilization of geographically dispersed resources, economy of scale, harnessing of hydro-energy in far-flung areas as well as thermal energy at mine-mouth power stations, development of gas-wells vis-A-vis gas-grid. Net result visible in this context has been formulation of state power grids, then regional grids, and now stepping towards evolution of national grid with transmission voltage going gradually from 132 kV to 800 kV class with intermediate voltages as 220 kV and 400 kV in AC system, while +/- 500 kV in DC system. In fact already thought process has started for going in favor of 1200 kV AC and +/- 800 kV DC. Size of thermal units moved up from as low as few MW to 660 MW. Of course side by side nineties saw a sea-change in policy that resulted in investment by private entrepreneurs consequent to unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution as distinct entities. Economy of scale did not remain a constraint. Distribution companies too joined the fray to supplement generation embedded into the system. Co-generation by manufacturers using otherwise waste or by-products and also captive generation, co-operative generation by a number of industries coming together have made it possible to enhance generation substantially.

The consequences of increased use of these devices for birds are unknown. Here we describe the wave-powered energy-generating devices currently either operational or in development and review the potential threats and benefits of these to marine birds, their habitats and prey. Direct negative effects include risk of collision, disturbance, displacement and redirection during construction, operation and decommissioning. Above-water collision is a particular concern with wind-powered devices, but, because of their low profiles, the collision risk associated with wave-powered devices is likely to be much lower. Conversely, wave devices also pose the novel threat of underwater collision. Wave-energy-generating devices may indirectly impact marine birds by altering oceanographic processes and food availability, with implications for trophic cascades. Through appropriate mitigation, wave-powered MREIs offer the potential to enhance habitats. Direct positive effects may include provision of roosting sites, and indirect positive effects may include prey aggregation due to suitable substrates for sessile organisms or because they act as de facto protected areas. The cumulative effect of these could be the improvement and protection of foraging opportunities for marine birds. Recent studies have been critical of the methods used in the assessment of wind-powered MREI impacts, which lack sufficient sample sizes, controls or pre-development comparisons. Here we suggest solutions for the design of future studies into the effects of MREIs. Wave-powered MREIs are certain to become part of the marine environment, but with appropriate planning, mitigation and monitoring they have the potential to offer benefits to marine birds in the future.",,,,,,,,,57,1,0,0,40,0,63,,,0019-1019,1474-919X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, PRIMaRE, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandUniv Plymouth, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandUniv Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, EnglandUniv Exeter, PRIMaRE, Sch Biosci, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England",,,,2010-10-01,WOS:000281852500002,,,,,

This is mostly because of their superior axial load carrying performance, low resistance against fluid loads and easy handling during construction and transportation. Cylindrical structural members, however, very often happen to become subject to accidental lateral damages which are detrimental to their load carrying performance. Collision between supply ships and legs and bracings of offshore oil platforms, impact from heavy dropped objects on these members or denting during installation of marine structures are examples of such accidents. Prior to an accident, cylindrical members are usually carrying their normal operational loads. It is very important to include the effects of this service load (pre-loading) in evaluation of the behaviour of impacted member. The pre-loading may change the dynamic characteristics of the member or degrade its load carrying capacity. While the performance of cylindrical members subjected to lateral impact has been extensively researched, few studies can be found on the impact behaviour of pre-loaded tubular members. This paper reports results from a numerical study on axial pre-loading effects on the dynamic and quasistatic behaviour of cylindrical shells subjected to transverse impact loads. Results obtained appear useful for a more realistic design of tubular members and in choosing feasible and reasonable post impact repairing and strengthening schemes.",,,,,26th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering26th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering,"JUN 10-15, 2007JUN 10-15, 2007",,"San Diego, CASan Diego, CA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4267-6,,,,,,,,,"Azad Univ, Tehran, Iran",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000249556900066,,,,,

Taking this observation seriously, the paper's aim is to investigate the critical interactions with earth forces (soil, climate, ocean, air, etc.) that ensue from the progressive dissemination and scaling up of wind power projects. It is to assess how the wind power expansion makes earth matter and if innovative earth politics emerge from these entanglements with these forces. The paper assumes that sites have a strategic role as it cannot be learned from these entanglements everywhere. To this end, it proposes to articulate Simondon's spatial approach to the emergence of technological objects (from 'intensive' to 'extensive' sites) with Latour's approach to the politics of Gaia through the notion of 'critical zone'. Two onshore and offshore wind power cases (France and Germany) are studied. Their spatial expansion interferes with polymorphous earth intensities (e.g. strong marine currents, coastal fish highways, moving seabed, large bird migrations), and raises critical issues about the fragmentation of the ecosystems. They point out the fact that these earth forces when observed, monitored and discussed could open the way to local experiments that provide them with a new relational existence and a new political status. Drawing on these observations, the paper challenges Simondon's approach to extensive diffusion of technological objects and emphasises that intensive relational work could as well underpin the expansion of technological objects. It also expands Latour's notion of critical zone in pointing out that projects scene are related to broader large scale environments.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,2214-6296,2214-6326,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Ctr Sci Res PACTE, 14 Bis Ave Marie Reynoard, F-38100 Grenoble, FranceNatl Ctr Sci Res CIRED, 45 Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France",Natl Ctr Sci Res PACTENatl Ctr Sci Res CIRED,,,2018-04-05,WOS:000427790500013,,,,,

The DSD will meet the current requirements of the regulatory regime, but provide flexibility to evolve in response to changing regulations. Stakeholders as partners is considered essential to a successful project and significantly increases the likelihood that outputs will be applied to real-world decision-making.Objectives:(1) To develop a user-friendly DSD to facilitate decision-making for understanding the impacts (positive and negative) of decommissioning operations on the condition of MPA qualifying features and site integrity;(2) To gather and assess (providing confidence scores) the best available scientific evidence to underpin the assessment of impacts of decommissioning options on major marine habitats and species, including taking an innovative natural capital focus;(3) To engage end-users (incl. industry, industry bodies, SNCBs, regulators & academia) throughout the project to provide proof of concept, identify sources of evidence and provide case studies;(4) To assess potential short and long-term impacts of decommissioning options on MPA qualifying features and site integrity using industry-led case study examples from the North Norfolk Sandbanks and Saturn Reefs cSAC/SCI, and(5) To provide end-users with an innovative and user-friendly evidence-based approach to better understand the risks, opportunities and impacts of decommissioning on MPAs and the wider marine environment.Impacts:Although it is unlikely that the full impacts of DECOM-MPA will be measurable within the project timescale, expected impacts will provide the best combination of:Environmental benefits:- maintained or enhanced MPA integrity;- reduced impact on marine ecosystems;- maximisation of ecosystem service provision;- improved scientific evidence base to support sustainable decommissioning (as well as renewable energy and other construction activities within MPAs).Economic benefits:- support a transparent decision process, decreasing the likelihood of challenging the method selection and reducing associated additional time and cost of regulatory reviews of decommissioning programmes;- early insights into risks and opportunities presented by decommissioning operations;- strengthened links with academia to influence the future research agenda to deliver industry-relevant knowledge, and- enhancing transferability potential of decision support products to other areas.Societal benefits:- enhanced sustainability and societal acceptability of selected decommissioning options;- translating existing knowledge to make it useable and accessible to users;- improved knowledge gained through research (cognitive benefits);- identifying unrealised benefits from decommissioning options within and out with MPAs;- identified knowledge gaps improving efficiency of public research spending, and- enhanced reputation by exporting UK scientific excellence to inform global decommissioning solutions.Keywords: Decision Support Document, stakeholders, Marine Protected Areas, decommissioning, oil & gas, evidence, assessment, case studiesKey Stakeholders: BEIS, JNCC, NE, SNH, Oil and Gas Industry, Oil and Gas Industry Representatives, Marine Scotland, MMO",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/P016553/1,,,,,,,,University of Hull,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15368488,,,,,

Shift work and especially night work disrupts the sleep/wake cycle and causes a desynchronization of the natural biological rhythms. Therefore, different shift schedules may have different impact on performance at work and health.Aim: The purpose was to study if health, reaction time, and the cortisol rhythm were negatively affected when a group of shift workers changed their work schedule from ordinary day-night shift (fixed shift) to swing shift.Methods and settings: 19 healthy workers on a Norwegian oil rig participated in the study. They worked 2 weeks offshore followed by 4 weeks off work. The ordinary schedule consisted of 12-h day shift and 12-h night shift every other work period (14 days or nights = fixed shift). Swing shift involved 1 week of night shift, followed by 1 week of day shift during the work period. All participants worked ordinary day night shift when baseline data were collected (questionnaires, saliva cortisol, and reaction time during work). After collection of baseline data the workers changed their work schedule to swing shift, for every working period, and 9 months later the same data were collected.Results: Swing shift did not give any negative health effects or any negative changes in reaction time during the day they shifted from night work to day work. Personnel adapted to night shift within a week regardless of schedule, but recovery from night shift took longer time. During swing shift the cortisol rhythm went back towards a normal rhythm in the second week, but it was not returned completely to normal values when they returned home for the 4 weeks off period. However, the cortisol rhythms were readapted to normal values after 1 week at home. For personnel returning home directly from 14 consecutive night shifts, cortisol adaptation was not complete after 1 week at home.Conclusion: We found no increase in health complaints from swing shift or reaction time in the shift from night to day work. Recovery from night shift takes longer time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We review several WBCs in the context of kinetic energy extraction. The power density in the Gulf Stream off North Carolina at times reaches several thousand watts per square meter at 75 m below the surface, and the annual average power is approximately 500-1,000 W m(-2). Significant fluctuations occur with periods of 3-20 days (Gulf Stream meanders) and weeks to months (Gulf Stream path shifts). Interannual variations in annual average power occur because of year-to-year changes in these WBC motions.

Therefore, it is important to study the interactions of offshore wave power devices with the marine environment. The Lysekil Project is a test park for wave power located about 100 km north of Gothenburg at the Swedish west coast. The concept is based on a linear wave power generator placed on the seabed, and connected via a wire to a buoy acting as a point absorber on the surface. Biofouling on offshore wave energy devices is an issue of concern for the operation or survival of the components. On the other side, these structures may provide habitats for marine organisms and thus increase biodiversity and form artificial reefs. In this chapter, size distribution and biomass of blue mussels on sheltered and exposed marking buoys are examined. Further, these results are used for calculating a worst case scenario of mussel growth on the lifting force of a specially designed toroidal buoy. The results show that more wave-exposed buoys were particularly favourable for blue mussel colonization, but that the hydrodynamic forces of the toroidal buoy were not affected by mussel growth.

Due to its strategic location, the Straits of Malacca serves as a major shipping lane. This paper expands the utility of biomarker compounds, hopanes, in identifying the source of tar-balls stranded on Malaysian coasts. 20 tar-ball samples collected from the east and west coast were analyzed for hopanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Four of the 13 tar-ball samples collected from the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia were identified as the Middle East crude oil (MECO) based on their biomarker signatures, suggesting tanker-derived sources significantly contributing the petroleum pollution in the Straits of Malacca. The tar-balls found on the east coast seem to originate from the offshore oil platforms in the South China Sea. The presence of South East Asian crude oil (SEACO) tar-balls on the west coast carry several plausible explanations. Some of the tar-balls could have been transported via sea currents from the east coast. The tankers carrying SEACO to other countries could have accidentally spilt the oil as well. Furthermore, discharge of tank washings and ballast water from the tankers were suggested based on the abundance in higher molecular weight n-alkanes and the absence of unresolved complex mixture (UCM) in the tar-ball samples. The other possibilities are that the tar-balls may have been originated from the Sumatran oil fields and spillage of domestic oil from oil refineries in Port Dickson and Malacca. The results of PAHs analysis suggest that all the tar-ball samples have undergone various extent of weathering through evaporation, dissolution and photo-oxidation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

At the Cocuina well, sampling occurred immediately before, and 15 days and 12 months after the perforation at 350 m depth. Principal component analysis and multidimensional scaling were used to assess spatial and temporal patterns of environmental and biotic variables. The temporal pattern was clear, as differences between samples decreased with time after perforation. The results suggest that drilling muds initially changed the chemistry of sediments, but that these changes apparently disappeared approximately two years after perforation and were homogenous at a spatial scale of up to I km from the perforation site.

Fluctuations in the daily body mass increments of Lesser-black-backed Gull chicks, mostly in chicks from 20 days of age and on, suggest that the adults failed to deliver sufficient prey at the time when the energetic demands were peaking. Herring Gulls in the Kelderhuispolder colony fed mostly on mussels, supplemented by shore crabs, various species of fish and other prey. Even chicks were mostly provisioned with mussels, but with an increasing proportion of (marine) fish in later stages of chick-care. Prey identifications suggest that most fish prey was obtained at fishing vessels. Lesser Black-backed Gulls nesting in the Kelderhuispolder fed primarily on marine fish, including many demersal species that were probably taken as discards from fishing vessels at sea. Their diet is supplemented mostly with swimming crabs, nereid worms and terrestrial prey. In 2007, relatively many clupeids were provided during chick care, which might explain the relatively high reproductive success in comparison with 2006 and 2008. Considering specific prey identifications, commercial beamtrawl fisheries were the mostly likely source for the majority of fish prey. From sightings of colour-ringed individuals, it is suggested that Herring Gulls and probably also Lesser Black-backed Gulls foraged mostly in the southern part of Texel, and along the shore of Noord-Holland (Den-Helder-IJmuiden). Breakwaters along the shore are of prime importance for Herring Gulls. From ringing data, however, given the dependence on the presence of ring-readers, their foraging range can only be partly studied. In particular the occurrence and distribution of foraging gulls at sea or deeper inland cannot be fully appreciated from colour ring-readings. An analysis of ship-based seabird counts at sea (ESAS 4.1) resulted in clear seasonal patterns in abundance of either species. Herring Gulls were abundant at sea in winter, but confined to a narrow coastal strip (<5km offshore) in summer. Lesser Black-backed Gulls, after their return in March, replaced Herring Gulls offshore. It was both the most abundant and widespread seabird in Dutch coastal waters in summer and left for wintering areas further south during September. Seabirds at sea surveys clearly showed how significant commercial fisheries offshore must be for these gulls. Of all Lesser Black-backed Gulls recorded, 45.7% were seen in association with fishing vessels. The same was true for 51.2% of all observed Herring Gulls. During the breeding season, Lesser Black-backed Gulls were numerically dominant in association with fishing vessels at distances >5km from the shore. Fisheries effort was found to decline in the course of summer, doubling the mean flock size attending trawlers and increasing the levels of inter- and intra-specific competition of the scavengers. Naturally feeding (plunge diving) Lesser Black-backed Gulls were seen in most of their range at sea, but large flocks were typically found within the 20m depth contour and in turbulent water areas between islands. Concentrations of plunge-diving Lesser Black-backed Gulls occurred around the 30m depth contour in the Frisian Front area, to the north of the Wadden Sea islands, but these birds did probably not originate from the Texel colony. In 2008, Lesser Black-backed Gulls could be equipped with GPS-loggers. It appeared that the main foraging areas of gulls carrying GPS loggers were located to the south and southwest of the colony, partly on land, but mostly at sea. The range of the majority of the feeding trips was less than 40km away from the colony and most trips were oriented to the SW. Despite this short range, several birds spent up to a couple of days away from the colony. The maximum feeding range was around 80km, S- SW of the colony. Nearly all offshore trips produced data (GPS upload clusters) indicating that fishing vessels were attended at least for some time. In conclusion: From at-sea seabird surveys, studies of seabirds associated with fishing vessels, and tracks of birds carrying GPS-loggers at sea, it is evident that Lesser Black-backed Gulls from Texel exploit a wide zone off the mainland coast of Noord-Holland and SW Texel. An analysis of prey items confirms their near-complete marine orientation and indicates a strong dependence on commercial fisheries in the area. Natural prey are obtained mostly within the 20m depth contour and Lesser Black- backed Gulls do forage to some extent on land. Two presently operating windfarms are situated within their normal feeding range. The absence of colonies of reasonable size in Noord-Holland (except IJmuiden), would make that any effect-studies of offshore windfarms in that region should focus on Texel colonies. In Herring Gulls, a marine orientation is prominent only in winter. During the breeding season, foraging is confined to intertidal and nearshore areas. Fish is captured mostly at fishing vessels within 5km from the nearest coast. Very few Herring Gulls use foraging opportunities further offshore.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0923-3210,,,,,,,,,,,"NIOZ, Postbus 59, 1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands",,,,2008-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14510064724,,,,,

Elevated levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were abundant in the upper water column throughout the event. Previous research suggests that PAHs may have negatively affected fishes in the northern GoM. Our objective was to test whether crude oil contamination from the DWH oil spill was correlated with changes in growth rates in adult Red Snapper, Lutjanus campechanus. We fit von Bertalanffy growth curves and back-calculated length-at-age using data collected from 2011-2013 during long-line surveys in the northern GoM and on the West Florida Shelf. No significant variation in von Bertalanffy growth parameters existed among the catch years; a combined-years model gave L-infinity, k, and t(0) values of 82.91, 0.20, and 0.43, respectively. No significant difference existed between pre- (back-calculated) and post-DWH growth curves. However, annual widths of the fourth, fifth, and sixth increments (the dominant cohorts in the population) declined significantly post-DWH (2010-2012) by 13%, 15%, and 22%, respectively, and were significantly smaller than the mean width of each respective increment in pre-spill years (2006-2009). While the DWH event was related temporally to growth declines in the dominant adult age groups, other environmental factors (winds, temperature, and river discharge) may also affect growth. Accordingly, meridional (V) and zonal (U) winds, sea level height anomalies (a proxy for water temperature variation), and Mississippi River discharge were compared to increment widths but none of the factors were strongly correlated with variation in age-specific growth increments (maximum Pearson's r= 0.47). Therefore, we are unable to reject the hypothesis that the DWH resulted in growth rate declines as opposed to climatic variation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study aims to identify environmental factors associated with the species presence, and map the probability of presence of the species across the western English Channel and southern Celtic Sea, and estimate the number of individuals in this area. Location: The western English Channel and southern Celtic Sea Methods: This study analyses strip transect data collected from vessel-based surveys in the western English Channel and southern Celtic Sea during the shearwaters post-breeding period between 2013 and 2017. Using environmental data collected directly and from remote sensors both Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and the Random Forest (RF) machine learning model were used to determine shearwater presence at different locations. Results: Both models indicated that oceanographic features were better predictors of shearwater presence than fish abundance. Seafloor aspect, sea surface temperature, depth, salinity, and maximum current speed were the most important predictors. Based on the timing of the surveys (mainly in October) it is probable that most of the sighted shearwaters were immatures. Main conclusions: Areas with consistently high probabilities of shearwater presence were identified at the Celtic Sea front. Our estimates suggest that the study area in southwest Britain supports between 2% and 23% of the global population of Balearic shearwaters. This study provides the most complete understanding of Balearic shearwater distribution in UK waters available to date, information that will help inform any future UK conservation actions concerning this endangered species. Data maximum_current_speed_Feb5_2020.rds is an ASCII of simulated maximum depth-averaged horizontal tidal currents (m s-1) during April 2016. Because of the persistence and predictability of tidal currents, these values are representative of those encountered in the study area during the surveys. Values were sourced from an existing Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) for western UK (Cazenave, Torres et al. 2016) and resampled at ~1km resolution using bilinear interpolation. Coordinates are decimal degrees (WGS84). Values were constrained to <=3m/s to prevent unrealistic predictions from GAMS/Random Forest models, although very few locations have values > 3 m/s in the study area. stratification_index_Feb5_2020.rds is an ASCII of the Hunter-Simpson Stratification Index (Simpson and Hunter 1974) obtained using the equation log10 (h/u3), where h is the water depth (m) and u is the maximum depth-averaged current speed (m/s). Values of the former are provided from existing FVCOM for western UK (see above) whereas seabed depth was sourced from EMODNet. To provide values at 1km resolution, current speed was resampled at ~ 1km resolution using bilinear interpolation, whereas depth was already provided at ~ 1km resolution. Coordinates are decimal degrees (WGS84). Values < 1.9 and > 1.9 indicate water columns likely to remain mixed and become stratified in summer months, respectively. Values of ~ 1.9 indicate probable locations of tidal fronts between these water masses.

Most of this period (13-19 and 21-27 September) had no gas-flaring events, but a major gas-flaring event occurred on the night of 20 September. Movement rates of targets on radar and of bird flocks recorded visually in the first similar to 50%-60% of the night were much lower during the non-flaring period than during the night of flaring, whereas rates in the last similar to 40%-50% of the night were similar in all periods. The general flight behavior of birds also differed significantly, with higher percentages of both radar targets and bird flocks exhibiting straight-line (directional) flight behaviors during the non-flaring periods and higher percentages of radar targets and bird flocks exhibiting non-straight-line (erratic and circling) flight behaviors during the gas-flaring period. During the night of gas flaring, the bright illumination appeared to have an effect only after sunset, when flocks of birds circled the island after being drawn in from what appeared to be a substantial distance from the island. On both radar and visual sampling, the number of bird flocks approaching the island declined over the evening, and the attractiveness of the light from flaring appeared to decline. The visibility of the moon appeared to have little effect on the behavior of birds. Because illumination from extensive gas-flaring is such a strong attractant to migrating birds and because most bird flocks fly at low altitudes over the water, flaring booms on coastal and offshore oil-production platforms in Arctic Alaska should be positioned higher than the mean flight altitudes of migrating birds to reduce the chances of incineration.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,14,0,16,,,0004-0843,1923-1245,,,,,,,,,,"ABR Inc, Environm Res & Serv, Fairbanks, AK 99708 USABP Explorat Alaska Inc, Anchorage, AK 99719 USA",ABR Inc,,,2015-09-01,WOS:000362696900010,,,,,

The reef situated down-current from the discharge point was monitored during 5 days and 15 h with a benthic lander equipped with a stills camera and current meter. This reef was exposed to drill cuttings 11 times during the monitoring. The total exposure time was 13 h 37 min. A remotely operated vehicle was used to provide additional images from both reefs for comparison. The proportion of polyps in different expansion states did not differ significantly between exposed corals and unexposed corals. Rather, changes in polyp behaviour were related to changes in current direction and velocity. A higher proportion of the polyps was expanded during periods with prevailing northeasterly currents compared to northwesterly. This could be related to quantity and type of food particles or the polyps' local position in the colony relative to current direction. There was also a clear difference in the degree of polyp expansion between polyps situated high up in the colony compared to low. This may be related to local environmental differences representing different hydrodynamic conditions.

More energy-efficient fisheries are also likely to alter existing fishing patterns, which already vary from fishery to fishery and from vessel to vessel. The impact assessment of new spatial plans involving fisheries should be based on quantitative bioeconomic analyses that take into account individual vessel decisions, and trade-offs in cross-sector conflicting interests. We use a vessel-oriented decision-support tool (the DISPLACE model) to combine stochastic variations in spatial fishing activities with harvested resource dynamics in scenario projections. The assessment computes economic and stock status indicators by modelling the activity of Danish, Swedish, and German vessels (> 12 m) in the international western Baltic Sea commercial fishery, together with the underlying size-based distribution dynamics of the main fishery resources of sprat, herring, and cod. The outcomes of alternative scenarios for spatial effort displacement are exemplified by evaluating the fishers's abilities to adapt to spatial plans under various constraints. Interlinked spatial, technical, and biological dynamics of vessels and stocks in the scenarios result in stable profits, which compensate for the additional costs from effort displacement and release pressure on the fish stocks. The effort is further redirected away from sensitive benthic habitats, enhancing the ecological positive effects. The energy efficiency of some of the vessels, however, is strongly reduced with the new zonation, and some of the vessels suffer decreased profits. The DISPLACE model serves as a spatially explicit bioeconomic benchmark tool for management strategy evaluations for capturing tactical decision-making in reaction to MSP.",,,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,21,0,37,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, Sect Ecosyst Based Marine Management, Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, DenmarkThunen Inst Sea Fisheries, Rostock, GermanySwedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, S-45330 Lysekil, Sweden",,,,2015-03-01,WOS:000351837500008,,,,,

The potential for offshore winds to form a lee-side eddy on the backshore or transfer sediment from the dune and berm crest to the water are evaluated, as are differences in wind speed and sediment transport on the dune crest, berm crest and a pedestrian access gap. The dune is 18-20m wide near the base and has a crest 4.5m above backshore elevation. Two sand-trapping fences facilitate accretion. Data were obtained from wind vanes on the crest and lee of the dune and anemometers and sand traps placed across the dune, on the beach berm crest and in the access gap. Mean wind direction above the dune crest varied from 11 to 3deg from shore normal. No persistent recirculation eddy occurred on the 12deg seaward slope. Wind speed on the berm crest was 85-89% of speed at the dune crest, but rates of sediment transport were 2.27 times greater during the strongest winds, indicating that a wide beach overcomes the transport limitation of a dune barrier. Limited transport on the seaward dune ramp indicates that losses to the water are mostly from the backshore, not the dune. The seaward slope gains sand from the landward slope and dune crest. Sand fences causing accretion on the dune ramp during onshore winds lower the seaward slope and reduce the likelihood of detached flows during offshore winds. Transport rates are higher in access gaps than on the dune crest despite lower wind speeds because of flatter slopes and absence of vegetation. Transport rates across dunes and through gaps can be reduced using vegetation and raised walkover structures.

This process could also be an effective method for on-site forming or repairing of large metal/composite sheets used in underwater applications, such as marine equipment, ships, and lake/sea-based offshore oil platforms. The underwater laser forming process is performed experimentally on a three-layered stainless steel/copper/stainless steel composite and compared with the results of in-air tests. Total forming time, bending rate, and microstructural changes are compared for both underwater and in-air conditions. The effects of forming parameters, such as the number of irradiations, laser beam velocity, diameter, and power, are also compared and discussed. It is shown that the bending angle per irradiation in underwater forming is significantly lower in comparison with in-air condition, but the production time is less due to the elimination of cooling time. Also, the microstructure of stainless steel at heat-affected zone was unchanged, and the hardness of upper layer experienced smaller changes when formed under water.

Three days after the spill only a small fraction of the oil remained.The effects on macrobenthic crustaceans within the first five weeks after the spill were studied at five stations with a varying degree of oil exposure, including one control site never reached by oil from the spill. Significant differencies between these stations were noted for total amphipod abundance, the amphipod genus Ampelisca and ostracods (retained on a 0.3 mm mesh), but not for amphipods of the genus Corophium. At the most heavily impacted station (23 mu g oil g(-1) sediment dry weight), the total amphipod abundance, dominated by Ampelisca verrilli, decreased by 86% within the first two weeks after the spill. Decreases in total amphipod abundance significantly larger than at the control site were noted also at two other stations, one of which with only trace amounts of oil detected in the sediment. The amphipod populations at these sites were dominated by juvenile specimens.These findings confirm the extreme sensitivity to oil pollution of amphipods and ostracods, noted in earlier field and experimental studies.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,0,9,,,0018-8158,,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV RHODE ISL,GRAD SCH OCEANOG,MARINE ECOSYST RES LAB,NARRAGANSETT,RI 02882",,,,1994-10-14,WOS:A1994PR74500004,,,,,

In order to assess the impact of additional mortalities on birds, both the number of birds killed and their ability to sustain those deaths must be estimated. Niel and Lebreton [Niel, C., Lebreton, J.-D., 2005. Using demographic invariants to detect overharvested bird populations from incomplete data. Conservation Biology 19, 826-835] applied a simple decision rule [Wade, P.R., 1998. Calculating limits to the allowable human-caused mortality of cetaceans and pinnipeds. Marine Mammal Science 14, 1-37] to estimate the level of additional human-caused mortality or potential biological removal (PBR) that can be sustained for bird species given only (1) estimates of the population size, adult survival, and age at first breeding, and (2) the current population status and management goals. We provide guidelines for appropriate use of the method and case studies comparing results from this method to other approaches. Particular focus is placed on applying the method to Procellariiformes. PBR limits may then be set without a population model and when monitoring levels are minimal, and in a computationally straightforward manner. While this approach has many advantages, there are limitations. The PBR rule was initially developed for cetaceans and pinnipeds and there have been no adaptations for the unique biology of birds which may need further consideration. Additionally, because this is a simplifying method that ignores differences in life stages, it may not be appropriate for very small populations or for those listed as 'critically endangered', and further work is needed for situations where mortalities have large gender or age bias.

A program was initiated in 1999 to design and assemble a station which will monitor physical and chemical parameters of the sea water and sea-floor sediments on a more-or-less continuous basis over an extended period of time. It is planned that an operational station will be installed in at least a thousand meters of water by 2004.The heart of the station will be a net of vertical arrays of sensors. Each array will occupy the lower portion of the water column and a hole bored into the sea floor. Sensors will include hydrophones to record compression waves, thermistors to measure temperature within the water and the sediment, and optic fibers connected to an optical spectrometer to identify and quantify hydrocarbon gases. The lowermost sensor of each array will be a three-component accelerometer pushed into the sediments at the bottom of the hole to record compression and shear waves.Peripheral sensors will include a sea-floor positioning system and an acoustic doppler current profiler. Also, if sufficient electrical power is available, several video systems with pan and tilt capability will be installed. The video images would be posted on a web site in near-to-real time and made available for educational and public outreach purposes.Retrieving the huge volume of data that the station will produce is not a trivial problem. The most likely scenario is that, at first, the data will be recorded on the sea floor and periodically downloaded by an underwater vehicle. Eventually, the station will be connected via optic fiber to a surface structure, such as an oil platform, and the data transmitted in near-to-real time to a shore facility at the Stennis Space Center.The station will initiate collection of a data base for assessing and modeling stability of the sea floor and factors associated with the formation and dissociation of gas hydrates. This data base will also be available for planning hydrate exploration and, eventually, for analyzing the impact of producing hydrates from the ocean floor. It will be possible to expand the capabilities of the station to include biological monitoring. This would allow the study of chemosynthetic communities and their potential as a source for natural products/drug discoveries as well as an assessment of their environmental health and interactions with geologic processes.",,,,,11th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE-2001)11th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE-2001),"JUN 17-22, 2001JUN 17-22, 2001","Int Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers; Canadian Assoc Petr Producers; Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Engn Mech Div; Korea Comm Ocean Resources & Engn; Canadian Soc Civil Engineers, Engn Mech Div; Chinese Soc Ocean Engineers; Chinese Soc Naval Architects & Marine Engineers; Chinese Soc Theoret & Appl Mech; Russian Acad Sci; Singapore Struct Steel Soc; Norwegian Petr Soc; Inst Engineers Australia; Kansai Soc Naval Architects; IRO; Tech Res Ctr Finland; Soc Mat Sci; Offshore Engn Soc; Ukraine Soc Mech Engineers; IFREMER; Scott Polar Res Inst; Inst Engineers Indones; Brazilian Soc Naval Architects & Marine Engineers; Korean Soc Civil EngineersInt Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers; Canadian Assoc Petr Producers; Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Engn Mech Div; Korea Comm Ocean Resources & Engn; Canadian Soc Civil Engineers, Engn Mech Div; Chinese Soc Ocean Engineers; Chinese Soc Naval Architects & Marine Engineers; Chinese Soc Theoret & Appl Mech; Russian Acad Sci; Singapore Struct Steel Soc; Norwegian Petr Soc; Inst Engineers Australia; Kansai Soc Naval Architects; IRO; Tech Res Ctr Finland; Soc Mat Sci; Offshore Engn Soc; Ukraine Soc Mech Engineers; IFREMER; Scott Polar Res Inst; Inst Engineers Indones; Brazilian Soc Naval Architects & Marine Engineers; Korean Soc Civil Engineers","STAVANGER, NORWAYSTAVANGER, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1098-6189,,1-880653-52-4,,,,,,,,,"Univ Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA",,,,2001-01-01,WOS:000171593000073,,,,,

The Offshore Wind Pilot Project was proposed by Principle Power, Inc, in May 2013. The proposed lease request is approximately 15 nautical miles offshore Coos Bay, Oregon with an area of approximately 15 square miles. The project would consist of five 6.0 megawatt (MW) wind turbine generators mounted on floating foundations, anchored to the seafloor in 1,200 to 1,600 feet water depth. This USGS study is funded by BOEM to acquire data and generate a CMECS habitat map in the area surrounding the Pilot Project site. Operations were conducted using the USGS R/V Parke Snavely equipped with a Reson 7111 multibeam sonar mounted on starboard side pole and a towed high definition video sled. Sonar data were acquired using Reson PDS 2000 software. Horizontal positions for navigation and data collection were determined by using a POS M/V V5 operating in Differential GPS (DGPS) mode. The horizontal datum was Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 10 North and the vertical datum was MLLW. The survey was conducted using 12 hour day operations out of Charleston Harbor near Coos Bay, Oregon. The cruise plan consisted of 23 days on site split between sonar mapping and video ground truth surveying. Activities parsed out to nine days of sonar mapping, three days of video surveying, eight days of no operations due to weather, and three days mobilizing and demobilizing. Typically the Snavely would transit out to the survey area in an hour at a speed of 20 knots. Multibeam sonar operations were conducted on north or south oriented tracklines at a speed of 4 to 5 knots depending on sea state. The optimal heading for sonar operations is isobath parallel. Video operations were conducted by deploying up drift of a target and drifting over it at speeds of 1 knot or less.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-06-04,DRCI:DATA2019077015700522,,,,,

While microbial biomass decreased with sediment depth, viable microbes (RNA and PLFA) were present all through the profiles. The vertical stratification patterns of the bacterial and archaeal communities resembled those in marine sediments with well-characterized groups (e.g. Methanomicrobia, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes) dominating in the surface sediment and being replaced by poorly-known groups (e.g. Bathyarchaeota, Aminicenantes and Caldiserica) in the deeper layers. The results also suggested that, similar to marine systems, the deep bacterial and archaeal communities were predominantly assembled by selective survival of taxa able to persist in the low energy conditions. Methanotrophs were rare, further corroborating the role of these methanogen-rich sediments as important methane emitters.

The transport processes are driven by the sedimentary load and induced overpressure gradients, controlled by sediment permeability. In order to accurately model the resulting fluid flow profile, the decrease of sediment permeability during hydrate precipitation has to be taken into account, which affects both the transport of solutes and sediment compaction. In this paper, we investigate how total hydrate abundance is affected by regions of low permeability which deflect the flow field in their vicinity. For this purpose, a two-dimensional numerical hydrate system model was set up which permits to quantify this effect in scenarios where changes in water depth cause lateral variations of the thickness of the hydrate stability field, as well as of hydrate saturation and sediment permeability. The microscopic structure of gas hydrate crystals in the host sediment matrix defines the evolution of the permeability reduction during hydrate formation. Grain-coating precipitates have a stronger tendency to clog flow paths through pore throats than do pore-filling precipitates. Our results clearly show that these pore-scale processes affect the large-scale flow field and hydrate abundance. The sensitivity depends on the model geometry and, for a 5A degrees slope of the seafloor, 4.1% relative difference is predicted for the hydrate saturation according to different porosity-permeability relationships.",,,,,9th International Conference on Gas in Marine Sediments9th International Conference on Gas in Marine Sediments,"SEP 15-19, 2008SEP 15-19, 2008",,"Univ Bremen, Bremen, GERMANYUniv Bremen, Bremen, GERMANY",5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,0276-0460,1432-1157,,,,,,,,,,"Jacobs Univ Bremen, D-28209 Bremen, Germany",,,,2010-06-01,WOS:000277941800012,,,,,

The Caspian Sea also receives substantial amounts of runoff from agricultural and municipal sources, containing nutrients that have caused eutrophication and subsequent hypoxia in the deep, cold waters. The effect of decreasing oxygen saturation and cold temperatures on oil hydrocarbon biodegradation by a microbial community is not well characterized. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of oxic and anoxic conditions on oil hydrocarbon biodegradation at cold temperatures by microbial communities derived from the Caspian Sea. Water samples were collected from the Caspian Sea for study in experimental microcosms. Major taxonomic orders observed in the ambient water samples included Flavobacteriales, Actinomycetales, and Oceanospirillales. Microcosms were inoculated with microbial communities from the deepest waters and amended with oil hydrocarbons for 17 days. Hydrocarbon degradation and shifts in microbial community structure were measured. Surprisingly, oil hydrocarbon biodegradation under anoxic conditions exceeded that under oxic conditions; this was particularly evident in the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons. Important microbial taxa associated with the anoxic microcosms included known oil degraders such as Oceanospirillaceae. This study provides knowledge about the ambient community structure of the Caspian Sea, which serves as an important reference point for future studies.

This work has been undertaken on behalf of The Offshore Wind Strategic Monitoring Research Forum (OWSMRF) (https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/owsmrf/) MRF is an industry-led collaborative forum that aims to identify and develop research to fill critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of the impact of offshore wind development on the marine environment. OWSMRF stakeholders identified cumulative impacts on kittiwakes as the priority need for improving understanding of offshore windfarm environmental impacts. Improving understanding of connectivity between OWF and SPA populations was identified as one of the key knowledge gaps in this area (the other two being: reducing uncertainty around estimates of collision mortality and developing a tool to facilitate cumulative effects assessment). JNCC organised an expert workshop to help understand what research might help to reduce uncertainty in this connectivity. This report provides a summary of existing, relevant, research and evidence, and research opportunities that were discussed during the workshop. The research opportunities (ROs) suggested as potentially very useful and discussed during the workshop are: RO2.1: extending a draft apportioning tool that has been developed for Scottish waters (by CEH and RSPB, on behalf of Marine Scotland) into UK waters. This tool uses species distribution predictions based on GPS tracking data presented in Wakefield et al. (2017) to provide quantitative apportioning of birds seen within a windfarm footprint to source colonies (for four species including kittiwake). This project would use the code developed for the existing (Scottish waters) tool and the UK-wide work of Wakefield et al. (2017) to extend the tool across UK waters. RO2.2: macro-analysis of existing data to identify spatial and temporal patterns in migration movements. This project uses a collation of currently available data and products from various sources (both at-sea and tracking data types, and distribution map products). These data would be analysed to assess broad latitudinal movements and timings of migration, to indicate the extent at which cumulatively, kittiwakes are interacting with multiple windfarm zones and footprints during different seasons. RO2.3: strategic (non-GPS) tracking feasibility study. This project would explore the feasibility of, and practicalities around, using smaller lighter and less expensive means of tracking than GPS devices. This would include consideration of VHF radio tracking, Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) devices and/or colour ringing. If deployed at scale across the UK, this would provide information on linkages between multiple wind farms and colonies (in similar way to existing GPS tagging studies, but over a longer time period, covering many more individuals, at much larger spatial scale, and including the non-breeding season) and on linkages between colonies over time (e.g. do kittiwakes move from one colony to another across years). This RO would also provide synergies with improved understanding of windfarm-induced mortality, and demographic rates for estimating population impacts of windfarm effects. RO2.4: catching kittiwakes at sea; proof of concept and guidance. This project is a combination of desk-based and at-sea studies which would explore approaches and methods for catching kittiwakes at sea, sampling/device attachment/data collection options, potential biases and other issues to be aware of. It would combine a literature review and contacting seabird catching experts to learn lessons, and a trial of catching kittiwakes at sea to test lessons and assumptions, and production of guidance for catching of kittiwakes at sea for data collection/device attachment purposes. This would facilitate a more windfarm focussed approach to collection of movement/linkage data, leading to efficiencies and reduced uncertainty in linking windfarm effects to relevant populations. RO2.5: citizen science to provide age structure information of kittiwakes, both along the coast and at sea. This RO would use citizen science to improve evidence for assessing what proportion of birds seen at a windfarm footprint (and/or potentially affected by a windfarm) are adults. This would allow potential windfarm effects to not only be apportioned to the appropriate population (e.g. colony) but also to the appropriate age-class within each population. Several of these research opportunities would complement each other, and combined, could lead to real change in the way windfarm effects are apportioned to colonies and populations, and significantly reduce uncertainty in assessments of cumulative impacts on kittiwake from offshore windfarm deployment.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-11-21,ZOOREC:ZOOR15712083124,,,,,

In an attempt to keep the oil submerged, massive quantities of the chemical dispersant Corexit 9500 were deployed 1522 m deep at the gushing riser pipe of the Macondo prospects wellhead. Understanding the effectiveness of this unprecedented subsea dispersant injection (SSDI) is critical because deep-water drilling is increasing worldwide. Here we use the comprehensive BP Gulf Science Data (GSD) to quantify petroleum dynamics throughout the 87-day long blowout. The spatio-temporal distribution of petroleum hydrocarbons revealed consistent higher concentrations at the sea surface and in a deep intrusion below 1000 m. The relative importance of these two layers depended on the hydrocarbon mass fractions as expected from their partitioning along temperature and pressure changes. Further, analyses of water column polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) of GSD extensively sampled within a 10-km radius of the blowout source demonstrated that substantial amounts of oil continued to surface near the response site, with no significant effect of SSDI volume on PAH vertical distribution and concentration. The turbulent energy associated with the spewing of gas-saturated oil at the deep-sea blowout may have minimized the effectiveness of the SSDI response approach. Given the potential for toxic chemical dispersants to cause environmental damage by increasing oil bioavailability and toxicity while suppressing its biodegradation, unrestricted SSDI application in response to deep-sea blowout is highly questionable.

Many north-west European countries who have a high reliance on coastal energy infrastructure have a high awareness of sea-level rise and plan for future change.

The authors recorded this specimen for Sumatra, Riau (from 2004 Riau and Riau Islands are two different provinces of Sumatra). The authors remarked that the singleton was said to be collected on an offshore oil rig near Bunguran but they believed that the specimen originated on Bali or Java and was apparently transported by a ship before being captured.

There is also no shipping route known from Bali passing the South China Sea and Bunguran, which means that a transport by ship seems rather unlikely.

The fastest increasing wind speed trends are observed in the Ionian, the N Tyrrhenian and N Adriatic Seas, the eastern part of the Algerian Basin up to Balearic Isl. and the western part of the S Levantine Basin while the fastest decreasing ones are observed offshore Monaco, the central Aegean and the E Alboran Seas and the N Levantine Basin.

In an attempt to keep the oil submerged, massive quantities of the chemical dispersant Corexit 9500 were deployed 1522 m deep at the gushing riser pipe of the Macondo prospects wellhead. Understanding the effectiveness of this unprecedented subsea dispersant injection (SSDI) is critical because deep-water drilling is increasing worldwide. Here we use the comprehensive BP Gulf Science Data (GSD) to quantify petroleum dynamics throughout the 87-day long blowout. The spatio-temporal distribution of petroleum hydrocarbons revealed consistent higher concentrations at the sea surface and in a deep intrusion below 1000 m. The relative importance of these two layers depended on the hydrocarbon mass fractions as expected from their partitioning along temperature and pressure changes. Further, analyses of water column polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) of GSD extensively sampled within a 10-km radius of the blowout source demonstrated that substantial amounts of oil continued to surface near the response site, with no significant effect of SSDI volume on PAH vertical distribution and concentration. The turbulent energy associated with the spewing of gas-saturated oil at the deep-sea blowout may have minimized the effectiveness of the SSDI response approach. Given the potential for toxic chemical dispersants to cause environmental damage by increasing oil bioavailability and toxicity while suppressing its biodegradation, unrestricted SSDI application in response to deep-sea blowout is highly questionable. More efforts are required to inform response plans in future oil spills. Copyright: CC BY 4.0",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-04-24,DRCI:DATA2019061015438653,,,,,

A terrestrial 3D laser scanner was used to acquire data of the sediment surface around the foundation structure. Tests have been conducted systematically varying from wave- to current-dominated conditions. Different volume analyzing methods are introduced, which can be related for any offshore or coastal structure to disclose physical processes in complex erosion patterns. Empirical formulations are proposed for the quantification of spatially eroded sediment volumes and scour depths in the near-field and vicinity of the structure. Findings from the present study agree well with in-situ data stemming from the field. Contrasting spatial erosion development between experimental and in-situ data determines a stable maximum of erosion intensity at a distance of 1.25 A, 1.25 times the structure's footprint A, as well as a global scour extent of 2.1-2.7 A within the present study and about 2.7-2.8 A from the field.

In April 2010 the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon (DWH) offshore oil rig exploded, releasing an estimated 760 million liters of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. This study examines the potential effects of oil spill exposure on coral larvae of the Florida Keys. Larvae of the brooding coral, Porites astreoides, and the broadcast spawning coral, Montastraea faveolata, were exposed to multiple concentrations of BP Horizon source oil (crude, weathered and WAF), oil in combination with the dispersant Corexit (R) 9500 (CEWAF), and dispersant alone, and analyzed for behavior, settlement, and survival. Settlement and survival of P. astreoides and M. faveolata larvae decreased with increasing concentrations of WAF, CEWAF and Corexit (R) 9500, however the degree of the response varied by species and solution. P. astreoides larvae experienced decreased settlement and survival following exposure to 0.62 ppm source oil, while M. faveolata larvae were negatively impacted by 0.65, 1.34 and 1.5 ppm, suggesting that P. astreoides larvae may be more tolerant to WAF exposure than M. faveolata larvae. Exposure to medium and high concentrations of CEWAF (4.28/18.56 and 30.99/35.76 ppm) and dispersant Corexit (R) 9500 (50 and 100 ppm), significantly decreased larval settlement and survival for both species. Furthermore, exposure to Corexit (R) 9500 resulted in settlement failure and complete larval mortality after exposure to 50 and 100 ppm for M. faveolata and 100 ppm for P. astreoides. These results indicate that exposure of coral larvae to oil spill related contaminants, particularly the dispersant Corexit (R) 9500, has the potential to negatively impact coral settlement and survival, thereby affecting the resilience and recovery of coral reefs following exposure to oil and dispersants.",,,,,,,,,120,1,0,0,93,0,147,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Mote Marine Lab, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA",,,,2013-01-09,WOS:000313551500001,23326298,,,,

Some of this oil was mechanically or chemically dispersed before reaching the shore. With a set of laboratory-column experiments we show that the addition of chemical dispersants (Corexit 9500A) increases the mobility of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in saturated permeable sediments by up to two orders of magnitude. Distribution and concentrations of PAHs, measured in the solid phase and effluent water of the columns using GC/MS, revealed that the mobility of the PAHs depended on their hydrophobicity and was species specific also in the presence of dispersant. Deepest penetration was observed for acenaphthylene and phenanthrene. Flushing of the columns with seawater after percolation of the oiled water resulted in enhanced movement by remobilization of retained PAHs. An in-situ benthic chamber experiment demonstrated that aromatic hydrocarbons are transported into permeable sublittoral sediment, emphasizing the relevance of our laboratory column experiments in natural settings. We conclude that the addition of dispersants permits crude oil components to penetrate faster and deeper into permeable saturated sands, where anaerobic conditions may slow degradation of these compounds, thus extending the persistence of potentially harmful PAHs in the marine environment. Application of dispersants in nearshore oil spills should take into account enhanced penetration depths into saturated sands as this may entail potential threats to the groundwater.",,,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,24,0,48,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USAUniv Utrecht, Dept Earth Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands",,,,2013-01-16,WOS:000311885800083,23209777,,,,

Once oil reached the surface, changes in overall chemical composition occurred due to volatilization of the smaller carbon chain compounds as the oil was transported onshore by winds and currents. In this study, the toxic effects of both fresh and weathered crude oil on denitrification rates of coastal marsh soil were determined using soil samples collected from an unimpacted coastal marsh site proximal to areas that were oiled in Barataria Bay, LA. The 1:10 ratio of crude oil:field moist soil fully coated the soil surface mimicking a heavy oiling scenario. Potential denitrification rates at the 1:10 ratio, for weathered crude oil, were 46 +/- 18.4% of the control immediately after exposure and 62 +/- 8.0% of the control following a two week incubation period, suggesting some adaptation of the denitrifying microbial consortium over time. Denitrification rates of soil exposed to fresh crude oil were 51.5 +/- 5.3% of the control after immediate exposure and significantly lower at 10.9 +/- 1.1% after a 2 week exposure period. Results suggest that fresh crude oil has the potential to more severely impact the important marsh soil process of denitrification following longer term exposure. Future studies should focus on longer-term denitrification as well as changes in the microbial consortia in response to oil exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While the cost of generated energy has just been reduced to £100/MWhr for offshore wind in the UK (4 years ahead of government schedule) deployment further offshore will increase both the capital and operational & maintenance (O&M) costs. in China, onshore wind power is severely curtailed due to crowded transmission corridors. Exploitation of offshore wind would better match the population distribution in China, and so hence there is a strong motivation to exploit this ORE. In order accelerate this development, new technologies are desperately needed to improve the performance in terms of cost, efficiency and reliability (availability). In addition to offshore wind, other forms of marine renewable energy will also play indispensable roles in the future renewable energy mix. Because these technologies are less mature, this development involves even higher risks. As yet none of the wave energy generation companies have shown to be commercially viable without economic support mechanisms. Recognising the high risks involved and the development work that is urgently needed in the industry, this project aims to carry out fundamental modelling and validating work that will lead to the capability of virtual prototyping. Such a capability will significantly accelerate and de-risk the development work in industry. Complementary expertise in the two countries are combined to address the requirements of overall system performance from ORE devices (wind and wave) to grid, and focuses on the critical technical aspects that will dictate the design decisions. This will be achieved through multiple scale (dimensional and time-wise) and multiple resolution modelling, taking into account the specifications and utilisation of materials and components in the designed systems subject to optimal control. The modelling will cover the manufacturability of the designs and will consider environmental constraints including impact on sea life in different locations. These will be important as ORE development is scaled up in the future. The outcome of research will be demonstrated through a series of case studies including both systems for large wind farms and wave arrays, and also small scale devices supplying energy to off-grid islands.The project members have long track records in modelling and design of components in wind and marine renewable systems.

New techniques that employ radar to activate deterrents only when birds are approaching a spill offer the potential to deter birds with greater and lasting efficacy. We summarize the findings of three recent studies of radar-activated bird deterrents at contaminated inland ponds and develop hypothetical scenarios for implementing such a system at marine oil spills. In open-water areas and inaccessible coastlines, boats may act as platforms for both radar and cannon deterrents. In coastal areas, networks of land-based radar and floating cannon platforms could be used. We discuss the importance of coupling knowledge on bird distributions and spill risk for effective planning and implementation of deterrents in oil spill response and then address some limitations of the radar-based system for oil spill responses.

The ASPECT aircraft was released from service on August 9, 2010 after having flown over 75 missions that included over 250 hours of flight operation. ASPECT's initial mission responsibility was to provide air quality monitoring (i.e., identification of vapor species) during various oil burning operations. The ASPECT airborne wide-area infrared remote sensing spectral data was used to evaluate the hazard potential of vapors being produced from open water oil burns near the Deepwater Horizon rig site. Other significant remote sensing data products and innovations included the development of an advanced capability to correctly identify, locate, characterize, and quantify surface oil that could reach beaches and wetland areas.

Marine planning encompasses a broad array of activities that take place in and affect large marine ecosystems, making it an ideal tool for evaluating wave energy resource use conflicts. In this study, we used a spatially explicit, open source decision support tool to evaluate wave energy facility development off the U.S. west coast. We then used this output to identify potential conflicts between wave energy facilities and the existing marine uses in the context of marine planning. We found that regions with the highest wave energy potential were distant from major cities and that infrastructure limitations (cable landing sites) restrict integration with the existing power grids. We also identified multiple potential conflicts, including commercial fishing, shipping and transportation, and marine conservation areas. While wave energy generation facilities may be economically viable, we must also incorporate costs associated with conflicts that arise with the existing marine uses.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,0,6,,,0892-0753,1521-0421,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA",,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000386337200009,,,,,

Coastal and certain offshore waters of Southwest Greenland constitute internationally important wintering areas for seabirds and bird strikes are reported as a problem when ves- sels navigate in icy waters using powerful searchlight. In this study a se- lection of navy vessels, cargo vessels and trawlers reported on incidents of bird strikes using pre-supplied forms. Among 19 vessels initially included in the study, 10 vessels reported a total of 41 incidents of bird strikes over a period of two winters (Oct.- Mar., 2006-08; for two vessels also the winter 08/09). Most bird strikes occurred less than 4 km from land (76% events, 93% birds), but in two cases as far offshore as 205 km and 422 km. The mean number of birds ([plus or minus]S.E.) reported killed was 11.5 [plus or minus] 3.1 birds/incident, with 88 birds re- ported as the highest number. All bird strikes occurred between 4 p.m. and 5 a.m. and significantly more birds were killed when visibility was poor (snow) rather than moderate or good. The species reported were common eider (95%), king eider (3%), long-tailed duck (1%), murres (<1%) and black guillemot (<1%). In 17% of the incidents vessels re- ported about damaged navigation or communication equipment due to avian collisions. Despite huge variation in the reporting of bird strikes among vessels, this study confirms that light-induced bird strike incidents occur on a regular basis in Southwest Greenland during winter, especially in coastal areas when visibility is poor. A crude estimate for the annual number of birds killed in Southwest Greenland sum up to app. 2.000 individuals; however, additional studies are needed to verify the level of this esti- mate. It is clear though, that common eider is the main species of con- cern, accounting for 95% of the birds reported. To reduce the number of bird strike incidents I recommend vessels to avoid known high-risk areas at night when visibility is poor, to shield as much light as possible towards the sky, to switch off light when not used and I recommend studies that investigate alternative ice lookout tech- niques, e.g., filtering out certain wavelengths or combining modified search light with image enhancing technology.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1397-3657,,,,,,,,,,,"National Environmental Research Institute, Aarhus University, Greenland Institute of Natural Resources",,,,2010-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14702019064,,,,,

To assist this effort in Rhode Island, benthic habitat classification maps were developed for two sites in offshore waters being considered for wind turbine installation. Maps characterizing and representing the distribution and extent of benthic habitats are valuable tools for improving understanding of ecosystem patterns and processes, and promoting scientifically-sound management decisions. This project presented the opportunity to conduct a comparison of the methodologies and resulting map outputs of two classification approaches, top-down and bottom-up in the two study areas.This comparison was undertaken to improve understanding of mapping methodologies and their applicability, including the bottom-up approach in offshore environments where data density tends to be lower, as well as to provide case studies for scientists and managers to consider for their own areas of interest. Such case studies can offer guidance for future work for assessing methodologies and translating them to other areas.The traditional top-down mapping approach identifies biological community patterns based on communities occurring within geologically defined habitat map units, under the concept that geologic environments contain distinct biological assemblages. Alternatively, the bottom-up approach aims to establish habitat map units centered on biological similarity and then uses statistics to identify relationships with associated environmental parameters and determine habitat boundaries. When applied to the two study areas, both mapping approaches produced habitat classes with distinct macrofaunal assemblages and each established statistically strong and significant biotic abiotic relationships with geologic features, sediment characteristics, water depth, and/or habitat heterogeneity over various spatial scales. The approaches were also able to integrate various data at differing spatial resolutions. The classification outputs exhibited similar results, including the number of habitat classes generated, the number of species defining the classes, the level of distinction of the biological communities, and dominance by tube-building amphipods. These results indicate that both approaches are able to discern a comparable degree of habitat variability and produce cohesive macrofaunal assemblages. The mapping approaches identify broadly similar benthic habitats at the two study sites and methods were able to distinguish the differing levels of heterogeneity between them.The top-down approach to habitat classification was faster and simpler to accomplish with the data available in this study when compared to the bottom-up approach. Additionally, the top-down approach generated full-coverage habitat classes that are clearly delineated and can easily be interpreted by the map user, which is desirable from a management perspective for providing a more complete assessment of the areas of interest. However, a higher level of biological variability was noted in some of the habitat classes created, indicating that the biological communities present in this area are influenced by factors not captured in the broad-scale geological habitat units used in this approach.The bottom-up approach was valuable in its ability to more clearly define macrofaunal assemblages among habitats, discern finer-scale habitat characteristics, and directly assess the degree of macrofaunal assemblage variability captured by the environmental parameters. From a user perspective, the map is more complex, which may be perceived as a limitation, though likely reflects natural gradations in habitat structure and likely presents a more ecologically realistic portrayal of the study areas. Though more comprehensive, the bottom-up approach in this study was limited by the reliance on full-coverage data to create full-coverage habitat classes. Such classes could only be developed when sediment data was excluded, since this point-sample dataset could not be interpolated due to high spatial heterogeneity of the study areas. Given a higher density of bottom samples, this issue could be rectified.While the top-down approach was more appropriate for this study, both approaches were found to be suitable for mapping and classifying benthic habitats. In the United States, objectives for mapping and classification for renewable energy development have not been well established. Therefore, at this time, the best-suited approach primarily depends on mapping objectives, resource availability, data quality and coverage, and geographical location, as these factors impact the types of data included, the analyses and modeling that can be performed, and the biotic-abiotic relationships identified.

Model results show that the fast boundary outflow from Asia to the western Pacific is largely restricted to the middle latitudes, and the maximum outflow fluxes are in the lower free atmosphere (3-6 km) north of 25degreesN. Simulations with and without biomass burning emissions are conducted to quantify the impacts of biomass burning on tropospheric concentrations of CO and O-3. Biomass burning is found to contribute more than 50% of the CO concentrations and up to 40% of the O-3 concentrations in the boundary layer over the major source regions.

This area is subject to chronic natural oil seepage and spillage from oil production activities. Multivariate analysis was used to define those environmental variables which best explained community composition. The deeper sites were impoverished due to the development of anoxia below a pycnocline which formed during the wet season. Abundance/biomass comparison (ABC) plots indicated that macrobenthic communities near an oil refinery were grossly to moderately stressed while those close to the Trinidad Pitch Lake, one of the largest natural oil seeps in the world, were not. Taxonomic aggregation of the species data to family level resulted in little loss of information in the multivariate analyses and apparently improved the ability of ABC curves to discriminate pollution. Comparisons of the severity of community degradation at these sites using a phylum-level meta-analysis of 'production' were compatible with NE Atlantic data, which augurs well for the more global applicability of this approach. A feature of the Trinidad samples is that they all separate along the upper edge of the meta-analysis 'wedge', due mainly to their higher average proportion of Crustaced relative to Echinodermata and Mollusca.

In contrast, DMS levels, which varied dramatically over short distances, showed no significant correlations with any single variable for the full, high-resolution data set. However, when measurements were binned to a much coarser spatial resolution, we found a linear relationship between surface DMS and the chlorophyll/mixed layer depth ratio. The slope of this relationship differed significantly from that previously derived from open ocean data.

Possessing rich and diversified renewable energy resources within its territory encouraged the Moroccan government to make ambitious plans to integrate renewable energy resources into its national grid on a big scale, 42% of its energy generating capacity from renewables by 2020, and 52% by 2030. This paper provides a first assessment of the offshore energy potential available near the coastline of Morocco. After a brief description of operations of offshore wind, tidal and wave power, a first order assessment of their potential is presented and discussed. This study shows that important offshore wind resources are available throughout the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coast of Morocco. This resource peaks between the regions of Al Jadida and Agadir, reaching a speed of 9_m/s. The bulk of the offshore resources are located at the Atlantic coastline of the country. Tidal stream resources are concentrated at the region of Tangier, where tidal speed is up to 1.9_m/s potentially producing 1.58_kW/m(2). Oualidia lagoon was studied and found to be capable of producing more than 0.5_MW of electricity if a tidal barrage exploits 10% of its surface.

Marine phytoplankton play a key role in aggregate formation through the production of extracellular polymeric materials (EPS), an important step in the biological carbon pump. This study examined the impacts of oil and dispersants on the composition and physiology of natural marine phytoplankton communities from the Gulf of Mexico during a 72-hour mesocosm experiment and consequences to carbon export. The communities were treated using the water accommodated fraction (WAF) of oil, which was produced by adding Macondo surrogate oil to natural seawater and mixed for 24 h in the dark. A chemically enhanced WAF (CEWAF) was made in a similar manner, but using a mixture of oil and the dispersant Corexit in a 20:1 ratio as well as a diluted CEWAF (DCEWAF). Phytoplankton communities exposed to WAF showed no significant changes in PSII quantum yield ((Fv)/F-m) or electron transfer rates (ETRmax) compared to Control communities. In contrast, both F-v/F-m and ETRmax declined rapidly in communities treated with either CEWAF or DCEWAF. Analysis of other photophysiological parameters showed that photosystem II (PSII) antenna size and PSII connectivity factor were not altered by exposure to DCEWAF, suggesting that processes downstream of PSII were affected. The eukaryote community composition in each experimental tank was characterized at the end of the 72 h exposure time using 18S rRNA sequencing. Diatoms dominated the communities in both the control and WAF treatments (52 and 56% relative abundance respectively), while in CEWAF and DCEWAF treatments were dominated by heterotrophic Euglenozoa (51 and 84% respectively). Diatoms made up the largest relative contribution to the autotrophic eukaryote community in all treatments. EPS concentration was four times higher in CEWAF tanks compared to other treatments. Changes in particle size distributions (a proxy for aggregates) over time indicated that a higher degree of particle aggregation occurred in both the CEWAF and DCEWAF treatments than the WAF or Controls. Our results demonstrate that chemically dispersed oil has more negative impacts on photophysiology, phytoplankton community structure and aggregation dynamics than oil alone, with potential implications for export processes that affect the distribution and turnover of carbon and oil in the water column.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,20,0,24,,,0166-445X,1879-1514,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USAMt Allison Univ, Environm Sci Dept, Sackville, NB, CanadaTexas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Sci, Galveston, TX 77553 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAMt Allison Univ, Math & Comp Sci Dept, Sackville, NB, CanadaTexas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,,,2019-02-15,WOS:000457506000005,30448744,,,,

The ESSA algorithm is verified using twenty-three benchmark test functions and compared with the original SSA algorithm and other algorithms. The statistical analysis of the obtained results revealed that the ESSA algorithm is significantly improved and the convergence curves showed the fast convergence to the best solution.

The simulation results using PSCAD/EMTDC proved that the produced power when using ESSA is higher than when using SSA which mean higher efficiency and lower cost.",,,,,,,,,128,18,0,0,5,0,143,,,0952-1976,1873-6769,,,,,,,,,,"King Saud Univ, Fac Engn, Elect Engn Dept, Riyadh 11421, Saudi ArabiaAin Shams Univ, Fac Engn, Elect Power & Machines Dept, Cairo 11517, Egypt",,,,2019-04-22,WOS:000464089700007,,,,,

A framework for risk assessment of multi-use at sea,,,,,,,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,,,,184,,,,,,105030,,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.105030,,,,,,,Article,FEB 1 2020,2020,"By 2050 the world population is expected to reach 10 billion people. This population needs food, water and energy. Increasingly, opportunities are sought out at sea to accommodate these needs. As there is already competition for space, especially in the near-shore, opportunities for multi-use, including the combination of, for example, food and energy production in a single location, are sought. One issue that needs to be addressed to allow for multi-use at sea is safety. Existing frameworks for (marine) risk assessment tend to be rather sector specific and, although existing models and frameworks for risk analysis provide useful elements for an integrated analysis, none of the approaches fully caters for the need of having a framework based on a cyclical process of stakeholder input in all steps of the process of risk identification, risk management and risk evaluation and communication, identifying actions to be taken and providing tools useful in each of the steps, while integrating the three perspectives of maritime safety, food (and feed) safety, and environmental impact assessment and the different perspectives of the actors involved. This study developed a common framework for the risk assessment of multi-use at sea, consisting of six steps (Exploring, Understanding, Appraising, Deciding, Implementing and Evaluating & Communication). The framework encompasses and integrates an analysis of food and feed safety aspects, the safety of people and equipment, and environmental safety aspects. For each step, actions are defined, tools that can be of help to stakeholders are presented, and stakeholder participation measures are described. The framework is iterative and dynamic in its nature; with constant communication and evaluation of progress, decisions can be taken to either take a step forward or back. The framework is developed to assist operators and producers, policymakers, and other stakeholders in assessing and managing risks of multi-use at sea.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,0,17,,,0964-5691,1873-524X,,,,,,,,,,"Wageningen Marine Res, Wageningen, NetherlandsWageningen Econ Res, Wageningen, NetherlandsWageningen Food Safety Res, Wageningen, NetherlandsWageningen Environm Res, Wageningen, Netherlands",,,,2020-02-25,WOS:000508756500022,,,,,

Development and expansion of Canada's offshore oil and gas reserves has led to concerns over the potential long-term impacts of produced water discharges to the ocean. To examine this emerging environmental issue at a regional scale, an integrated risk assessment approach was developed in this study based on the princeton ocean model (POM), a random walk (RW) and Monte Carlo simulation. The use of water quality standards arrayed in a Monte Carlo design in the developed approach has served to reflect uncertainties and quantify environmental risks associated with produced water discharge. The model was validated against field data from a platform operating off Canada's east coast, demonstrating its usefulness in supporting effective management of future produced water discharge.

Among long distance avian migrants, soaring birds are particularly dependent on wind and updrafts to help them complete their journeys. This review focuses on the behavioral adaptations of migratory soaring birds at various scales with regard to these atmospheric phenomena. Soaring landbirds and soaring seabirds have evolved morphological characteristics that make them specialists in soaring flight, thus enabling them to reduce the costs of migration significantly. We introduce the flight strategies of each group and discuss how migratory routes, flight characteristics, and onset and stopover decisions are all adjusted in relation to atmospheric conditions best suited for soaring. In addition, we discuss briefly how this strong dependence on atmospheric conditions makes soaring birds vulnerable to anthropogenic threats, such as wind energy development and climate change.",,,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,20,0,30,,,1347-0558,,,,,,,,,,,"Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries & Environm Sci, Bunkyo Machi 1-14, Nagasaki 8528521, Japan",,,,2017-03-29,WOS:000395099700002,,,,,

This paper examines respiratory and circulatory adaptations for air breathing in these land crabs. Respiratory specializations include modification of gas exchange structures for air breathing (gills and elaborated branchial chamber linings), ventilatory mechanisms permitting effective air pumping, an elevated hemolymph oxygen capacity, and a primarily CO2- rather than O2-sensitive ventilatory control system. The qualitative aspects of hemolymph oxygen transport and metabolic rate are apparently unchanged from that of marine crabs. While the basic cardiovascular morphology of land crabs appears similar to that of marine forms, there is considerable elaboration of the vasculature of the branchial chamber lining, which in some species includes a unique double portal system. Cardiac output is lower in land crabs (probably related to their higher hemolymph O2 capacity), but insufficient data on hemolymph pressures prevent comparisons with marine forms. In general, land crabs have modified (sometimes extensively) existing structures and processes found in their marine relatives rather than evolving structures for terrestrial life de novo. Accordingly, land crabs present a useful model for the evolution of terrestriality, showing that even subtle anatomical changes can result in the large changes in physiological function necessary for the terrestrial invasion.",,,,,"SYMP ON THE COMPLEAT CRAB, AT THE 1990 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN SOC OF ZOOLOGISTSSYMP ON THE COMPLEAT CRAB, AT THE 1990 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN SOC OF ZOOLOGISTS","DEC 27-30, 1990DEC 27-30, 1990",AMER SOC ZOOLOGISTSAMER SOC ZOOLOGISTS,"SAN ANTONIO, TXSAN ANTONIO, TX",24,0,0,0,17,0,28,,,0003-1569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1992-01-01,WOS:A1992KR81400009,,,,,
