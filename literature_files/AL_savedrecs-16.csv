Limited shoreline verification is restricted to the navigable area (typically seaward of the 4 meter contour). In this area, surveyors confirm or disprove the presence of features, where a feature can be any anthropogenic or natural object that may merit individual cartographic representation (e.g. rocks, wrecks, obstructions), identify and position features not detected using aircraft or satellite based photogrammetry, and obtain heights on significant features. Currently, NOAA's Office of Marine and Aviation Operations field units utilize hydrographic survey launches or skiffs with personnel on board to get close enough to shoreline features to obtain a position, an activity that is generally inefficient and inherently dangerous.Other technologies have been applied to this task with differing degrees of success. Examples include airborne lidar, vessel mounted, side-looking lidar, and satellite based bathymetry. Each of these have each demonstrated certain advantages, but also come with operational and logistical constraints, environmental limitation, and mobilization cost. Advancements in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and photogrammetric techniques, specifically structure from motion (SfM), make these platforms a tempting choice for this mission. The combination of relatively low vehicle and sensor cost, small platform size, and ease of operations may allow collection of high-resolution shoreline data from a safe distance, without ever having to put manned platforms in harm's way. Under this approach, the surveyor deploys an UAS with a mounted digital camera and flies pre-programmed flight paths to cover a survey area with overlapping aerial photographs. SfM processing of this imagery yields both 3D point clouds and an image mosaic.We report our success to date with this approach, including the substantial regulatory and administrative aspects of planning and executing these missions. While the regulatory aspects of unmanned aerial systems are rapidly evolving, we outline a reasonable and well-vetted approach for operators that has been successful for our work. We believe that demonstrating a consistent and pro-active commitment to safe operations and full compliance with environmental and regulatory aspects will be critical to the development of this technology. We share the operation risk management and best management practices developed so far.We also report on our data processing pipeline and findings from operations conducted in realistic field environments. Similar to other work in this field, we find proper image and environmental parameters are critical. Sun glint, cloud cover, and image quality are important. We also fmd waves (in particular breaking waves) cause difficulty in SIM processing, but interestingly, often convey important information about submerged features that are of particular interest. Where image processing to a SfM model is successful, we find positional accuracies are well within horizontal product specifications horizontally - even with inexpensive, consumer grade (MISS systems. Precise vertical control is more of a challenge. We report a tradeoff between establishing a network of ground control stations and establishing robust vehicle positioning through more advance methods such as post-processed kinematic (PPK).With further development, these UAS derived products mad augment traditional shoreline products to provide the high resolution and confidence to eliminate or significantly curtail the need to operate manned boats in the near shore environment.",,,,,Conference on OCEANS MTS/IEEE CharlestonConference on OCEANS MTS/IEEE Charleston,"OCT 22-25, 2018OCT 22-25, 2018",IEEE CharlestonIEEE Charleston,"Charleston, SCCharleston, SC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-5386-4814-8,,,,,,,,,"Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Hydrog Syst & Technol Branch, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA",,,,2019-04-05,WOS:000461320202068,,

Few significant differences were detected in the chlorophyll a pigment analyses; however, Delta F/F-m' appeared sensitive to petrochemical exposure. Dispersing both types of oil resulted in a substantial increase in the TPH of the WAF and was generally correlated with a greater physiological impact to the seagrass health, compared with the oil alone.

Similarly, global expansion of grasslands and their newly evolved, carbon-rich soils (Mollisols) over the past 40 million years may have induced global cooling and ushered in Pleistocene glaciation. Grassland evolution has been considered a consequence of mountain uplift and tectonic reorganization of ocean currents, but it can also be viewed as a biological force for global change through coevolution of grasses and grazers. Organisms in such coevolutionary trajectories adapt to each other rather than to their environment, and so can be forces for global change. Some past farming practices have aided greenhouse gas release.

We examined the seasonal change of greenhouse gas emissions in both restored wetland and natural wetland and then evaluated the carbon sequestration capacity of the restored wetland. We found that (1) the carbon sink capacity of the restored wetland showed clear daily and seasonal change, which was affected by light intensity, air temperature, and vegetation growth, and (2) the annual daytime (8-18 hr) sustained-flux global warming potential was -11.23 +/- 4.34 kg CO2 m(-2) y(-1), representing a much larger carbon sink than natural wetland (-5.04 +/- 3.73 kg CO2 m(-2) y(-1)) from April to December.

In general, SYMs consists of mooring framework support, mooring legs, yoke, and single-point turret and it forms a multibody dynamic system with 13 hinge joint structures such as universal joints and thrust bearings. The hinge joint is one of the key components of SYMs; therefore, it is necessary to accurately evaluate the operating behavior of the hinge joints. In this study, real-time damage identification is conducted based on the multibody dynamic features of the SYMs. First, a long-term monitoring strategy for the prototype application is developed based on the multibody governing equations of the SYMs. The motion behaviors and stress state of the hinge joints and bodies are calculated using prototype monitoring data. A hinge joint damage identification based on the virtual moment is proposed by considering the changes in the friction coefficient in the damage state. The virtual moment method is used to transform the damage identification problem of the SYMs into a problem of seeking the optimal solution to the dynamics identification function. Genetic algorithm (GA) is implemented to seek the optimal solution of the friction coefficient of each hinge joint. A large-scale model testing system of the SYMs is established to perform the damage identification of the bottom hinge joints of the SYMs. The results show that the proposed method can effectively identify the damage degree and position of the hinge joints of the SYMs and provide a real-time warning system for the in-service operation of the SYMs.",,,,,,,,,4,3,0,0,0,0,6,,,0951-8339,1873-4170,,,,,,,,,,"Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Vehicle Engn & Mech, Dalian 116024, Peoples R ChinaDalian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Struct Anal Ind Equipment, Dalian 116024, Peoples R ChinaChina Natl Offshore Oil Corp CNOOC, Res Inst, Beijing 100027, Peoples R ChinaDalian Univ Technol, Sch Ocean Sci & Technol, Panjin 124000, Peoples R China",,,,2020-10-06,WOS:000571825700001,,

To investigate whether cloned ion channels with electrophysiologic properties similar to the S channel (potassium selectivity, outward rectification, and activation independent of voltage) also are modulated by volatile anesthetic agents, the authors expressed the cloned yeast ion channel TOK1 (tandem pore domain, outwardly rectifying K+ channel) in Xenopus oocytes and studied its sensitivity to volatile agents.Methods: Standard two-electrode voltage and patch clamp recording methods were used to study TOK1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes.Results: Studies with two-electrode voltage clamp at room temperature showed that halothane, isoflurane, and desflurane increased TOK1 outward currents by 48-65% in barium Frog Ringer's perfusate. The concentrations at which 50% potentiation occurred (EC50 values) were in the range of 768-814 mu M (0.016-0.044 atm) and had a rank order of potency in atm in which halothane > isoflurane > desflurane. The potentiation of TOK1 by volatile anesthetic agents was rapid and reversible (onset and offset, 1-20 s). Ln contrast, the non-anesthetic 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane did not potentiate TOK1 currents in concentrations up to five times the MAC value predicted by the Meyer-Overton hypothesis based on oil/gas partition coefficients. Single TOK1 channel currents were recorded from excised outside-out patches. The single channel open probability increased as much as twofold in the presence of isoflurane and rapidly returned to the baseline values on washout. Volatile anesthetic agents did not alter the TOK1 single channel current-voltage (I-V) relationship, however, suggesting that the site of action does not affect the permeation pathway of the channelConclusion: TOK1 is a potassium channel that is stimulated by volatile anesthetic agents. The concentrations over which potentiation occurred (EC50 values) were higher than those commonly used in clinical practice (approximately twice MAC).",,,,,5th International Conference on Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Anaesthesia5th International Conference on Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Anaesthesia,"JUN 18-20, 1997JUN 18-20, 1997",,"UNIV CALGARY, CALGARY, CANADAUNIV CALGARY, CALGARY, CANADA",38,1,0,0,13,0,39,,,0003-3022,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif San Francisco, Med Ctr, Anesthesia Res Lab, Sch Med,Dept Anesthesia, San Francisco, CA 94143 USANeurex Corp, Menlo Park, CA USA",Neurex Corp,,,1998-04-01,WOS:000073024700029,9579518,

Straw biochar was incorporated once into soil in pots at five different rates: 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% (dry biochar weight/wet soil weight). Compared to yields from the control treatment with no biochar, rice grain yield was improved by 29.1-34.2% in the treatments with 10-15% biochar in the first year following biochar application. In the second year following biochar application, the rice yield was increased by 51.8-96.0% in the treatments with 15-20% biochar.

Identification and implementation of a suitable life extension strategy enables safety critical systems to perform their intended functions under stated condition for an extended period of time beyond original design life. In the past, the viability analysis of life extension strategies has been undertaken based on the accumulated knowledge and experience of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), maintenance engineers and inspectors. These approaches involving expert judgement are qualitative in nature and based on conservative assumptions, which may lead to inaccurate conclusion or misleading recommendations to asset managers. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an approach consisting of methods to determine the technical condition of components, estimate the cost of life extension interventions and to analyze carbon footprints. Remanufacturing is considered as a suitable end-of-life strategy that can help reduce the overall environmental burden from the product by processing waste materials while at the same time keeping reliability high. Due to the advantages of remanufacturing, it is widely applied for life extension purposes in safety critical industries such as offshore oil and gas, nuclear power, petrochemical, renewable energy, rail transport, aviation, shipping, and electricity distribution and transmission. In this paper, a multi-stage approach is presented to analyze the impact of remanufacturing of safety critical systems on the performance of industrial operations in terms of total cost and carbon footprint. In this approach, the equipment health status is determined by modelling the degradation of the system and then the maintenance costs and carbon footprint are calculated. For the purpose of clarity, the proposed model is applied to an air compressor system and the results are discussed. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The energy that might be produced with methane contained in hydrates is greater than any amount of energy producible with known conventional energy sources; being widespread in all oceans, they would greatly reduce problems and conflicts associated with the monopoly of energy sources. The possibility of extracting methane and simultaneously performing the permanent storage of carbon dioxide makes hydrate an almost carbon-neutral energy source. The main topic of scientific research is to improve the recovery of technologies and guest species replacement strategies in order to make the use of gas hydrates economically advantageous. In the present paper, an experimental study on how salt can alter the formation process of both methane and carbon dioxide hydrate was carried out. The pressure-temperature conditions existing between the two respective equilibrium curves are directly proportional to the effectiveness of the replacement process and thus its feasibility. Eighteen formation tests were realized at three different salinity values: 0, 30 and 37 g/L. Results show that, as the salinity degree increases, the space between CO2 and CH4 formation curves grows. A further aspect highlighted by the tests is how the carbon dioxide formation process tends to assume a very similar trend in all experiments, while curves obtained during methane tests show a similar trend but with some significant differences. Moreover, this tendency became more pronounced with the increase in the salinity degree.",,,,,,,,,33,3,0,0,0,0,36,,,,2227-9717,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Perugia, Engn Dept, Via G Duranti 67, I-06125 Perugia, Italy",,,,2020-11-18,WOS:000586211000001,,

To investigate those factors that may preclude hexadecane mineralization activity in long-term hydrocarbon-contaminated soils from the Ross Sea Region, samples were collected from Scott Base, the site of former bases (Cape Evans, Marble Point, Vanda Station), and two oil spill sites in the Wright Valley (Bull Pass and Loop Moraine). The soils had low levels of nitrogen (<0.1% total N) and a high C/N ratio (>24) reflecting hydrocarbon contamination. Following soil water adjustment to 10% (v/w), the influence of nutrient addition (250 mg/kg N added as monoammonium phosphate) and inoculation (spiking with Antarctic soil containing high numbers of hydrocarbon degraders) as required on hexadecane mineralization activity was determined. Hexadecane mineralization activity occurred in contaminated soils from Marble Point, Cape Evans and one sample from Vanda Station without nutrient addition. In contrast soils from Scott Base, Cape Evans, another sample from Vanda Station and Loop Moraine required nutrients, whereas Bull Pass soil required inoculation and nutrients before hexadecane mineralization proceeded. Hydrocarbon degrader numbers were highest in coastal soils from Scott Base and Marble Point (10(7) per gram) and less prevalent in inland soils from Wright Valley (<10(5) per gram). The bacterial community structure of the soils differed between sites, but soils from the same sites tended to cluster together more closely, except for those from Vanda Station. Addition of nutrients did not cause large shifts in the soil bacterial communities. Results from this study indicate that hydrocarbon degradation may occur at some sites in summer when water is available. Long-term hydrocarbon-contaminated Antarctic soils may provide a valuable resource of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria that can serve as inocula for more recent oil spills on land.

An essential part of an automated MPD control system is the downhole pressure estimator, usually referred to as the hydraulic model, which in most cases is the limiting factor for achievable accuracy of the system. In this paper we present a new design of an adaptive observer for online estimation of the downhole pressure in the well. Unlike conventional hydraulic models, which are based on complex partial differential equations, the adaptive observer is based on a simplified lumped model of ordinary differential equations, combined with online adaptation that tunes uncertain model parameters utilizing topside measurements. We demonstrate that the novell adaptive observer design captures the important hydraulics of MPD operations with high accuracy, and fundamentally improves the convergence rate of the parameter estimaties by using delayed observers.

Furthermore, the comparison between coupling device and only electrocoagulation through tracking oil removal in nine regions between the electrodes. The results were shown that the permanent magnets applied was found to enhance demulsification process within electrocoagulation reactor. For a given current density of 60 A m(-2) at 16 min, Lorentz force downward was proved to promote the sedimentation of coagulants. As the magnetic field strength increases from 20 to 60 mT, oil removal efficiency was observed to increase and then decrease, and simultaneously energy consumption reduced and then present constantly. The results were found that the magnetic field strength of 40 mT was optimal within electrocoagulation reactor, which can not only diminishe difference of mass transfer rate along the height of vertical plate but also consume lowest energy.

For many years, most oil field wastes were disposed of at a significant cost. However over the past decade, the industry has developed many processes and technologies to minimize the generation of wastes and to more safely and economically dispose of the waste that is generated. Many companies follow a three-tiered waste management approach. First, companies try to minimize waste generation when possible. Next, they try to find ways to reuse or recycle the wastes that are generated. Finally, the wastes that cannot be reused or recycled must be disposed of. Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne) has evaluated the feasibility of various oil field waste management technologies for the U.S. Department of Energy. This paper describes four of the technologies Argonne has reviewed. In the area of waste minimization, the industry has developed synthetic-based drilling muds (SBMs) that have the desired drilling properties of oil-based muds without the accompanying adverse environmental impacts. Use of SBMs avoids significant air pollution from work boats hauling offshore cuttings to shore for disposal and provides more efficient drilling than can be achieved with water-based muds. Downhole oil/water separators have been developed to separate produced water from oil at the bottom of wells. The produced water is directly injected to an underground formation without ever being lifted to the surface, thereby avoiding potential for groundwater or soil contamination: In the area of reuse/recycle, Argonne has worked with Southeastern Louisiana University and industry to develop a process to use treated drill cuttings to restore wetlands in coastal Louisiana. Finally, in an example of treatment and disposal, Argonne has conducted a series of four baseline studies to characterize the use of salt caverns for safe and economic disposal of oil field wastes.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,0,9,,,0195-0738,1528-8994,,,,,,,,,,"Argonne Natl Lab, Washington, DC 20024 USA",,,,2003-09-01,WOS:000185311400010,,

The comparative study was performed with marine gas oil (MGO), natural gas, and hydrogen with various energy sources for a 12,000 gross tonne (GT) coastal ferry operating in the Republic of Korea (ROK). Considering the energy imports of ROK, i.e., MGO from Saudi Arabia and natural gas from Qatar, these countries were chosen to provide the MGO and the natural gas for the LCA. The hydrogen is considered to be produced by steam methane reforming (SMR) from natural gas with hard coal, nuclear energy, renewable energy, and electricity in the ROK model. The lifecycles of the fuels were analyzed in classifications of Well-to- Tank, Tank-to-Wake, and Well-to-Wake phases. The environmental impacts were provided in terms of global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), photochemical potential (POCP), eutrophication potential (EP), and particulate matter (PM).

However, the commercialization of these technologies for bulk commodities requires a great reduction in the current microalgal biomass production cost. The bioreactor is the core of bioprocess engineering and is the premise for the commercial application of certain types of biotechnology. The challenges of phototrophic cultivation are completely different from those of heterotrophic processes because the efficiency of phototrophic cultivation is limited by the energy density of the input sunlight and the inorganic carbon supply. Thus, the development of microalgae cultivation technologies with low manufacturing and operating costs is key to addressing this problem, and floating photobioreactors (PBRs) are a promising solution. PBRs are deployed on the water surface without any land requirements, and wave energy provides free mixing energy. Additionally, the surrounding water can be used to control the culture temperature and to supply nutrients for microalgae growth. In this mini-review, the development of floating PBRs and their recent progress are presented. The effect of the carbon supply approach on the mixing and scaling-up of floating PBRs are critically discussed. The limitations and challenges in commercial applications of floating PBRs are analysed, and the need for future research is proposed.

Basin development occurred in several stages between late Carboniferous and late Cretaceous times. Partial tectonic inversion took place during two compressive events, the so-called 'Pyrenean' and 'Alpine' phases of late Cretaceous-early Tertiary and late Tertiary ages respectively. They are separated by an intervening stretching event of Oligocene age, which further south resulted in the opening of the western Mediterranean oceanic basin. As a result of this complex tectonic history, structural traps were difficult to image on the seismic data shot during the first phase of exploration prior to 1980. Oil and gas natural seeps, and shows in several wells, indicate that some petroleum systems are, or have been active, at least in some places.The present erosional western margin of the basin is more or less superimposed on the initial Triassic-Jurassic margin. Margin subsidence and Tertiary inversion are discussed using regional sections on which the polyphase history of the entire basin is well shown. These sections are located on three major segments where the Mesozoic margin is either partly preserved (Ardeche), or has been partly inverted in late Tertiary times (Vercors-Chartreuse), or has been completely inverted in early Tertiary times (Corbieres-eastern Pyrenees). 1-D 'Genex' basin modelling on the Ardeche segment, and 2-D 'Thrustpack' structural-maturity modelling in the Vercors-Chartreuse segment are used to further assess the remaining petroleum plays.

An unknown portion of this oil that arrived along the Alabama shoreline interacted with nearshore sediments and sank forming submerged oil mats (SOMs). A considerable amount of hydrocarbons, including poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were trapped within these buried SOMs. Recent studies completed using the oil spill residues collected along the Alabama shoreline have shown that several PAHs, especially higher molecular weight PAHs (four or more aromatic rings), are slowly weathering compared to the weathering levels experienced by the oil when it was floating over the GOM. In this study we have hypothesized that the weathering rates of PAHs in SOMs have slowed down because the buried oil was isolated from direct exposure to sunlight, thus hindering the photodegradation pathway. We further hypothesized that re-exposing SOMs to sunfight can reactivate various weathering reactions. Also, SOMs contain 75-95% sand (by weight) and the entrapped sand could either block direct sunlight or form large oil agglomerates with very little exposed surface area; these processes could possibly interfere with weathering reactions. To test these hypotheses, we completed controlled experiments to study the weathering patterns of PAHs in a field recovered SOM sample after re-exposing it to sunlight. Our experimental results show that the weathering levels of several higher molecular weight PAHs have slowed down primarily due to the absence of sunlight-induced photodegradation reactions. The data-also show that sand particles in SOM material could potentially interfere with photodegradation reactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Based on an appropriate stirring speed and time, a relatively uniform and stable hydrates slurry were formed from a water-in-oil emulsion to study the hydrates formation and slurry viscosity under different water cuts, bath temperatures and AAs concentrations. The influence of water cut on hydrates formation and hydrates slurry viscosity is much more significant than that of bath temperature and AAs concentration. Results indicate that the hydrates volume fraction, the continuous liquid phase viscosity and the dispersion degree of hydrates particles in the slurry are the critical factors to affect the viscosity of natural gas hydrates slurry. Considering both of aggregation and breakage of hydrates particles, a natural gas hydrates slurry viscosity semi-empirical model is developed based on the Einstein effective medium theory. The key parameter non-Newtonian coefficient K of this model is determined by several empirical correlations according to the experimental conditions and fluid properties. The consistence of predicted and experimental data demonstrates the feasibility of this model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

HCl is electrochemically removed from the ocean and neutralized through reaction with silicate rocks. The alkaline solution resulting from the removal of HCl is neutralized by capturing atmospheric CO2 and is dissolved into the ocean where the carbon will be stored primarily as HCO3- without further acidifying the ocean. On time scales of hundreds of years or longer, some of the additional alkalinity is expected to lead to precipitation or enhanced preservation of CaCO3, resulting in the permanent storage of the associated carbon, and the return of an equal amount of carbon to the atmosphere. The overall process is equivalent to the earth's natural chemical weathering process of silicate rocks. Whereas the natural silicate weathering process is effected primarily by carbonic acid, the engineered process accelerates the weathering kinetics to industrial rates by replacing this weak acid with HCl. In the thermodynamic limit-and with the appropriate silicate rocks-the overall reaction is spontaneous. A range of efficiency scenarios indicates that the process should require 100 - 400 kJ of work per mol of CO2 captured and stored for relevant timescales. The process can be powered from stranded energy sources too remote to be useful for the direct needs of populations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydrocarbons were found positioned at similar to 1100-1300 m with thickness similar to 100-150 m and moving horizontally to the SW in a vertically stratified layer at the junction of the cold abyssal water and the permanent thermocline. This study focuses on its formation process and fate of the hydrocarbons within. The originality of this work to the field is two-fold, first it provides a conceptual framework which places layer origin in the context of a horizontal intrusion from the near-field, vertical, blow-out plume and second, it offers a theoretical model for the hydrocarbon chemicals within the horizontal layer as it moves far-afield. The model quantifies the oil-material fractionation process for the soluble and fine particle. The classical Box model, retrofitted with an internal gradient, the G-Box, allows an approach that includes turbulent-eddy diffusion coupled with droplet rise velocity and reactive decay to produce a simple, explicit, transparent, algebraic model with few parameters for the fate of the individual fractions. Computations show the soluble and smallest liquid droplets moving very slowly vertically through the layer appearing within the trapping layer at low concentration with high persistence. The larger droplets move-through this trapping zone quickly, attain high concentrations, and eventually form the sea surface slick. It impacts the field of oil spill engineering science by providing the conceptual idea and the algorithms for projecting the quantities and fractions of oil-material in a deep water, horizontal marine current being dispersed and moving far afield. In the field of oil spill modeling this work extends the current generation near-field plume source models to the far-field. The theory portrays the layer as an efficient oil material trap. The model-forecasted concentration profiles for alkanes and aromatics against the available field data support the proposed theory and the resulting model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Over 8500 United States Coast Guard personnel were deployed in response to the spill. Little is understood about the acute neurological effects of oil spill clean-uprelated exposures. Given the large number of people involved in large oil spill clean-ups, study of these effects is warranted.Methods: We utilized exposure, health, and lifestyle data from a post-deployment survey administered to Coast Guard responders to the DWH oil spill. Crude oil exposure was assessed via self-reported inhalation and skin contact metrics, categorized by frequency of self-reported exposure to crude oil during deployment (never, rarely, sometimes, most/all of the time). Combined exposure to crude oil and oil dispersant was also evaluated. Adjusted log binomial regressions were used to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), investigating the associations between oil spill exposures and neurological symptoms during deployment. Stratified analyses investigated potential effect modification by sex, exhaust fume exposure, personal protective equipment (PPE) use, and deployment duration and timing.Results: Increasing frequency of crude oil exposure via inhalation was associated with increased likelihood of headaches (PRmost/all (vs.) (never) = 1.80), lightheadedness (PRmost/all vs. never = 3.36), difficulty concentrating (PRmost/all vs. never = 1.72), numbness/tingling sensation (PRmost/all vs. never = 3.32), blurred vision (PRmost/all vs. (never) = 2.87), and memory loss/confusion (PRmost/all vs. never = 2.03), with significant tests for trend. Similar results were found for crude oil exposure via skin contact. Exposure to both oil and oil dispersants yielded associations that were appreciably greater in magnitude than for oil alone for all neurological symptoms. Sensitivity analyses excluding responders in the highest environmental heat categories and responders with relevant pre-existing conditions indicated robustness of these results. Stratified analyses indicated possible effect modification by sex, PPE use, and heat exposure.Conclusions: This study provides evidence of a cross sectional association between crude oil exposures and acute neurological symptoms in a sample of U.S. Coast Guard responders. Additionally, it suggests that exposure to both crude oil and oil dispersant may result in stronger associations and that heat may interact synergistically with oil exposures resulting in more acute neurological symptoms.

Airborne laser scanning (ALS) and imaging spectroscopy (IS) are two potentially complementary remote sensing technologies capable of characterizing and monitoring regional forest health. However, the combined use of ALS and IS data to classify the health of individual trees has not yet been assessed. In this study we propose a new approach utilizing ALS and IS combined to characterize the health of individual trees. Firstly, we applied a recently developed bottom-up individual tree delineation algorithm across a structurally complex floodplain eucalypt forest that has experienced episodes of severe dieback over the past six decades. We further calculated ALS and IS indices for delineated tree crowns and used them as predictor variables in machine learning models. We trained and evaluated an object-oriented random forest classifier against field-measured tree crown dieback and transparency ratios, as indicators of eucalypt tree health and crown density, respectively. Our results showed that die back levels of individual trees can be classified using ALS and IS with an overall accuracy of 81% and a kappa score of 0.66, while the classification of tree crown transparency levels had an overall accuracy of 70% and a kappa score of 0.5. Returned pulse width, intensity and density related ALS indices were the most important predictors in the tree health classification, as they accounted for >40% of the variance in the data. At the forest level in terms of die back, 81.5% of correctly delineated trees were classified as healthy, 12.3% as declining and 6.2% as dying or dead. Dieback occurred primarily in areas that were flooded <5% of the time, as quantified by Landsat derived flooding frequency (1986-2011). Our results provide a novel application of ALS and IS to accurately classify the health of individual trees in a structurally complex eucalypt forest, enabling us to prioritize areas for forest health promotion and conservation of biodiversity.

To achieve these accomplishments several technology challenges are being unveiled. In topside upstream application both offshore and onshore, one important technology issue is the capability to compress gas with a significant amount of liquids and it assumes a special interest in case of the facilities revamping. Nevertheless is in the subsea environment where this technology issue becomes really challenging. In order to properly design and size a compressor/motor system for subsea wet gas compression, one must be able to adequately predict the compressor performance with mixed phase flow.This paper presents the results from an experimental test program which investigated the performance of a centrifugal compressor at various wet gas conditions with elevated suction pressure. Performance tests are completed on a two stage centrifugal compressor with a mixture of air and water at suction pressures of 20 bar (300 psi). The compressor is subjected to flow with liquid volume fractions ranging from 0 to 5% along three speedlines.The performance measurements are made in accordance with ASME PTC-10 specifications with an additional torque measurement on the shaft between the compressor and gearbox. At each test condition, once the liquid is injected in the air flow, an increase in pressure ratio occurs. This testifies the compressor is still able to work in presence of water. However, increasing the amount of liquid injected a decreased polytropic head together with an increased absorbed actual power by the compressor cause a deterioration of its efficiency. Moreover when liquid is introduced into the flow, the discharge temperature of the compressor reduces significantly.The performance results and trends mentioned above reviewed in the detail in this paper.",,,,,ASME Turbo Expo 2012ASME Turbo Expo 2012,"JUN 11-15, 2012JUN 11-15, 2012",Int Gas Turine InstInt Gas Turine Inst,"Copenhagen, DENMARKCopenhagen, DENMARK",4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,,,978-0-7918-4472-4,,,,,,,,,"GE Oil & Gas, Florence, Italy",,,,2013-11-07,WOS:000324957800017,,

This paper explores the safety and reliability assessment of a managed pressure drilling operation by investigating the kick control operation of constant bottomhole pressure technique of managed pressure drilling. In addition, this study seeks to understand the components interactions in an MPD system and their modes of failure. Failure scenarios are first built using a Fault Tree model and then analyzed using a Bayesian Network model. The reliability assessments of kick control operation are performed in two ways: a basic-components approach and a system-barrier elements approach. The analysis identifies communication related components, including network device damage as the most safety-critical component due to their high-level of influence while flowline and pump line blockages/rupture are ranked second-most critical but with limited-level of influence. However, the system-barrier element approach ranks the managed pressure drilling control system as the most safety-critical equipment. Further detailed analysis confirms that the monitoring equipment are the most safety-critical components of the managed pressure drilling control system with Coriolis flow meter and Rig pump exhibiting the most critical monitoring equipment.

Detailed reservoir characterization studies of the formation are required to support field development and improved / enhanced oil recovery (EOR) programmes. In this study, 26 wells penetrating the Mauddud Formation within the Greater Burgan area of Kuwait (Burgan and neighbouring fields) were investigated, integrating the logging of 910 ft of core with petrographic investigations of 113 stained and impregnated thin sections. In the Greater Burgan area, the Mauddud Formation can be divided into a lower Clastic Member and an upper Carbonate Member which is the main focus of this paper. The primary objective of the study was to present a new characterization of this thin, heterogeneous carbonate reservoir by integrating facies analysis and sequence stratigraphy with a detailed petrographic investigation. A second objective was to identify the relative importance of depositional characteristics and diagenesis on the distribution of reservoir properties. Sandstones in the Clastic Member of the Mauddud Formation were deposited on a delta which passed laterally to the north and east into a carbonate platform. During subsequent regional flooding, increased carbonate production resulted in the development of a larger-scale carbonate platform covering the entire study area. The Burgan field area was part of the proximal zone of this carbonate platform. A number of depositional environments were identified by integrating core and thin section data. These range from outer platform to mid- and inner platform, the latter including both high- and low-energy settings (shoal, shoreline; and lagoonal respectively). Mud-supported textures characteristic of low-energy inner-platform and mid- to outer-platform settings are volumetrically dominant in the Mauddud Carbonate Member. Sequence stratigraphic analysis suggests that the Mauddud Carbonate Member is part of a major regressive phase (or highstand systems tract) of a third-order sequence, with the regional-scale K110 MFS positioned close to the transition with the underlying Clastic Member. Two 4(th)order transgressive - regressive (TR) cycles or sequences, M1 and M2, were identified within the Carbonate Member. The top-Mauddud surface corresponds to a sequence boundary with long-lasting subaerial exposure during the latest Albian and is characterized by both micro- and macroscopic karst features (calcite dissolution vugs and recrystallization in thin sections; and cavities in cores). This study demonstrates that the Burgan field area experienced significant uplift, with increased differential erosion and/or non-deposition of the upper M2 TR cycle towards the southwest. Eogenetic marine and meteoric calcite cements partially fill macropores close to the tops of the TR cycles and remaining macropores were occluded by shallow-burial calcite cements. Cementation by ferroan dolomite cement, which resulted from the increased overburden and associated chemical compaction, has almost entirely occluded residual macropores in the lower part of the Mauddud Carbonate Member, close to the underlying siliciclastic deposits of the Clastic Member. As a consequence, porosity is mostly preserved in the middle part of the Carbonate Member.The predominance of mud-supported textures in these intervals together with the effects of diagenesis explain the widespread occurrence of microporosity within both micritic matrix and grains. In the Greater Burgan area, meteoric diagenesis associated with subaerial exposure(s) of the top-Mauddud preserved and/or enhanced micrite microporosity. Plug porosity may reach 35% or more, but permeability does not exceed 100 mD. The Mauddud Carbonate Member in the Greater Burgan area is a thin, microporous reservoir, with a dual porosity component which is linked to karst alteration and not to tectonic fracturing.

To estimate changes in the carbon pools and carbon fluxes to the atmosphere, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data of 1992 and 1996 were used to calculate the extent of different land cover types and their changes in the estuary area of the Yellow River delta. Image processing and the unsupervised classification allowed accurate land cover maps for 1992 and 1996 to be generated, by which the changes in the carbon pools were detected. Estimation of the carbon pools and the carbon fluxes to the atmosphere was carried out employing the results of Landsat image analysis and the published data on carbon stocks in vegetation and soil. By calculating the area changed between different types of vegetation and their different carbon stocks, the quantity of the terrestrial carbon cycle in the estuary area of the Yellow River delta was acquired. The results shows that the vegetation carbon storage was 11.43 x 10(11) g and soil carbon pool 7.24 x 10(12) g in 1992, and the vegetation carbon pool increased by 3.77 x 10(11) g during the 4 years from 1992 to 1996.",,,,,,,,,15,4,0,0,10,0,20,,,0143-1161,1366-5901,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R ChinaUniv Arizona, Dept Geog, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,,,2002-04-01,WOS:000174957600002,,

Two horizontal wells and virtual sources can minimize the problems caused by the near-surface complexity and the variation in source position during monitoring. In traditional monitoring using P-waves, the change in the P-wave velocity (V-P) is affected not only by the injected CO2 but also by geological changes. Conversely, the S-wave velocity (V-S) is affected only by the geological changes in the reservoir because the S-wave does not propagate through the pore fluid. Consequently, monitoring using both the P- and S-waves gives more accurate and useful information on the target layers. In this study, we developed an effective monitoring method that not only detects the boundary of CO2 plumes but also identifies the cause of the velocity change; this method uses two horizontal wells and virtual sources. The V-P/V-S ratio obtained from the P- and S-wave velocity tomograms from the synthesized data clearly distinguished the cause of the velocity change and the velocity tomograms sets successfully described the velocity change due to CO2 plume injection or lithological changes.

However, it may be difficult to detect the changes in P-wave responses beyond a certain level of saturation. A comprehensive 3D finite-difference time domain (FDTD) forward modeling, based on idealized subsurface resistivity structures, demonstrates the possibility of marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) surveying to monitor the movement of subsurface CO2 storage. We focused on CSEM sensitivity studies with respect to variations in geometry and/or saturation of CO2 storage, evaluation of the effects of reservoir depths and lithology, and detection of CO2 leakage from the main storage. A 100% lateral expansion from the initial diameter (1500 m) of a typical CO2 plume with thickness and resistivity of 100 m and 80 Omega m, respectively, at 850 m below seafloor, results in 41% electric field (E-field) magnitude increase at 2500 m source-receiver offset for 0.5 Hz source frequency. In comparison, a 300% vertical expansion of a 50 m thick plume with diameter and resistivity of 2500 m and 80 Omega m, respectively, gives only a 7% E-field magnitude anomaly. An increase of the aspect ratio of a CO2 plume with diameter and thickness of 1750 and 130 m, respectively, by 110%, without volumetric change, results in a 20% E-field magnitude increase. The E-field magnitude differences due to CO2 saturation change by 20% in clay-rich (10% clay) and clean reservoirs are almost identical; thus, a time-lapse anomaly in a clay-rich reservoir might be detectable. A gradual inverse variation of offset and frequency can differentiate the responses of a 50 m thick shallow CO2 accumulation, 200 m below the seafloor, from the main CO2 plume at 850 m below the seafloor and allow for early warning of CO2 leakage.",,,,,,,,,25,3,0,0,0,0,31,,,0016-8033,1942-2156,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Petr Engn & Appl Geophys, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2012-10-24,WOS:000309077200011,,

Three main items of discussion: elephants and tusks, ceramics and bronze objects are representatives of the archaeological findings and historical evidence of the explanation of the concept. The Following were among the findings of this study: (1) Elephant has played a pivotal role in the livelihood and customs of Thai people from the remote past until the present. Its higher status, particularly a royal elephant and a symbol of king’s prestige, reflects an adoption of Hindu and Buddhist influences. Thai scholars invented the concept of royal white elephant clans and technical manual for catching wild elephant and tame it for serving man’s activities. The elephant’s roles had been changed when a diplomatic trade established and tamed elephant was a tribute and a white elephant, a precious gift, presented to a Chinese emperor by a Thai’s king. A live elephant and elephant tusk (ivory) trade that had been continuously increased when overseas commerce with India, Japan, and the European countries actively took place since the early 17th century. The Thai absolute monarchy had a monopoly on elephant and tusks trade. For two centuries of elephant and tusks trade, a population of elephant had decreased markedly. (2) Ceramics have been either imported or exported items. The discovery of earthenware potsherds of ‘Indo-Roman roulettes ware’ in Southeast Asian sites including Thailand indicates that the first to second- century Roman-Indian trade network distributed throughout the region before the advent of Hinduism and Buddhism. Evidence of the eighth-century torpedo stoneware jars bearing the Pahlavi inscription of the Persian Gulf as well as some Chinese glazed stoneware bearing the Arab inscription found at a shipwreck and port sites in Thailand suggests that the local emporium and middlemen trading with Chinese, Indian, Arab and Persian were established. Local craftsmen that were already skilled at pyro-technology were easily to acquire Chinese glazed stoneware technique to produce the first glazed ‘Buriram ceramic’, popularly known as ‘Khmer ceramic’ and it was only exported in the mainland Southeast Asia, whereas a fine grain ‘Pa-O’ earthenware from southern Thailand was overseas exported. By tracing Thai glazed stoneware ‘Sangkhalok’ exported to Ryukyu island and Japan, there appears a glimpse of trade interaction with Korea. Between 14th and 17th century the Thai ceramic as a commodity itself or a container for local product had been exported to the world market as well as the Chinese and Japanese ceramics were imported to the country. A reciprocal imitation of ceramic styles and designs for trade occurred between 17th and 18th century in the time of the first Thai polychrome enameling porcelain occurred. (3) Bronze objects, especially high-tin bronze weapon, vessel and ornament had been developed since 2000 BCE, but the discovery of the Chinese bronze kettle drum of the 5th to 1st century BCE points towards the theory that the maritime contact with the Far East (China) was established and its spiritual tradition was absorbed prior to that with India. The metallurgical knowledge handed down to religious artisans, sculptors of the historical states in which bronze images of Buddha and other Buddhist icons and objects were sophistically developed. It is hypothesized that an image of Buddha in particular posture/gesture had been created on the basis of identification of Buddha’s teachings (philosophy) related to the significant episodes of the Buddha’s life to be ideally suited to the indigenous people’s life style and other factors of their community of the time rather than direct imitation of art styles imported from India or Sri Lanka.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1225-3308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-01-01,KJD:ART002322123,,

To explore this mystery, a lithium tracer study was conducted along two transects on one of these beaches. The tracer injections and transports were successfully simulated using the 2-dimensional numerical model MARUN. The tracer stayed much longer in the oil-persisting, right transect (facing landwand) than in the clean, left transect. If the tracer is approximately regarded as oils, oils in the upper layer would have more opportunities to enter the lower layer in the right transect than in the left one. This may qualitatively explain the oil persistence within the right transect. When the tracer is regarded as nutrients, the long stay of nutrients within the right transect implies that the oil persistence along the right transect was not due to the lack of nutrients during the bioremediation.

Contamination can be accidental or deliberate. Point sources include industrial and household effluents, which are often cleaned in wastewater-treatment plants (WWTP), and enter recipient waters in effluent pipes. Particularly in the past, but even nowadays, effluents can be discharged into aquatic bodies with virtually no cleaning. This minimal cleaning is a deliberate choice, usually taken to reduce the expenses incurred in effluent treatment. It is pointed out that as movements of water do not follow national boundaries, strict environmental standards in one nation are not effective to keep the waters of that nation clean, if other areas that are situated along the waterways have slack environmental standards. Accidental releases of contaminants are caused especially by malfunctioning wastewater-treatment plants, shipwrecks, and accidental spills in oil production. Such accidental spills are on the increase as more and more oil drilling takes place on oceanic coastal floors. In contamination by diffuse sources, agriculture plays the major role. To decrease agricultural contamination, safety zones near waterways and temporal planning of, for example, nutrient application, is important. Also, avoidance of excess fertilization, and technological advances in contaminant (nutrients and pesticides) application help in decreasing contamination. Once in the waterways, contaminants can travel long distances in rivers and on ocean currents. Airborne contaminants can be carried in air currents, and enter waterways as a result of rain.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-12-411581-1; 978-0-12-411574-3,,,,,,,,,"Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Physiol Anim Lab, SF-20500 Turku, Finland",,,,2014-10-15,WOS:000341814100005,,

Soil type was influential, with heavier soils having greater NEP earlier in the rotation than lighter, sandier soils, although these differences disappeared by the rotation end. Climate had only a small effect. Stand age had the largest effect, with simulated annual NEP strongly negative during the first 5 to 8 years of development but peaking at +600 g Cm-2 a(-1) by age 13. Modest declines in NEP after 13 years were associated with declines in LAI as stands aged. The 30-year mean annual NEP was positive over most of the study area but in a few cases was indistinguishable from zero for northwestern portions of the study. Simulated annual NPP rose from zero to over 2300 g biomass m(-2) a(-1) by age 12, after which it declined to similar to 1700 g biomass m(-2) a(-1) by rotation end. These results suggest that loblolly pine plantations on the Coastal Plain of Virginia may become net annual C sinks 5 to 9 years after planting but that when averaged over a whole rotation the net carbon accumulation during the baseline rotation simulated here is indistinguishable from zero.

Spar dynamics exhibits a highly nonlinear behavior due to the presence of various components such as mooring lines, moonpool, and risers. Certain studies have focused on the reduction of the heave response of single-degree-of-freedom Spar models due to the oscillations of water entrapped in the moonpool through the partially closed bottom plates. In this paper, a novel coupled six-degree-of-freedom analytical model of a Spar system comprising top tensioned risers is proposed. The model accounts for the interactions among the Spar hull kinematics (heave, surge, and pitch), the riser kinematics (heave and surge), and the moonpool. This model involves six coupled differential equations comprising nonlinearities associated not only with stiffness and damping but also with inertia terms. A dynamic analysis is performed by subjecting the model to JONSWAP ocean wave spectrum compatible extreme forces (corresponding to the 100 year wave) and to moments applied to the center of gravity computed by means of a standard motion simulation program. Both numerical and analytical techniques (statistical linearization including inertia terms) are used for the determination of the response of the proposed dynamic model, both in the time and the frequency domains. Related parameter study results are reported, including ones pertaining to the dependence of the Spar system motion on the degree of opening of the bottom plates.

Droplets were simulated from a blowout at 2000 m depth and were either treated with sub-surface dispersant injection (2% dispersant to oil ratio) or untreated. The most important factor affecting oil fate was the size of the droplets, with biodegradation contributing substantially to the fate of droplets <= 0.5 mm.

Static, non-renewal 48 h acute toxicity tests were performed on stage-II blue crab zoea. The median lethal concentration (LC50) was calculated for each dispersant at 24 h and 48 h using nominal concentrations for each dispersant tested. The 48 h LC50 values from the most to the least toxic ranged from 10.1 mg L-1 for Dispersit SPC 1000 to 76.5 mg L-1 for Orca. For all dispersants, the swimming activity and mobility of larvae decreased with increasing dispersant concentration within 24 h of exposure and reached relative immobility at concentrations below LC50 values. These results show that the dispersants examined in this study are only slightly toxic after 48 h exposure to the earliest life stage of blue crabs that might likely be exposed to dispersants in the environment, with the exception of Dispersit SPC 1000 that bordered between slightly and moderately toxic. Although the dispersants themselves appear to not cause substantial acute toxicity, sublethal and potentially delayed impacts, such as, reduced mobility or food source availability could indirectly remove larvae from the population and need to be further examined, as do larval responses in standard chronic toxicity tests.

Reductions of carbon emissions to the atmosphere includes strategies to not only capture and store carbon emissions from, for example, coal fired power plants, but also includes strategies such as increasing energy efficiency, greater use of renewable energy sources, and greater use of fuels that do not contain carbon (such as nuclear) or are carbon-neutral. Over the next several centuries most or all of the earth's fossil fuel reserves (about 4000 Gt-C) may be consumed, with the hope that carbon capture and storage (CCS) will minimize future greenhouse gas emissions to levels that are not dangerous to the planet. However, as discussed in this paper, it may not be possible for repositories to reliably store the massive amounts of carbon generated without imposing environmental risks. Further, while control of global warming is of immediate concern, possibilities of other types of climate change exist. Abrupt changes could be triggered that, for example, might reduce the deep North Atlantic circulation and produce a cooling over much of the earth. Second, the earth has been in an interglacial warm period for over 10,000 years, and if the climate cycles observed in the previous 500,000 years continue, it is possible that the earth will return to a colder period. Ultimately, control of global cooling may be a more challenging problem than control of global warming.If reduction of greenhouse gas emissions turns out not to be the complete solution to climate change mitigation requirements (which may involve both warming and cooling periods), what is? In this paper, earth-based and space-based techniques are explored that are designed to supplement greenhouse gas reduction approaches. While the strategies presented here may be futuristic and expensive, they do provide us with an outlook on controlling global climate change that may spawn ideas for other mitigation techniques. General design considerations are presented based on a global energy balance model to predict global temperature changes not only in response to changing greenhouse gas concentrations, but also to changing conditions in the earth system, such as the net incoming solar radiation or the planetary albedo. The approaches are intended to perturb the earth's energy balance in a controllable manner. Today, for example, data show that the earth is not in an equilibrium energy state. About 1.0 W/m(2) more energy is coming into the earth than is leaving, indicating that the earth is '' committed '' to this amount of global warming and its attendant consequences, even if greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere do not continue to increase. This energy imbalance is equivalent to a further warming of 0.5 degrees C to 1 degrees C, comparable to the observed global warming that has occurred over the past century. One benefit of the supplemental mitigation techniques would be to help '' uncommit '' earth from such energy imbalances, as well as to provide a basis for addressing future climate change.",,,,,IEEE EIC Climate Change ConferenceIEEE EIC Climate Change Conference,"MAY 09-12, 2006MAY 09-12, 2006",IEEEIEEE,"Ottawa, CANADAOttawa, CANADA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-1-4244-0217-5,,,,,,,,,"Tetra Tech Inc Res & Dev, 3746 Mt Diablo Blvd,Suite 300, Lafayette, CA 94549 USA",Tetra Tech Inc Res & Dev,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000247356600012,,

Many measures have been taken to adopt molecular and biotechnological approaches that lead to the development of transgenic plants able to deal with such harsh and polluted environments. However, such solutions could be very expensive and require considerable efforts and time to achieve these objectives. The main objective of this review is to discuss the new biological solutions that have emerged in the last decade, as environmentally friendly approaches, perhaps to support and/or replace the present efforts. These solutions based on plant-microbe interactions could be a lifeline and promising alternative strategy to create plants with a high resistance to the extreme environments.MethodsDuring the last two decades research projects have been conducted to study the ecology, identify the features, and the ecophysiology of native plants and the associated microorganisms in the Arabian Gulf region and particularly in Qatar. Many physiological and biochemical parameters have been determined, including organic solutes (amino acids like proline, glycinebetaine, soluble sugars, etc.), photosynthetic pigments, organic acids and inorganic ions especially heavy metals, along with the physical and chemical properties of the soil in various locations of the State of Qatar. Also, the microorganisms adjacent to and associated with these native plants were identified to elucidate the possible roles in the soil biota in supporting these plants against extreme environmental conditions.Important FindingsInvestigations of native plants in the Arabian Gulf states during the last decade have shown that wild plants exhibit different abilities to accumulate organic solutes to cope with the harsh natural environments. Pollution is a major factor stressing wildlife in this region due to the expansion of urban sectors and industrial activities of oil and gas. Compatible osmolytes, like proline, accumulate in wild plants in response to severe environmental conditions and heavy metal contaminated soil. Accumulation of these solutes in plant tissues could provide some level of adaptation and resistance against all these types of environmental stresses. We present some promising efforts in the Arabian Gulf region to remediate desert soil and water polluted with heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons. Substantial evidence is introduced about the roles of microorganisms associated with wild plants in natural habitats, such association may help them cope with the extreme stresses. Possible mechanisms adopted by microorganisms in alleviating the harsh abiotic stresses facing the wild life are discussed, one of which is the promotion of biosynthesis and transport of organic solutes to the plants. Also, the main possibilities of the origin of activities of the accumulation of compatible organic solutes are suggested and the objectives of the future research are discussed.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,7,0,7,,,1752-9921,1752-993X,,,,,,,,,,"Qatar Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Doha, Qatar8 James Court,Dunstable Rd, Luton LU4 0HN, Beds, England",,,,2019-01-30,WOS:000456052800001,,

We find that global replacement of current vegetation by trees would lead to a global mean warming of 1.3 degrees C, nearly 60% of the warming produced under a doubled CO2 concentration, while replacement by grasslands would result in a cooling of 0.4 degrees C. It has been previously shown that boreal forestation can lead to warming; our simulations indicate that mid-latitude forestation also could lead to warming.

Macronutrient fertilisation has been calculated, for a particular scenario, to cost US$20 per tonne of carbon dioxide emission avoided for 100 years.Research limitations/implications - There is a collateral benefit of increased fish stocks, which is not considered here. The ocean, plausibly, has the capacity to sequester more than one Gigatonne per year of carbon (similar to 3.7 Gt CO2/yr) via macronutrient fertilisation.Practical implications - This modest cost of reducing climate change justifies further research and development of ocean macronutrient fertilisation.Social implications - The modest cost allows climate change to be addressed without serious economic disruption.Originality/value - The study reported is a contribution to mitigation of climate change.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,0,12,,,1756-8692,1756-8706,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sydney, Ocean Technol Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,,,2015-01-07,WOS:000346110900004,,

A key requirement for low carbon pathways is to quantify the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies which will be strongly affected by carbon cycle feedbacks. Here we find that Earth system models suggest significant weakening, even potential reversal, of the ocean and land sinks under future low emission scenarios. For the RCP 2.6 concentration pathway, models project land and ocean sinks to weaken to 0.8 +/- 0.9 and 1.1 +/- 0.3 GtC yr(-1) respectively for the second half of the 21st century and to -0.4 +/- 0.4 and 0.1 +/- 0.2 GtC yr(-1) respectively for the second half of the 23rd century.

The overall response was led by the United States Coast Guard and involved the oil company BP, federal agencies, and state and local governments of five states.METHODS: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health focused extensive resources on ensuring that BP and its contractors provided safe working conditions for thousands of workers involved in the response. Federal personnel visited worksites daily, identifying hazards and means of abatement; assessed training programs to ensure that workers were adequately trained in languages they could understand; monitored chemical exposures and determined that the proper personal protective equipment was deployed; insisted on implementation of a heat mitigation program; rostered thousands of workers; and conducted extensive outreach in communities impacted by the spill.RESULTS: Advance planning, immediate deployment, and collaboration across agencies helped ensure that the response operations resulted in no worker fatalities, and relatively few injuries and illnesses.CONCLUSIONS: For future responses, improvements should be made in how safety and health information, as well as the process behind safety and health decisions, are communicated to the public.CITATION: Michaels D, Howard J.

When merged with ship registers and other data sources, it enables unprecedented accuracy in modelling and geographical allocation of emissions and discharges. This paper presents results using two of the models in the framework; emissions of black carbon (BC) in the Arctic, which is of particular concern for climate change, and; bunker fuels and wet bulk carriage in the Arctic, of particular concern for oil spill to the environment. Using the framework, a detailed footprint from Arctic shipping with regards to operational emissions and potential discharges is established. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Study of the synergistic effect of using rhamnolipid and co-culture of yeast with Pseudomonas putida ATCC 12633 revealed that the combination of both of them with B. persicus increased 21% pyrene elimination. The findings of this study can be used to comprehend the mechanisms of oil hydrocarbon degradation by yeasts. Furthermore, the results demonstrated the promising potential of yeast-bacteria co-culture for cleaning of oil spills in marine and saline soil contaminated areas.",,,,,,,,,31,1,0,0,20,1,32,,,0147-6513,1090-2414,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tehran, Coll Sci, Sch Biol, Dept Microbial Biotechnol, Tehran, Iran",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000443104400055,30075450,

This information shapes the way decisions are made as to how soil resources are assessed and managed. This paper proposes a novel method for whole-soil profile predictions (to 1 m) across user-defined study areas where limited soil information exists. Using the Edgeroi district in north-western NSW as the test site, we combined equal-area spline depth functions with digital soil mapping techniques to predict the vertical and lateral variations of carbon storage and available water capacity (AWC) across the 1500 km(2) area. Neural network models were constructed for both soil attributes to model their relationship with a suite of environmental factors derived from a digital elevation model, radiometric data and Landsat imagery. Subsequent fits of the models resulted in an R-2 of 44% for both carbon and AWC. For validation at selected model depths, R-2 values ranged between 20 and 27% for carbon prediction (RMSE: 0.30-0.52 log (kg/m(3))) and between 8 and 29% for AWC prediction (RMSE: 0.01 m/m). Visually, reconstruction of splines at selected validation data points indicated an average fit with raw data values. In order to improve upon our model and validation results there is a need to address some of the structural and metrical uncertainties identified in this study. Nevertheless, the resulting geo-database of quantitative soil information describing its spatial and vertical variations is an example of what can be generated with this proposed methodology. We also demonstrate the functionality of this geo-database in terms of data enquiry for user-defined queries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, the lumbering of the original forests of the Midsouth region of the United States of America, coupled with the accelerating conversion of unmanaged natural-origin stands to loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations, make quantifying historic biomass difficult. If carefully done, it is possible to estimate presettlement biomass from past references and modern-day old pine-hardwood remnants. Pine sawtimber-only volume estimates from old reports indicated low biomass in the virgin pine-dominated forests of the Midsouth, from as little as 10-14 Mg/ha up to 72 Mg/ha. Given the incompleteness of these lumber yield-only data, a set of more detailed stand table-based historic descriptions were then coupled in this study with modern allometric equations to produce more complete estimates of biomass. These suggested that presettlement pine-hardwood stands of this region averaged similar to 112 Mg/ha in total (above- and below-ground) live tree biomass (range = 54-171 Mg/ha; n = 6 stands). Contemporary old forests are considerably better stocked, with an estimated 224-318 Mg/ha (n = 6 stands). Individual loblolly pines from the historic period reached 183 cm in diameter and may have had as much as 32 Mg of biomass, though specimens <6 Mg were considerably more common. Large individual tree values but low stand levels imply disturbance (especially fire) regulated total tree biomass in historic forests of the Midsouth. These results further indicate that extensive restoration of modern unmanaged forests to past stand structures will likely decrease regional biomass.

In an effort to develop a new indicator of water salinity we will build on recent experimental results indicating that hydrogen isotope fractionation in algal lipids decreases as salinity increases. Intellectual Merit: Motivated by a recent report by Schouten et al. (2006) that salinity altered hydrogen isotope fractionation in lipids from cultured coccolithophorid algae, and the prospect this finding raises for paleosalinity and paleohydrologic reconstructions, investigators propose to test the generality of a salinity influence on lipid D/H fractionation in a variety of algal, microbial and archaeal lipids in a wide diversity of natural saline systems with salinities between 0.4 - 277 ppt. Their initial results from Christmas Island and the Chesapeake Bay support the hypothesis of Schouten et al. (2006) that D/H fractionation in algal and microbial lipids decreases with increasing salinity. At Christmas Island they find a strong inverse correlation between salinity and lipid D/H fractionation in several algal and bacterial biomarkers and total lipid extracts over the salinity range 17 - 149 ppt . In the Chesapeake Bay they observe a strong inverse relationship between salinity and D/H fractionation in the dinoflagellate lipid dinosterol at salinities between 8 - 31 ppt. The proposed study will use water, particulate and surface sediment samples from 39 globally dispersed saline basins in Canada, the USA, Bolivia, Israel, South Africa, Kazhakstan, and the Galapagos Islands. This highly diverse set of lakes was chosen to span the widest possible range of salinities, limnologies, water chemistries, and climates. They will measure the δD values of several different lipid biomarkers from algae (e.g., dinosterol, highly branched isoprenoid alkenes, fucoxanthin, botryococcenes), bacteria (e.g., diploptene, hopanoids, bacteriochlorophyll a-e) and archaea (glycerol-dialkyl-glycerol-tetraethers) in suspended particles and surface sediments in each lake, and compare those values to the δD values of lake water. They possess all samples for this study. Broader Impacts: This project will support a female graduate student and facilitate the education of undergraduate and high school students in environmental research. Of 11 lab members, 5 are women, 4 are undergraduates and 1 is in high school. Two undergraduates, along with the PI, conducted the fieldwork to collect the saline lake samples for this project in June 2007. Their website describing their research receives over 700 hits per day. And the PI has been a science judge in 6 national high school science competitions during the last 8 years.

While we know that desert dust is sensitive to perturbations in climate and human land use, previous studies have been unable to determine whether humans were increasing or decreasing desert dust in the global average. Here we present observational estimates of desert dust based on paleodata proxies showing a doubling of desert dust during the 20th century over much, but not all the globe. Large uncertainties remain in estimates of desert dust variability over 20th century due to limited data. Using these observational estimates of desert dust change in combination with ocean, atmosphere and land models, we calculate the net radiative effect of these observed changes (top of atmosphere) over the 20th century to be -0.14 +/- 0.11 W/m(2) (1990-1999 vs. 1905-1914). The estimated radiative change due to dust is especially strong between the heavily loaded 1980-1989 and the less heavily loaded 1955-1964 time periods (-0.57 +/- 0.46 W/m(2)), which model simulations suggest may have reduced the rate of temperature increase between these time periods by 0.11 degrees C. Model simulations also indicate strong regional shifts in precipitation and temperature from desert dust changes, causing 6 ppm (12 PgC) reduction in model carbon uptake by the terrestrial biosphere over the 20th century. Desert dust carries iron, an important micronutrient for ocean biogeochemistry that can modulate ocean carbon storage; here we show that dust deposition trends increase ocean productivity by an estimated 6% over the 20th century, drawing down an additional 4 ppm (8 PgC) of carbon dioxide into the oceans. Thus, perturbations to desert dust over the 20th century inferred from observations are potentially important for climate and biogeochemistry, and our understanding of these changes and their impacts should continue to be refined.",,,,,,,,,300,6,1,0,68,0,340,,,1680-7316,1680-7324,,,,,,,,,,"Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USAUniv Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USAHarvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USADesert Res Inst, Div Hydrol Sci, Reno, NV 89512 USAUniv Milano Bicocca, Dept Environm Sci, I-20126 Milan, ItalyWoods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USAAustralian Antarctic Div, Kingston, Tas 7050, AustraliaAntarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas 7001, AustraliaUniv Michigan, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Space Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USAOak Ridge Natl Lab, Computat Earth Sci Grp, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USANatl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Div, Boulder, CO 80307 USAUniv Maine, Climate Change Inst, Orono, ME 04469 USAUniv Colorado, Dept Geosci, Boulder, CO 80301 USAUniv Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80301 USABritish Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000284759500011,,

The pipeline structure is affected by different environmental forces from the surrounding conditions such as the external uniform hydrostatic pressure, hydrodynamic pressure, seismic forces, installation forces, free span forces, and forces scouring the pipeline. These conditions cause the pipeline to express complicated behavior.Local buckling and buckling propagation along the pipeline are common examples of collapses under these conditions and loadings, which can destroy thousands of meters of pipeline. These post-buckling phenomena cause great damage and losses to the oil and gas industries and to the environment; the imposed costs for the repair and protection of pipelines and mitigation of environmental problems are high. The use of ring-stiffeners is one way of increasing the budding capacity of a pipeline in order to prevent and control the buckling propagation in pipelines.In this study, the budding and post-buckling behaviors of ring-stiffened pipelines were investigated at a small scale through experiments and the finite element method (FEM). Two different ring-stiffeners were attached to the specimens. Only the uniform hydrostatic pressure was considered as the main loading; the axial stress was neglected in this study. The budding modes, lateral displacement of the pipeline, ring tilt, formation of yielding lines, and torsion of yielding lines were examined. The results indicated that increasing the number of ring-stiffeners greatly increases the buckling capacity and lateral displacement of the pipeline. The buckling modes were changed, the post-buckling region was shortened, and torsion in the yielding lines and tilting in the ring-stiffeners clearly appeared in the tests. The results of this study were compared with those of recent research and reliable guidelines and standards. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Phenomenal classes derive their identity from real world phenomena like events or things and declarative classes derive their identity from human declarations like dates or coordinates. This differentiation is an essential conceptual background to link CIDOC CRM to the classes, topological relations and encodings provided by Geo-SPARQL and thus allowing spatiotemporal analysis offered by geoinformation systems based on the semantic distinctions of the CIDOC CRM. CRMgeo introduces the classes and relations necessary to model the spatiotemporal properties of real world phenomena and their topological and semantic relations to spatiotemporal information about these phenomena that was derived from historic sources, maps, observations or measurements.

J,,,,,,,,,Pelin Demirel,,Innovating for a Low Carbon Economy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Feb 05 2015,2015,"The UK government has committed to reduce the country's green house gas (GHG) emissions by 80% by 2050. It is, now, widely acknowledged that this transition to a low carbon economy is unlikely to occur unless radical changes take place on the policy and technology fronts as well as within the organisational structures and how companies see their relationship with the environment. Yet, the presence of various market failures dominate the scene and as a result, many radical low carbon innovations (including photovoltaic systems, offshore wind and carbon capture and storage projects) will not efficiently materialise unless there is a better coordination within the private sector driven by an efficient environmental and innovation policy; as well as significant public support. Academic evidence on the risks and returns of environmental innovations, their drivers and barriers as well as the general understanding on green innovation system dynamics is rather new and patchy; at times failing to produce clear directions for policy makers. Moreover, environmental private sector innovators raise concerns about the lack of clarity in policy signals and the economic challenges of commercialising their innovations.In order for the UK to meet its commitments to reduce GHG emissions, a clear road map for the transition to a low carbon economy is urgently required. While general directions are outlined in the Low Carbon Strategy (BIS, 2011); a thorough and detailed understanding of the specific needs and challenges in UK's environmental innovation system is much required to address effectively the pollution reduction targets. Through this seminar series, we aim to facilitate communication between three important stakeholders; private sector, policy makers from UK and EU, and academics from the economics, management, social marketing as well as engineering and physics disciplines. The main goal is to enable discussions about potential problems and solutions to GHG reduction, by facilitating a platform for exchange of information which can, then, be fed into a detailed road map for UK's low carbon economy in the form of concrete suggestions.The proposed seminar series consists of six seminars. The first two seminars concentrate on the technological and organisational environmental innovations in order to explore the characteristics of UK's environmental innovations while the following two seminars focus on the central role of government policies and the public's consumption attitudes toward environmental matters. In the final two seminars, we respectively investigate the role and characteristics of the environmental sector's SME section in driving the UK's clean technology innovations and the financing needs of the environmental sector. The seminars and their time frame are as follows: 1. Technological innovations for transitioning to a low carbon economy (December 2013)2. Organisational innovations for transitioning to a low carbon economy (March 2014)3. The green revolution and entrepreneurial state (July 2014)4. Driving consumer demand for green products and services (September 2014)5. Supporting SMEs in transitioning to a low carbon economy (December 2014)6. Financing environmental innovations (July 2015)It is aimed that the network created through the organisation of this seminar series will be the basis for a strong network and community that will generate future research projects stemming from these outlined topics. Such a network is crucial for pushing the boundaries of research in this field and it can channel academic research to support policy decisions and company actions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,ES/L000628/2,,,,,,,,University of Southampton,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15343453,,

Over 18 months of operational data from two plants, ope rating in distinctly different catchments, processing an average of between 2,000 and 2,500 m(3)/d of wastewater, has clearly shown the efficacy and robustness of the ESI SBR-BNR process. Median effluent total nitrogen and total phosphorus values of 3 mg/L and <0.6 mg/L, respectively, were demonstrated over the 18-month period. This high level of nutrient removal is attributed to the design of the bio-selector which maximises carbon storage for the subsequent denitrification reactions, the effective aeration control which ensures no over-aeration during the air-on cycle as well as-the level of operational control provided at these two plants.",,,,,3rd IWA Conference on Sequencing Batch Reactor Technology3rd IWA Conference on Sequencing Batch Reactor Technology,"FEB 22-26, 2004FEB 22-26, 2004",Int Water Assoc; Australian Water Assoc; Adv Wastewater Management Ctr; Univ QueenslandInt Water Assoc; Australian Water Assoc; Adv Wastewater Management Ctr; Univ Queensland,"Noosa, AUSTRALIANoosa, AUSTRALIA",9,0,0,0,6,0,9,,,0273-1223,,,,,,,,,,,"Environm Solut Int Ltd, Burswood, WA 6100, Australia",Environm Solut Int Ltd,,,2004-01-01,WOS:000226128100016,15656303,

We studied four 15 x 15 km sample areas to examine land management and wildfire effects on carbon storage dynamics in the forested southeastern U.S. coastal plain region from 1975 to 2001. Carbon exchange and storage rates were estimated using satellite remote-sensing methods coupled with micrometeorological and biomass measurements. Carbon losses occurred by timber harvesting and fire, and carbon release continued for four years following clearing, suppressing landscape carbon gain proportional to the cleared area. Carbon accumulated at an average rate of 90,000 t C yr(-1) in the landscape (total area 900 km(2)) from 1975-2000, or similar to 1 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Interannual variation was related mainly to the magnitude of annual plantation timber harvesting. Wildfires were rare and their effects on carbon balances consequently small, despite having large local impact. Previous studies in the area demonstrated that environmental fluctuations had little direct effect on the net landscape exchange of carbon, although indirect effects included higher probability of fire during droughts and shifts in harvesting to drier sites during wet periods. Although this study was a simple aggregation of carbon cycle components from fine spatial scale (Landsat images) to the landscape, the extrapolation incorporated important spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneities and led to the unexpected suggestion that the industrial forests of the southeast U. S. Coastal plain are a long-term carbon sink.

It is, now, widely acknowledged that this transition to a low carbon economy is unlikely to occur unless radical changes take place on the policy and technology fronts as well as within the organisational structures and how companies see their relationship with the environment. Yet, the presence of various market failures dominate the scene and as a result, many radical low carbon innovations (including photovoltaic systems, offshore wind and carbon capture and storage projects) will not efficiently materialise unless there is a better coordination within the private sector driven by an efficient environmental and innovation policy; as well as significant public support. Academic evidence on the risks and returns of environmental innovations, their drivers and barriers as well as the general understanding on green innovation system dynamics is rather new and patchy; at times failing to produce clear directions for policy makers. Moreover, environmental private sector innovators raise concerns about the lack of clarity in policy signals and the economic challenges of commercialising their innovations.In order for the UK to meet its commitments to reduce GHG emissions, a clear road map for the transition to a low carbon economy is urgently required. While general directions are outlined in the Low Carbon Strategy (BIS, 2011); a thorough and detailed understanding of the specific needs and challenges in UK's environmental innovation system is much required to address effectively the pollution reduction targets. Through this seminar series, we aim to facilitate communication between three important stakeholders; private sector, policy makers from UK and EU, and academics from the economics, management, social marketing as well as engineering and physics disciplines. The main goal is to enable discussions about potential problems and solutions to GHG reduction, by facilitating a platform for exchange of information which can, then, be fed into a detailed road map for UK's low carbon economy in the form of concrete suggestions.The proposed seminar series consists of six seminars. The first two seminars concentrate on the technological and organisational environmental innovations in order to explore the characteristics of UK's environmental innovations while the following two seminars focus on the central role of government policies and the public's consumption attitudes toward environmental matters. In the final two seminars, we respectively investigate the role and characteristics of the environmental sector's SME section in driving the UK's clean technology innovations and the financing needs of the environmental sector. The seminars and their time frame are as follows: 1. Technological innovations for transitioning to a low carbon economy (December 2013)2. Organisational innovations for transitioning to a low carbon economy (March 2014)3. The green revolution and entrepreneurial state (July 2014)4. Driving consumer demand for green products and services (September 2014)5. Supporting SMEs in transitioning to a low carbon economy (December 2014)6. Financing environmental innovations (July 2015)It is aimed that the network created through the organisation of this seminar series will be the basis for a strong network and community that will generate future research projects stemming from these outlined topics. Such a network is crucial for pushing the boundaries of research in this field and it can channel academic research to support policy decisions and company actions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,ES/L000628/1,,,,,,,,University of Nottingham,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15364023,,

Natural gas is coproduced with water from the subsurface forming gas hydrates. Hydrate formation may result in shutdown of onshore and offshore operations. Industry practice has been usage of alcohols-which have undesirable environmental impacts-to affect bulk-phase properties and inhibit hydrate formation. An alternative to alcohols is changing the surface properties through usage of polymers and surfactants, effective at 0.5-3 wt % of coproduced water. One group of low-dosage hydrate inhibitors (LDHI) are kinetic inhibitors, which affect nucleation rate and growth. A second group of LDHI are anti-agglomerants, which prevent agglomeration of small hydrate crystallites. Despite great potential, reported work on hydrate anti-agglomeration is very limited. In this paper, our focus is on the use of two vastly different surfactants As anti - agglomerants. We use a model oil, water, and tetrahydrofuran as a hydrate-forming species. We examine the effectiveness of a quaternary ammonium salt (i.e., quat). Visual observation measurements show that a small concentration of the quat (0.01%) can prevent agglomeration. However, a quat is not a green chemical and therefore may be undesirable. We show that a rhamnolipid biosurfactant can be effective to a concentration of 0.05 wt %. One difference between the two surfactants is the stability of the water-in-oil emulsions created. The biosurfactant forms a less stable emulsion, which makes it very desirable for hydrate application.",,,,,,,,,45,4,0,0,5,0,55,,,1520-6106,,,,,,,,,,,"Yale Univ, Mason Lab, Dept Chem Engn, New Haven, CT 06520 USAReservoir Engn Res Inst, Palo Alto, CA 94306 USA",Reservoir Engn Res Inst,,,2008-01-24,WOS:000252484200026,18171051,

Elemental speciation is important because, for many elements, properties such as toxicity or nutrient value, mobility, and volatility, depend on the species or chemical form of the element present in the environment. A multidisciplinary group of faculty members from the Environmental Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Agriculture, Agribusiness, and Environmental Sciences departments at Texas A&M University-Kingsville (TAMUK) will conduct research, educational, and outreach activities using the LC-ICP-MS instrument. TAMUK is a Minority Serving Institution and is the only institution with an Environmental Engineering Ph.D. program in South Texas. This project will allow preparing STEM students, particularly Hispanic, with skills in conducting high quality and competitive research in critical interdisciplinary environmental areas. This project will allow TAMUK to attract inter-institutional research and education collaboration from other institutions in South Texas, particularly Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi (TAMUCC) and the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), since no other institution in the region possesses a hyphenated instrument for species identification and quantification and multi-element determination. This project will directly impact the research expertise of graduate and undergraduate Hispanic students at TAMUK and other research/educational institutions in South Texas. It is anticipated that more than 150 graduate students at TAMUK will become involved in laboratory-activities related to the instrument over the three years of the grant. Due to the strategic location of TAMUK in South Texas, the potential for international and interdisciplinary experiences for students exists, which will create a broader spectrum for future global collaboration. For this purpose, summer research exchange programs between institutions at the U.S.-México border will be promoted. This project will advance knowledge on speciation reactions that metal ions undergo in environmental systems due to natural and anthropogenic causes. This project is divided in seven sub-projects that will allow identifying problematic ion species present in a broad range of environments, as well as determining how to negate the toxicity and mitigate the effect of these ions species on the environment. The objectives of the sub-projects are to 1) determine the adsorption of As(III)/As(V) from brackish groundwater on manganese oxide-modified natural zeolite (MCZ); 2) conduct a comparative study of the aqueous-phase adsorption of sulfamethazine (SMN) onto powdered activated carbons in the presence of heavy metal ions; 3) evaluate alternative inorganic reductants for stimulating autotrophic reduction and immobilization of uranium (VI) at in-situ recovery mining sites; 4) conduct element speciation analysis of trace metal- and metalloid-containing compounds, such as vanadium (V), nickel (Ni), mercury (Hg/Hg(II)), arsenic (As(III)/As(V)), and sulfur (S/S(II)/S(III)), in petroleum-related materials; 5) conduct an assessment of nutrient foliar spray impact on citrus production; 6) evaluate the reduction of combustion flue gas emissions of mercury by enhanced oxidation with hydrogen peroxide; and 7) determine the immobilization of homogeneous catalysts for atom economical alkene and alkyne functionalization. The LC-ICP-MS instrument will be used by the sub-projects to 1) quantify the transformation of As(III) into As(V) species during the adsorption on MCZ; 2) quantify arsenic, antimony and copper on the adsorption of SMN onto powder activated carbon materials; 3) quantify uranyl-carbonate concentrations by using inorganic or organic reductants; 4) analyze vanadium (V), nickel (Ni), mercury (Hg/Hg(II)), arsenic (As(III)/As(V)), and sulfur (S/S(II)/S(III)) speciation in collected crude oil and gas condensate samples from the Eagle Ford Shale; 5) measure chelated elements, such as Ca, B, Cu, and Si that will be applied as foliar sprays to young grapefruit leaves; 6) provide a more distinct separation of mercury species and increase the analytical precision, resulting in better reproducibility and optimization of experimental runtimes; and 7) monitor possible catalyst leaching effects from reaction solutions immobilized by an alkyl tether on isotactic-propylene/hexane copolymer or silica. Results from the sub-projects will 1) provide an alternative method to remove and mitigate As species that have potential health effects and that have been found in fresh water aquifers in the Gulf Coast of Texas; 2) allow mitigate the environmental impact of antimicrobial SMN drug released to the environmental through excretion by cattle and swine; 3) provide a process for groundwater restoration at uranium in-situ recovery (ISR) sites in South Texas; 4) allow understanding the role that species have on catalyst poisoning mechanisms; 5) allow developing new management practices and guidelines for growing crops that are better adapted to abiotic and biotic stresses in the Lower Rio Grande Valley; 6) help implement enhanced oxidation with hydrogen peroxide to produce soluble species of mercury that can be removed by absorption from scrubbers in power plants; and 7) provide insight into atom economical processes, which do not generate any waste products and are therefore of great importance for industrial applications.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1626157,,,,,,,,Texas A&M University-Kingsville,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13500148,,

The relative binding energy of oil molecule is larger on modified calcite. MgSO4 surface than on pure calcite surface, providing an indication of less oil wet calcite surface. Ab initio molecular results also show that few Na+ ions of sea water reach to the calcite surface as a precipitate and form Na naphthenates that make oil molecule more sticker (more oil-wet) to the rock surface.

With rapidly increasing world population, portable water will be one of the most important technological challenges of this century. There is no unique ?one size fits all? approach to desalination. Many factors such as salt concentration, the presence of specific ions, energy cost, pretreatment requirements and capital investments are important considerations in selecting the desalination technology to be implemented. The carbon nanotube enhanced membrane distillation proposed here is a relatively low temperature process where industrial waste heat and solar heating can be used for desalination. Small water heaters such as the natural gas heaters used in homes can be used to generate high quality drinking water along with what is needed for domestic consumption. Another major application of this technology is in oil and gas drilling. Hydraulic fracturing or fracking is a water-intensive process. A typical frack well uses several million gallons of water over its lifetime and generates a highly saline ?produced water?. With its ability to handle high salt concentrations, the proposed approach is a viable alternative for treating this waste. The technical objectives in this project are to utilize carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to create breakthrough membrane properties for desalination via membrane distillation (MD). In MD, a hydrophobic porous membrane separates a hot salt water feed and a cold permeate stream. As the heated brine passes on the membrane and is partially transformed to water vapor. The hydrophobicity of the membrane prevents the aqueous solution from entering the pores. However, freed from hydrogen bonding the water vapor passes through and is condensed on the permeate side of the membrane. The novel membranes referred to as carbon nanotube immobilized membranes (CNIM) will be developed by immobilizing CNTs into membrane pores where they will serve as molecular transporters and sorbents, thus providing additional pathways for water vapor transport. The other major advantage of CNIM is that it is less prone to fouling than conventional membranes. Key innovations of the proposal include the functionalization of CNTs for maximization of water vapor transport while minimizing fouling.

Using echolocation detectors and noise recorders, we investigated harbour porpoise behavioural responses to piling noise during the 10-month foundation installation of a North Sea windfarm. Current UK guidance assumes total displacement within 26 km of pile driving. In contrast, we recorded a 50 % probability of response within 7.4 km (95 % CI = 5.7 - 9.4) at the first location piled, decreasing to 1.3 km (95 % CI = 0.2 - 2.8) by the final location; representing 28 % (95 % CI = 21 - 35) and 18 % (95 % CI = 13 - 23) displacement of individuals within 26 km. Distance proved as good a predictor of responses as audiogram weighted received levels, presenting a more practicable variable for environmental assessments. Critically, acoustic deterrent device (ADD) use and vessel activity increased response levels. Policy and management to minimise impacts of renewables on cetaceans have concentrated on pile-driving noise. Our results highlight the need to consider trade-offs between efforts to reduce far-field behavioural disturbance and near-field injury through ADD use.

Understanding changes in soil fluxes induced by elevated atmospheric CO2 is critical for balancing the global C budget and for managing grassland ecosystems sustainably. In this review, we use the results of short-term (1-2 years) studies of below-ground processes in grassland communities under elevated CO2 to assess future prospects for longer-term increases in soil C storage.Results are broadly consistent with those from other plant communities and include: increases in below-ground net primary productivity and an increase in soil C cycling rate, changes in soil faunal community, and generally no increase in soil C storage. Based on other experimental data, future C storage could be favoured in soils of moderate nutrient status, moderate-to-high clay content, and low (or moderately high) soil moisture status. Some support for these suggestions is provided by preliminary results from direct measurements of soil C concentrations near a New Zealand natural CO2-venting spring, and by simulations of future changes in grassland soils under the combined effects of CO2 fertilization and regional climate change.Early detection of any increase in soil C storage appears unlikely in complex grassland communities because of (a) the difficulty of separating an elevated CO2 effect from the effects of soil factors including moisture status, (b) the high spatial variability of soil C and (c) the effects of global warming. Several research imperatives are identified for reducing the uncertainties in the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on soil C.",,,,,,,,,39,4,0,0,16,1,45,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1997-06-01,WOS:A1997XF04800007,,

As ecological interpretations have become increasingly central to twenty-first-century literary studies, calls have emerged to move beyond the green toward a more variegated spectrum of environmental alternatives. What Jeffrey Jerome Cohen calls ecology's rainbow refers to a current goal of the environmental humanities-to pluralize thinking about the relationship between human beings and nonhuman nature. My work in this area has flowed out of oceanic or blue ecologies, but the logic of dynamic ecological thinking cannot stop at the water's edge. The need to multiply ecocritical models responds to an increasing recognition, which began in the ecological sciences and has emerged in the humanities and social sciences more recently, that natural systems are more dynamic and less stable than once believed. The logic that moves from stasis and sustainability to dynamic post-equilibrium models requires that we match the constant innovations of natural systems with flexible interpretive practices. With this pressure toward dynamism in mind, this essay reconsiders green-but not the old green. Remembering that green is an oceanic as well as terrestrial color, and using a famously opaque phrase from Macbeth as a linguistic cue to re-introduce complexity into our literary models of natural systems, this essay offers immersion in hostile waters as a structure within which to think about the human encounter with nonhuman nature. In this model, it is no longer a question of being green, but of enduring, with effort and difficulty, inside the green one. By analyzing a key line from Macbeth, an episode of near-shipwreck in a seventeenth-century sailor's diary, and the moment when the hero washes ashore in Robinson Crusoe, this article discovers the myriad meanings of oceanic green.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1531-0485,1553-3786,,,,,,,,,,"St Johns Univ, English, New York, NY 11439 USA",,,,2013-06-01,WOS:000213709900004,,

The perturbation of the carbon cycle, and other aspects of global biogeochemical cycle, is so large and fundamental that it has been suggested the Earth has entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, characterised by overwhelming human perturbation of global biogeochemistry. Understanding and managing the effects of this perturbation are likely to be amongst the most pressing issues of the twenty first century. However, the present-day carbon cycle is still poorly understood. One remarkable feature is that an increasing amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide appears to be being absorbed by terrestrial vegetation.In this paper I review the recent evidence for the magnitude and spatial distribution of this terrestrial carbon sink, drawing on (i) current; research on the global atmospheric distribution and transport of carbon dioxide, oxygen and their isotopes (ii) direct measurement of CO(2) fluxes above various biomes, and (iii) inventories of forest biomass and composition. I review the likely causes of these carbon sinks and sources, and their implications for the ecology and stability of these biomes.Finally, I examine prospects and key issues over coining decades. Controlling deforestation and managing forests has the potential to play a significant but limited part in reaching the goal of stabilising atmospheric CO(2) concentrations. However, there are likely limits to the amount of carbon storage possible in natural vegetation and in the long term terrestrial carbon storage may unstable to significant global warming, with the potential to accelerate rather than brake global warming.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1793-1827,,978-1-86094-761-2,,,,,,,,,"Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Dept Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 2JD, EnglandUniv Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000269438100002,,

From this data spatial and temporal variations in chlorophyll a concentrations have been mapped. The maps show the development of blooms in different areas of the estuary, through the spring and summer, in relation to tidal and weather conditions. In 1999 conditions were such that the spring bloom increased in intensity through a spring tide (maximum chlorophyll a 55 mg m(-3)), which coincided with calm weather with high light levels (irradiance).

The increase in exploration, production, and shipment of oil near the shores of Newfoundland poses an increasing risk of a potential oil spill.

So too are the risks that are faced in attempting to meet project and stakeholder goals. Not meeting such goals has even greater consequences as a result. Project execution from potential identification of its need through execution and in-service use to decommissioning requires project management processes and tools at all stages of this timeline. Today, global project management standards are being developed, Promulgated, taught, and applied. The reason is obvious. Project management is an essential function that is the single greatest means of assuring that a project is successful in meeting all objectives from cost to functionality. It also is the single greatest means of assuring that a party with a role in the project execution (developer, owner-employer, engineer-constructor, contractor-subcontractor, vendor, operator-User, etc.) achieves its commercial, professional, and related goals. Project management is the most widely found cause for failure to meet project objectives and goals. Within today's project management bodies of knowledge, risk management techniques are evolving as a key tool to maximize achievement of goals, yet application of risk management in pipeline projects is not focused on a broad spectrum of the risks being experienced throughout the project. Ultimately, risk management application provides the ability to identify risks, determine characteristics of risk emergence, allow measurement through control systems, and apply enhanced project management methods for improved achievement of project and stakeholder goals throughout the life of a pipeline project. Risk management is essential to recognize and develop input to meet the different needs for the project and respective stakeholders' Success throughout the seasons of a pipeline project's life-a project's spring season (from the identification of a possible need that may become a project to its financing/funding), a project's summer season (project execution), a project's fall season (project use), and a project's winter season (sustainable recycling). This paper develops the types of risks for eight categories of risk factors being experienced, tools being used, application options and successes, and the contexts needed for Success. The basis for these approaches is the global project management experience of the writer over the last three decades, on six continents (on-shore and off-shore), including oil and gas, water, and wastewater.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,1,32,,,0742-597X,1943-5479,,,,,,,,,,"Nielsen Wurster Grp Inc, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Nielsen Wurster Grp Inc,,,2006-04-01,WOS:000236235100003,,

Proposals for new and recommissioned pipelines challenge host communities with uncertainty and difficult decisions about risk management. The appropriate community response depends on the risk level, the potential cost, and the prospect for compensation in the event of an incident. This article provides information on the risks and expected costs of pipeline leaks and explosions in the United States, including the incident rates, risk factors, and magnitude of harm. Although aggregated data on pipeline incidents are available, broadly inclusive data do not serve the needs of communities that must make critical decisions about hosting a pipeline for natural gas transmission.

Atriplex nummularia Lindl. is a perennial shrub commonly established for livestock forage on saline land, however, its potential for carbon mitigation has not been systematically evaluated. Similarly, although revegetation is an allowable activity to mitigate carbon within Article 3.4 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's Kyoto Protocol, there is a paucity of information on rates of carbon mitigation in soils and biomass through this mechanism. For six sites where A. nummularia had been established across southern Australia four were used to assess changes in soil carbon storage and four were used to develop biomass carbon sequestration estimates. A generalised allometric equation for above and below ground biomass was developed, with a simple crown volume index explaining 81% of the variation in total biomass. There were no significant differences in soil organic carbon storage to 0.3 m or 2 m depth compared to existing agricultural land-use. Between 2.2 and 8.3 Mg C ha(-1) or 0.2-0.6 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) was sequestered in above and below ground biomass and this translates to potential total sequestration of 1.1-3.6 Tg C yr(-1) on saline land across Australia.

Public preferences for energy policy play a role in determining energy futures, but researchers rarely simultaneously compare public views across multiple renewable and non-renewable energies or across country boundaries. Here, we used a 2019 online survey sample (n = 1500) to compare predictors of support for eight fuel sources for electricity generation in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington and Oregon, USA. Results indicate the highest support overall for renewables (wind, solar, wave/tidal energy, geothermal) and the lowest for fossil fuels (coal and natural gas), nuclear, and hydropower. Mixed-effects regression modeling indicates that views on climate and the balance between environment and economy were consistent predictors of support across most energy types, while political ideology was less consistent. Perceived local importance of both extractive and renewable energy industries were significant predictors of support for some, but not all, energy sources, as were education and gender.

In the early stage of independence of these countries, they continued to share the natural resources including water resources. Due to the climate change, water resources conflict among upstream and downstream countries took place. The upstream Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan possess rich water resources and hydropower resources, but they have few energy resources. The downstream Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are rich in energy resources such as oil, gas, but they faced with a severe water shortage. Since upstream countries are short of energy resources, they treat water resources as a strategic commodity.Tien Shan glacier of Central Asia was decreased into of one fourth of the total glacier area for the past 50 years because of climate change. Until 2050, half of the glacier will be gone. Tien Shan glacier water is very important water resources for the low level area such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan. As Aral sea is also dry up in recently, it had declined to only 10% of its original size. Salt lake, Aral sea, also has an effect on the breathing problem for the people and turns the land into salt surface. Only 70,000ha of forest has been remained out of 500,000ha of forestry. 18 species are already extinct out of 423 species and 50 species are facing extinction in the future.Central Asian countries have adopted several projects for improve water supply and water quality, or for implement Integrated Water Resources Management(IWRM). An agreement on attraction of Islamic Development Bank(IDB) funds(more than $300 million) was signed for implementation of two water conservancy projects in Kazakhstan(Almaty region). Under the first project on improving water supply, construction of water pipelines is planned in 15 locations, the total length of 680 kilometers. The second project “Reconstruction of the irrigation and drainage systems in the Republic of Kazakhstan” provides for the restoration of irrigation system in Almaty region and improvement of soil condition in South Kazakhstan region. This project will cost $ 235.5 million, and UNDP funds will be involved as co-financing. Kyrgyzstan also has introduced GoAL WaSH programme from 2013∼2015. Through this programme, public education is very effective for the clean water and sanitation. On 2015, the government of Tajikistan adopted the Water Sector Reform Programme 2016∼2025. The Water Sector Reform is about transferring water resources management from administrative to hydrological boundaries. As the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources is the reform coordinator, new organizations have been formed: the National Water Council(a consultative body on a state water policy at the national level), River Basin Organizations(a basin executive authority and responsible for coordinating the implementation of the state water policy at a basin level), River Basin Councils(a basin representative authority representing the voice of basin water users and stakeholders). Turkmenistan is the highest per capita users of water in the world. However a salinity increased 25 times compared with former Soviet Union, as inefficient technology and bad water distribution. In order to solve this problem, government, public company, and private stake holders are involving a law amendment in order to implement IWRM. In order to have secure water resources, Swiss have subsidized 2.66million dollars to the Uzbekistan. Introducing drip irrigation and furrow irrigation, 5 farm can save 47,500㎥ of water.Interstate cooperation in Chu and Talas river basins shared by Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan is a most successful example of bilateral relations in the water resources sector. Chu-Talas Water Commission had agreed to a reasonable distribution for the wasted water and will have more investment for the drinking water system. Most of conflict are Uzbekistan and other neighboring countries in the Central Asia, because Uzbekistan is the largest consumer of water resources in this area. The problem of water pollution is an example of regal and territorial issues between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. As there is a long conflict between Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, they could not find an optimal solution of water resources price, because during summer Uzbekistan needs water from Kyrgyzstan’s Toktogul reservoir, in turn, Kyrgyzstan consumes gas from Uzbekistan in winter. As Tajikistan has reactivated a project of construction of a HPP in Rogan, Uzbekistan’s reaction became a real threat to the regional security. According to the Agreement between Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan on water management, the scope of this Agreement is to regulate some issues regarding joint waterworks regulating water drain into the Aral Sea.Multilateral cooperation such as CAREC project, so called, “Stake holders partnerships in collaborative policy making” is started from april 2012. The project is try to connect small river streams like Aspara, Isfara, Ugam and Sudoche lake to have large transboundary basins.To solve water resource problems is not having a competition but having a effective regulation and cooperation among and between Central Asian countries. The good standard of cooperation and transparent norms in the multilateral cooperation will be most efficient and effective solution for the water resources in the Central Asia.",,,,"중앙아시아 국가들의 경우 구소련 체제 하에서는 통합 정책에 의거하여 수자원과 에너지를 서로 공유할 수 있었다. 소련이 붕괴된 후에도 이들 국가들은 일정기간 동안 수자원을 공유하였다. 그러나 기후 변화로 말미암아 수자원이 부족하기 시작하자 중앙아시아 국가들은 수자원을 둘러싸고 갈등이 유발되었다. 키르기즈스탄이나 타지키스탄과 같은 상류 지역 국가들은 수자원이 풍부한 반면 에너지가 부족하고, 하류 지역 국가(우즈베키스탄, 카자흐스탄, 투르크메니스탄)들은 풍부한 에너지 자원을 소유하고 있지만, 수자원이 부족한 실정이다. 상류 지역 국가들은 에너지가 부족하게 되자 물을 새로운 전략 상품으로 부각시키고 있다.중앙아시아의 톈샨산맥 빙하는 지난 50년 동안 면적의 1/4이 줄었고, 2050년이면 나머지 빙하의 절반이 없어질 것이다. 특히 톈샨산맥 빙하는 카자흐스탄, 우즈베키스탄, 키르기즈스탄과 마찬가지로 하류 지방에 있는 국가들에게 가장 중요한 수자원의 원천이 되는 것이다. 세계에서 네 번째로 깨끗한 물이었던 아랄해는 호수 면적의 10%만 남았다. 소금호수인 아랄해 고갈은 유역의 건조화를 가속화시켰고 소금기 섞인 모래바람은 호흡기 질환과 주변국 농토에 영향을 미쳤다. 50만㏊의 산림도 7만㏊로 감축됐었으며, 423종의 식물 중 18종이 멸종했으며 50여종이 멸종 위기에 처해 있고, 동물 개체수도 감소하는 등 생태계 변화가 나타났다.중앙아시아 국가들은 수자원의 공급이나 수질을 개선하거나 통합수자원관리를 위해 여러 프로젝트를 수행하고 있다. 이슬람개발은행은 카자흐스탄의 수자원 개량 사업 프로젝트를 지원하였다. 이 프로젝트는 농촌 지역사회(특히 알마티 지역)에 식수 공급을 개선하고, 관개 시스템을 복구시키기 위한 두 가지 프로젝트로 구성되어 있다. 첫 번째 프로젝트는 알마티 지역의 식수 공급을 개선하기 위해서 15개 지역에 680 ㎞의 수자원 파이프라인을 건설하고자 한다. 두 번째는 ‘카자흐스탄 공화국의 관개 및 배수 시스템 재건’으로 이름 붙여졌고, 알마티 지역의 관개시스템 복원와 남 카자흐스탄 지역의 토양 개선 프로젝트로서 2억 3,550만$에 달하며, IDB와 UNDP가 공동으로 투자하고 있다. 키르기즈스탄의 GoAL WaSH project는 2013∼2015년 동안 공공교육을 통해 깨끗한 식수와 위생을 가능하게 했다. 타지키스탄은 2015년 수자원분야 개혁 프로그램을 채택하여 2016년부터 2025년까지의 수자원 개혁 프로그램을 승인하였다. 이 프로그램은 UNECE, UN, UNDP 그리고 CAREC이 지원했으며, 수로에 대한 수자원 관리의 기반을 변경하는 것과 다른 국가의 시설들의 자격과 역량을 명확히 설정하는 것을 목표로 하고 있다. 특히 이 프로그램과 더불어 정부 조직도 조정하였는데, 에너지･수자원부가 개혁의 조정자였으며, 국가 수자원 위원회, 하천유역기구, 하천유역위원회를 설치하였다. 국가 수자원 위원회는 국가 차원의 수자원 정책 자문기구이고, 하천유역기구는 하천 유역 차원에서 국가 수자원 정책의 이행을 조정하는 역할을 담당하고 있다. 하천유역위원회는 하천지역 물 사용자나 이해관계자의 불만을 대변하는 하천 유역 대표 권한을 보유 하고 있는 조직이다. 투르크메니스탄은 인구 당 물 소비량이 세계 1위이지만 비효율적인 기술과 자원 분배로 말미암아 독립 후 25배의 토지가 염분화 되어 관개농지 염분화 비율이 73%에 이를 정도이다. 투르크메니스탄 정부는 농업 및 수자원부, 환경 및 토지 보호 국가 위원회 등에서 법적 개정을 통해 통합 수자원관리를 도입하려고 한다. 심각한 수자원 확보를 위하여 스위스는 우즈베키스탄에 보조금 266만 달러를 지원하였다. 시범적으로 점적 관개를 도입하고, 고랑 관개를 개선하여 5개의 농장에서 약 47,500㎥의 물을 절약할 수 있게 되었다.카자흐스탄과 키르기즈스탄이 공유하고 있는 츄-탈라스강 유역 협력은 가장 성공적인 협력의 예이다. 츄-탈라스 수자원위원회는 폐수 배분 비율에 합의하였고, 양 국가 간 상수도 시설에 대해 자기 자본 조달을 하도록 하였다. 우즈베키스탄의 물 소비량이 가장 많기 때문에 중앙아시아 국가 사이의 대부분의 수자원 분쟁은 우즈베키스탄을 중심으로 발생한다. 카자흐스탄과 우즈베키스탄의 수자원 문제는 수질오염이 가장 중요한 역할을 담당한다. 키르기즈스탄과 우즈베키스탄은 톡토굴 저수지의 물 공급과 가스공급에 대한 가격 설정 메카니즘이 문제로 부각되고 있다. 타지키스탄과의 문제는 로건댐 건설에 관한 것으로 집약된다. 투르크메니스탄과 우즈베키스탄은 수자원 관리에 대한 우즈베키스탄과 투르크메니스탄 사이의 협약에 의거하여 아랄해에 배수하는 수자원을 규제하는 것으로 되어 있어서 양 국은 그나마 좋은 관계를 유지하고 있다.다자간 협력인 CAREC 프로젝트 “Stake holders partnerships in collaborative policy making”는 2012년 4월에 시작하여 소규모 하천인 아스파라, 이스파라, 우감강과 슈도체를 연계하여 대규모 강 유역으로 확대하는 통합수자원관리시스템(IWRM)을 도입하는 것이다.수자원 문제는 효율적인 규제 메카니즘을 만들거나 협약을 통해서 해결하는 것이 바람직하다. 다자간 협력은 기준을 설정하거나 적절하고 투명한 규범을 구축하면 수자원 가치를 평가하는데 결정적인 역할을 담당할 수 있을 것이다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1738-3382,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-01-01,KJD:ART002268304,,

The wastes generated in the largest volumes during drilling oil and gas wells are drilling fluids and cuttings. There are several options to manage drilling wastes: discharge, downhole injection and onshore disposal.

It identifies and proposes to develop the two following thematic strands, both adopting an approach from MATERIALS to SYSTEMS:(1) RESHAPING THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT, whereby the focus lies on the rehabilitation, maintenance and management of the existing built environment;(2) CONSTRUCTION AS AN ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL PROCESS, whereby the focus lies on innovation and industrialization as means to improve the environmental performance and the quality, safety and economy of the construction products.These two thematic strands are highly complementary and are combined together to maximise the push towards a more sustainable construction. They are in full agreement with the Horizon 2020 pillars/priorities, addressing the SOCIETAL CHALLENGES that fall within the expertise of ISISE and they tackle relevant topics aimed at improving INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP. The strategic programme of ISISE is strongly based on the achievements of ISISE during the previous evaluation period (2008-2013). The third pillar/priority of HORIZON 2020, EXCELLENCE is the key driver of ISISE for the definition of its strategic programme 2015-2020. The strategy of ISISE in this aspect consists of a continuous process of improvement of the quality of its human resources (in particular its integrated members). Consequently, the minimum requirements of ISISE to become and remain an integrated member for this new period were significantly increased.The strategic programme of ISISE 2015-2020 follows a matrix organization that combines the two aforementioned thematic strands with the existing group organization of ISISE, according to the various structural materials. These correspond to Historical and Masonry Structures (HMS), covering masonry, timber and geotechnics, Structural Concrete (SC), covering concrete and cement based-composites, and Steel and Mixed Construction Technologies (SMCT), covering steel and its combination with other materials.The strategic programme further identifies more specific areas of research, integrated in research clusters that are largely transversal to the research groups and the thematic strands. They represent more specific areas of research that were developed and consolidated in the period 2008-12, and new areas of research that correspond to additional directions for the further development of ISISE.The consolidated research clusters are: FIRE SAFETY (supported by a large investment in experimental facilities / FIRELAB), EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING, MASONRY CONSTRUCTION, TIMBER CONSTRUCTION, STEEL CONSTRUCTION, incorporating 2 sub-clusters: CONNECTIONS and NONLINEAR DESIGN AND STABILITY, CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION, and COMPOSITE AND MIXED CONSTRUCTION.The new areas of research of ISISE deal with: - BLAST& IMPACT (only group in Portugal addressing civil engineering and blast and impact); - SUSTAINABILITY, ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND ARCHITECTURE (significantly enlarged scope based on strong interaction with complementary areas such as architecture, mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering); - ENERGY, OIL & GAS (consolidation of innovative work on high performance solutions for wind towers but an ambitious objective of entering the field of offshore oil and gas industry, with a particular emphasis on sub-sea applications, profiting from the fact that a large proportion of the required structures are made of steel, the heavy investments that the leading consultancy companies in this field are making in Portugal, and the high number of graduate civil engineers specialized in steel structures that are being hired to work in this field); - GEOTECHNICS (a classical field but new within ISISE, providing a big potential for cross-fertilization of new ideas and complementarity); - BIOENGINEERING (supported by a large investment in a new Institute for Bio-Sustainability / IB-S that is a joint-venture with another research centre to implement a dedicated infrastructure to integrate engineering and biological sciences around the built and natural environments, developing bio-based strategies for the built heritage).The strategic programme addresses the various activities that are crucial to ensure a successful implementation: besides the essential research strategy and planning, advanced educational programs directed towards international recognition and attraction of highly capable international PhD students and post-doc candidates are an essential component of the ISISE plan, coupled with intensive dissemination efforts (strongly based on high quality scientific and technological outputs) and a continuous improvement of the human and physical resources of ISISE (with strong emphasis on experimental capabilities).Finally, the strategic programme also acknowledges the importance of strong leadership that is able to motivate all the members of ISISE and details the management organization of ISISE.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,UID/ECI/04029/2013,,,,,,,,Instituto para a Sustentabilidade e Inovação em Engenharia Estrutural,Instituto para a Sustentabilidade e Inovação em Engenharia Estrutural,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15470152,,

The damage was found during the frontal and local archaeological survey carried out in the frame of Tashyne village council expert examination regarding the presence or absence of archaeological sites in the area of the wind farm and related facilities installation. The history of archaeological works in Berezanka area is analyzed from the first archaeological surveys at the end of the 19th century, works during the 20th century with their stages to the description of the latest studies at the beginning of the 21st century.The studied area is very rich in archaeological sites in a wide chronological range. Basically, these are burial complexes (barrows) from the Late Neolithic to the Early Iron Age and the settlements of the Bronze Age. There are many archaeological objects of ancient times (settlements and burial grounds) belonging to the Olbia rural district (choras) dated from the 5th century BCE to the beginning of the CE.A brief description of the studied burials and their preliminary identification is given. Three burials, one of which is a double one, are described in detail.Two burials belong to Babyne historical and cultural circle dated to the end of the 1st quarter - beginning of the 2nd quarter of the 2nd millennium BCE. The double burial is in a small catacomb with a niche, and a separate one is in a stone box (made of large and medium limestone slabs). The inventory and the location of the skeletons in the graves are given.One burial, taking into account the typology of the skeleton position and the location of the entrance grave relative to the probable center of the mound and the main burial of an earlier historical epoch, is more likely may be dated to the beginning of CE (Sarmatian time, Middle Sarmatian archaeological culture).Taking into account the achieved results the further work at the site will enable: to complete the study of the burial complex; to conduct a comprehensive analysis of anthropological, zoological and material evidence; to set the bounds of the site; to identify the main burial; to separate the primary mound from the later layers (additions) of the mound; to introduce new data on the presence of the nomads of the Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age in the North Black Sea region; to separate or fill the contact areas of different local population groups of one cultural and historical community; to study the migration and trade and economic relations of the region in the specified historical period.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1998-4634,2708-0226,,,,,,,,,,"Mykola Natl Univ, Mykolaiv, UkraineNatl Acad Sci Ukraine, Olbia Natl Hist & Archaeol Reserve, Village Parutyno, Mykolaiv Region, Ukraine",Mykola Natl Univ,,,2020-01-01,WOS:000904718100024,,

Quantitative diamondoid analysis (QDA) is discussed as a method to reveal such mixtures and examples from the San Joaquin Basin, California, USA, and the offshore Santos Basin. Brazil, are used to illustrate this application. While QDA reveals mixed-source oils, other techniques are necessary to correlate the mature component of the oil to its source, an identification which is necessary for correct input of effective sources into basin models. One of these methods is quantitative extended diamondoid analysis (QEDA). It consists of comparing relative concentrations of large diamondoid isomers and homologs in oils and condensates. Correlations using QEDA are much like biomarkers correlations. However, due to the stability of diamondoids, QEDA can be done on fluids of very high thermal maturity. Compound specific isotope analysis of diamondoids (CSIA-D), the determination of the carbon isotopic signature of a variety of individual diamondoid species, is another novel and complementary method to tie high-maturity fluids back to their source. QEDA and CSIA-D are, in fact, universally applicable to all source-correlation problems. Example correlations using QEDA and CSIA-D from Eastern Venezuela, West Africa (Ghana), Brazil margin, West Siberia and the Williston Basin are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In a hydrodynamic aquifer pore-waters flow in the direction of overpressure reduction, whereas trapped hydrocarbons remain static. The main effect of this pressure disequilibrium in the aquifer is a tilt of the free water levels (FWL) in the direction of lower overpressure.Although the impact of hydrodynamics on the petroleum system is established in the oil industry and provides important information for exploration and field development, the interaction of CO2 storage and hydrodynamic flow has hardly been investigated. Supercritical CO2 has a density comparable with oil densities in known hydrodynamic systems in the North Sea. Hence, a tilted CO2-water FWL is expected and has to be taken into account during the planning of CO2 storage. Hydrodynamic spill points will replace structural spill points as a parameter in CO2 storage capacity calculations.Storage security is dependent on CO2 dissolution rates, among other factors. The more effectively CO2 dissolves into brine the more CO2 will be permanently stored in the subsurface. Numerical simulations show that CO2 storage in hydrodynamic aquifers enhances the dissolution of CO2 compared with a static regime. When CO2 dissolves into brine, the brine density increases and the CO2-saturated brine sinks to the bottom of the reservoir and is replaced by under-saturated brine. In a hydrodynamic system the brine saturated with CO2 will be removed more effectively from the CO2-brine interface. Hence, CO2 comes in contact with more under-saturated brine and dissolves at a greater rate.The presence of hydrodynamic flow in a reservoir requires a high degree of understanding but research on oil reservoirs has proven that it is an uncertainty that can be adequately characterized. For long term CO2 storage operations hydrodynamic flow can even be an opportunity for more secure CO2 storage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study evaluates the use of peat-derived biochar (PB) as a bio-sorbent for the sorption and removal of crude oil spills from synthetic seawater. Experiments were designed to determine the effect of four operating factors (PB/crude oil contact time, PB dosage, oil dosage, and temperature) on two performance indicators (crude oil sorption capacity of PB, S, and oil removal efficiency, R%). Regression models containing linear, quadratic, and two-way interaction terms were developed to predict S and R% from the four factors. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to identify the optimum conditions for the sorption and removal of crude oil from seawater. The performance indicators were predicted with a high degree of accuracy, i.e. with coefficient of determination (R-2) values exceeding 90%. The optimum values of S and R% were estimated to be 32.5 g of crude oil/g of sorbent and 91.2% respectively. These optimum values were attained after 70 min of PB/crude oil contact time and at a temperature of 45 degrees C.

For the inversion estimates, we use the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model (FLEXPART) to establish the source-receptor relationship between sampled atmospheric concentrations and surface fluxes. Our prior CH4 emission estimates are from the California Greenhouse Gas Emissions Measurements (CALGEM) inventory. We use three meteorological configurations to drive FLEXPART and subsequently construct three inversions to analyze the final optimized estimates and their uncertainty (one standard deviation). We conduct May and June inversions independently and derive similar total CH4 emission estimates for the SJV: 13528Mg/h in May and 13519Mg/h in June. The inversion result is 1.7 times higher than the prior estimate from CALGEM. We also use an independent mass balance approach to estimate CH4 emissions in the northern SJV for one flight when meteorological conditions allowed. The mass balance estimate provides a confirmation of our inversion results, and these two independent estimates of the total CH4 emissions in the SJV are consistent with previous studies. In this study, we provide optimized CH4 emissions estimates at 0.1 degrees horizontal resolution. Using independent spatial information on major CH4 sources, we estimate that livestock contribute 75-77% and oil/gas production contributes 15-18% of the total CH4 emissions in the SJV.

The study area was divided into four ecoregions differing widely in climatic conditions and management regime. The forest age distributions (as derived from inventory data) differed by ecozone with fewer old stands in the Coast Range and the East Cascades, and a relatively uniform distribution of ages from 0 to 815 in the Cascade Mountains. Age distributions also differed by land ownership, with fewer old stands on non-federal lands than on national forest lands. Estimated biomass increased rapidly in early stand development and tended to stabilize after about 200 years. Peak biomass in the semi-arid East Cascades was about one-third that of the other ecoregions (median biomass at asymptote similar to 9 and similar to 25 kg C m(-2), respectively). The timing and magnitude of maximum net primary production also varied by ecoregion, with the high productivity Coast Range forests reaching a maximum NPP before 30 years of age (median similar to 1 kg C m(-2) y(-1)), and the low productivity East Cascades reaching a maximum NPP between 80 and 100 years (median similar to 0.3 kg C m(-2) y(-1)). Productivity was generally lower in older stands with the exception of the East Cascades ecoregion where, contrary to the paradigm of age-related decline in forest growth, the oldest stands had the highest NPR The East Cascades also differed from the other ecoregions in that the proportion of NPP allocated below-round decreased rather than increased with stand age. This study demonstrates the value of combining data from intensive and extensive measurement sites for improved estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes as well as improved parameterization of process models used in scaling carbon flux over broad regions.

These impacts will depend on two factors: (1) the variability of the total renewable power generation on different time scales and (2) the possibilities of accurately forecasting these fluctuations. In this paper, previous research on variability assessment and forecasting of solar, wind, wave and tidal energy resources is reviewed. The aim is to summarize the state of knowledge in each area and to compare the approaches used for the respective resources. For temporal variability, methods and models used for assessing the variability are surveyed, as well as what is known about the variability at individual sites and for larger aggregates of sites. For forecasting, an overview of forecasting methods for the different resources is made, and selected forecasting methods are compared over different time horizons. An important finding is that it is hard to draw strong conclusions from the existing studies due to differences in approaches and presentation of results. There is a need for further, more coherent studies that analyze the variability for the different resources in comparable ways, using data with the same resolution, and for studies that evaluate the smoothing effect and complementarity of combinations of several renewable energy resources. For forecasting, future research should suggest ways to evaluate forecasts from different renewable energy sources in easily comparable ways, using data from the same locations or regions, with the same temporal and spatial resolution, and with comparable metrics for the forecasting errors.

Five nitrogen fertilization rates were tested (in g ure m(-2)): 4 (N1), 8 (N2), 12 (N3), 16 (N4), and 0 (control, CK). The biomass of different organs of Jerusalem artichoke during the growth cycle was significantly higher in N2 than the other treatments. Under different nitrogen treatments, carbon density in organs of Jerusalem artichoke ranged from 336 to 419 g C kg(-1). Carbon sequestration in Jerusalem artichoke was higher in treatments with nitrogen fertilization compared to the CK treatment. The highest carbon sequestration was found in the N2 treatment. Soil carbon content was higher in the 0-10 cm than 10-20 cm layer, with nitrogen fertilization increasing carbon content in both soil layers.

Firstly, the designed solution exploits high-resolution visual and range data acquired with state-of-the-art technologies (swath mapping systems, underwater vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles) and processed through novel approaches to create a synthetic topographic relief basemap and to analyze its geomorphology, as well as the anthropogenic interventions. Secondly, this framework allows to write narrative scenarios and produce interactive VR experiences, through a set of custom tools for multimedia content management.

This paper describes experiments carried out on a chronic release of crude oil and aims to understand the residence time of oil slicks using a combination of remote sensing platforms and GPS tracked drifters. From April 2017 to August 2018, we performed multiple synchronized deployments of drogued and un-drogued drifters to monitor the life time (residence time) of the surface oil slicks originated from the MC20 spill site, located close to the Mississippi Delta. The hydrodynamic design of the two types of drifters allowed us to compare their performance differences. We found the un-drogued drifter to be more appropriate to measure the speed of oil transport. Drifter deployments under various wind conditions show that stronger winds lead to reduce the length of the slick, presumably because of an increase in the evaporation rate and entrainment of oil in the water produced by wave action.

This study documents the first attempt to map soil pH (1:5 H2O) at high resolution (100 m) in New Zealand. The regression framework used follows the paradigm of digital soil mapping, and a limited number of environmental covariates were selected using variable selection, before calibration of a quantile regression forest model. In order to adapt the outcomes of this work to a wide range of different depth supports, a new approach, which includes depth of sampling as a covariate, is proposed. It relies on data augmentation, a process where virtual observations are drawn from statistical populations constructed using the observed data, based on the top and bottom depth of sampling, and including the uncertainty surrounding the soil pH measurement. A single model can then be calibrated and deployed to estimate pH a various depths. Results showed that the data augmentation routine had a beneficial effect on prediction uncertainties, in particular when reference measurement uncertainties are taken into account. Further testing found that the optimal rate of augmentation for this dataset was 3-fold. Inspection of the final model revealed that the most important variables for predicting soil pH distribution in New Zealand were related to land cover and climate, in particular to soil water balance. The evaluation of this approach on those validation sites set aside before modelling showed very good results (R-2=0.65,CCC=0.79,RMSE=0.54), that significantly out-performed existing soil pH information for the country.",,,,,,,,,24,1,0,0,13,0,25,,,,2072-4292,,,,,,,,,,"Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Manawatu Mail Ctr, Private Bag 11052, Palmerston North 4442, New ZealandTe Punaha Matatini, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New ZealandManaaki Whenua Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New ZealandManaaki Whenua Landcare Res, POB 10, Wellington 6143, New Zealand",Te Punaha Matatini,,,2020-11-03,WOS:000580080400001,,

However, the ecological relevance of seabass capacity to detect and avoid WSF remains to be established. In the short term, such a response is indeed liable to reduce seabass contact time with oil-contaminated water and thus preserve their functional integrity. In the long term, however, avoidance may contribute to the displacement of a population into a possibly less auspicious environment, with consequences very similar to those of contaminant exposure, that is, disturbed population dynamics and demography.

They are sediment and organic matter accumulation zones, which combined with a climate of high rainfall and low evaporation function as water storage systems. Changes to the geomorphic structure of these systems via incision and channelisation can have profound impacts on their hydrological function. The aim of this study was to develop an understanding of how changes to the geomorphic structure of these systems alter their hydrological function, measured as changes and variability in swamp water table levels and discharge. We monitored the water table levels and discharges of three intact and three channelised THPSS in the Blue Mountains between March 2015 and June 2016. We found that water levels in intact swamps were largely stable over the monitoring period. Water levels rose only in high rainfall events, returned quickly to antecedent levels after rain, and drawdown during dry periods was not significant. In contrast, the water table levels in channelised THPSS were highly variable. Water levels rose quickly after almost all rainfall events and declined significantly during dry periods. Discharge also showed marked differences with the channelised THPSS discharging 13 times more water than intact swamps, even during dry periods. Channelised THPSS also had flashier storm hydrographs than intact swamps. These results have profound implications for the capacity of these swamps to act as water storage reservoirs in the headwaters of catchments and for their ability to maintain base flow to downstream catchments during dry times. Changes to geomorphic structure and hydrological function also have important implications for a range of other swamp functions such as carbon storage, emission and exports, contaminant sorption, downstream water quality and biodiversity, as well as the overall fate of these swamps under a changing climate.

Thus, in modeling the diffusion process, a discrete method has been employed for the generation of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) to illustrate superdiffusive transport. The algorithm is implemented to predict oil slick trajectories following the Arteaga oil spill accident that occurred near the Dalian coastal region in 2005.

One major concern of the static failure of flexible pipes is the occurrence of damage on external sheath and high resistance bandages that in some cases can generate radial instability of those structures. The new ultra-deep water fields will require a better understanding of those failure mechanisms and relationship between compressive loads and defect sizes to guarantee a safe operation, otherwise the expected service lifetime will not be achieved. Besides that, historical data of in-service failures of this type of equipment shows that several flexible pipes have to be early replaced due to missing of proper data to evaluate damaged structures. Therefore, even worse results are expected on ultra-deep water field application.Flexible risers comprise multiple structural layers, which combine leads to characteristics of resistance, tightness and desired flexibility, both for its installation and operation. Regarding the mechanical strength, flexible riser structure must withstand several load modes acting together or isolated. Within this context, axial compression acting individually or combined is the responsible for radial instability of flexible pipes.Radial instability occurs mainly when the flexible pipe suffers damage on the outer layers, which are responsible for radial strain resistance. This damage on the external sheath and bandages occurs due to the launching procedure, project or material failures, wearing, excessive loading, abandonment procedures or possible falling. Damages on the external bandage layer, together with axial compressive load may lead to catastrophic failures due to radial strains, as well known as birdcaging or lateral bucking, thereby leading to a complex local analysis in the search for solutions capable to predict riser behavior.Therefore, this study intends to build a relationship between the size of the defects and compressive loads for flexible risers that leads to birdcage formation, which consequently reduces the pipe expected life. The measurements were performed in full scale mechanical tests of two sizes of flexible risers. After that, finite element method models calibrated and validated with mechanical tests data, were used to extrapolate the results for other possible defect scenarios. The case studies for an analysis of the relationship between compressive loads and sizes of defects which lead to radial instability and consequently to pipe stiffness decreasing, were two flexible pipes of different sizes, widely used on offshore applications, with produced defects. Besides that, thirty-two conditions were analyzed through the model developed with variations in the size of defects, according to riser geometric limits in length and width.The results indicated that the radial instability in flexible pipes with defect on high resistance bandages does not reach the failure criterion for axial stiffness if compressive loads are limited to a threshold. Also, the defect size on bandage of flexible pipes subjected to compressive loads influences the radial instability, reducing the stiffness up to five times according to obtained results, especially depending on its length and without significant dependence of the width. One of the simulated conditions presented a change on the deformation distribution located near the manufactured defect, indicating another type of instability known as lateral buckling.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,,,978-0-7918-5769-4,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, LAMEF, STRESSTEC, Porto Alegre, RS, BrazilUniv Fed Rio Grande do Sul, LAMEF, UNIRITTER, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",,,,2017-12-27,WOS:000417224900025,,

This model embeds a terrestrial biogeochemical component with explicit carbon-nitrogen interaction to account for soil nutrient control on plant growth and the land carbon sink. The model's ocean biogeochemical component is largely updated to simulate the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and oxygen such that oceanic primary productivity can be controlled by multiple nutrient limitations. The ocean nitrogen cycle is coupled with the land component via river discharge processes, and external inputs of iron from pyrogenic and lithogenic sources are considered. Comparison of a historical simulation with observation studies showed that the model could reproduce the transient global climate change and carbon cycle as well as the observed large-scale spatial patterns of the land carbon cycle and upper-ocean biogeochemistry. The model demonstrated historical human perturbation of the nitrogen cycle through land use and agriculture and simulated the resultant impact on the terrestrial carbon cycle. Sensitivity analyses under preindustrial conditions revealed that the simulated ocean biogeochemistry could be altered regionally (and substantially) by nutrient input from the atmosphere and rivers. Based on an idealized experiment in which CO2 was prescribed to increase at a rate of 1% yr(-1), the transient climate response (TCR) is estimated to be 1.5 K, i.e., approximately 70% of that from our previous ESM used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The cumulative airborne fraction (AF) is also reduced by 15% because of the intensified land carbon sink, which results in an airborne fraction close to the multimodel mean of the CMIP5 ESMs. The transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE) is 1.3KEgC(-1), i.e., slightly smaller than the average of the CMIP5 ESMs, which suggests that optimistic future climate projections will be made by the model. This model and the simulation results contribute to CMIP6. The MIROC-ES2L could further improve our understanding of climate-biogeochemical interaction mechanisms, projections of future environmental changes, and exploration of our future options regarding sustainable development by evolving the processes of climate, biogeochemistry, and human activities in a holistic and interactive manner.",,,,,,,,,215,5,0,0,54,0,222,,,1991-959X,1991-9603,,,,,,,,,,"Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showamachi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, JapanUniv Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo 1538505, JapanNatl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, JapanAzabu Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 2525201, Japan",,,,2020-05-13,WOS:000535190100001,,

In industrial landfills, the most serious ecological problem is the contamination of soil and local groundwater by landfill leachate. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) represent a hazardous group of harmful chemical compounds that threaten human and ecosystem health. This study focuses on a PAH-contaminated soil from a landfill site in New South Wales, Australia. Soil was exposed to two different bioremediation treatments, natural attenuation and biostimulation using pea straw. The bacterial community composition and diversity of the PAH-contaminated soil were also examined using high throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The results revealed that PAHs were degraded naturally by indigenous microorganisms; however, the addition of plant residues led to enhanced degradation (66.6%) at the beginning of the treatment, although in all treatments a degradation plateau occurred between 43 and 102 days of incubation during bioremediation. Quantitative PCR analysis showed an increase in the number of 16S rRNA and ITS gene copies as well as genes associated with Gram-positive PAH-degrading bacteria in the soil amended with pea straw. Next generation sequencing results and diversity indices revealed that a high proportion of the sequences from all soil samples belonged to the Proteobacteria phyla; gammaprotobacteria was the dominant class in all the investigated samples. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria were the most dominant in the natural attenuation and pea straw treated soil bacterial communities. The largest shift in bacterial communities was in the pea straw amended soils with increased abundances by Day 42 of Pseudomonas, Pseudoxanthomonas, Lewinella and Parvibaculum; these organisms are all known for their abilities to degrade petroleum hydrocarbons. However by Day 102, these organisms were decreased or not detected in both NA and PS treated soil samples at the end of incubation which may explain the degradation plateau. These findings suggest that Gram-negative PAH-degrading bacteria, mainly Pseudomonas sp., may be the key contributor to PAH-degradation in the landfill-polluted soil.",,,,,,,,,40,8,0,0,35,1,52,,,0016-7061,1872-6259,,,,,,,,,,"RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Ctr Environm Sustainabil & Remediat, Bundoora, Vic 3083, AustraliaAlgabal Algarbi Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Gharian, Libya",Algabal Algarbi Univ,,,2019-02-15,WOS:000457657000023,,

Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are rising at an unprecedented rate and the ocean is becoming more acidic due to carbon uptake. Projected climate change is due to alter the ability of terrestrial ecosystems to store carbon. Due to the complex interactions between atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, climate, terrestrial ecosystems and ocean circulation, predictions about how today's fossil fuel emissions will alter the future world are very uncertain. Yet the consequences of today's fossil fuel emissions could be great for humankind in the coming decades and centuries. The present day is not the only known time period in which atmospheric carbon dioxide and climate have changed. Carbon dioxide concentrations have been measured within air bubbles that became trapped in polar ice cores dating back up to 800 000 years. These air bubbles reveal that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have fluctuated many times as the Earth's climate has changed between ice ages and warm periods. Carbon dioxide levels are found to have been about 40% higher during warm periods than during ice ages. These carbon dioxide increases are thought to both contribute to the warmer climates (through the greenhouse effect) and have been caused by the warmer climates. When atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were low, the ocean stored more carbon, and when atmospheric levels were high the ocean stored less carbon. However, the precise mechanisms by which changes in climate alter atmospheric carbon dioxide levels remain unknown. Identifying these mechanisms will not only help us to understand the past, but will also help to us understand the likely future consequences of today's fossil fuel emissions. This proposal aims to constrain the possible causes of the past glacial-interglacial changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Two specific research questions will be posed. Firstly, precisely what new data needs to be gathered to accurately constrain the causes of carbon dioxide changes? The existing carbon-cycle data cannot distinguish between competing explanations of carbon dioxide change: many alternative explanations all appear to agree with the data. In order to know what explanation truly explains the glacial-interglacial CO2 change, we need to identify data that will agree with only one of the possible explanations. This research proposal will implement a novel matrix based method to determine what new data is required to test the alternative explanations. Secondly, this proposal will answer 'why do different types of computer models of the ocean appear to store carbon in different ways?' Recent theoretical advances will be utilised, which allow carbon storage in computer models to be analysed in a new quantitative way. Until we understand the differences between ocean models, we cannot understand how the real ocean stores carbon, and how this carbon storage changed over glacial-interglacial cycles. The coupled changes in climate and the carbon cycle at the transition from the last ice-age to the modern warm period are an important analogue for the present system. Just how sensitive should we expect climate to be to our human carbon emissions? And, in return, how sensitive to the fossil fuel induced climate change will the future carbon cycle be? A better understanding of natural carbon cycle behaviour, during the transition between past ice-ages and warm periods, will help to improve predictions about the future of climate and the carbon cycle. This will, in turn, help to inform us of the likely outcomes of the choices we make regarding fossil fuel emissions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/I020725/2,,,,,,,,University of Southampton,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15297304,,

To mitigate such disasters, timely intervention to contain and recover oil before it spreads is critical. Standard lipophilic sorbents do not work because crude oil is too viscous to flow into them, especially in cold weather. This has led to the proposal of using graphene foam, also an excellent lipophilic sorbent, since it is a conductor and can be electrically heated, thus rendering the crude fluid enough to absorb. Yet wiring, powering and electrically heating any mass over a large area in high seas is clearly a challenge. Here we present a solution using a solar-activated graphene tile: within seconds upon exposure to daylight, it heats up and absorbs, eventually filling crude oil into 74 % of its own volume. It may be further coated by a lipophilic oil-permeating thermal insulation to become a light-absorbing, heat-retaining and oil- absorbing black hole. Capable of withstanding high heat up to 600 degrees C, tiles can be rejuvenated by ridding themselves of adsorbed oil in self-combustion, allowing even a small supply of tiles to last and contain oil spill for some time. The reusable tile is made by pyrolyzing a poly(vinylidene chloride) foam of an identical size and shape, obtaining a density of 16 kg m(-3) and a strength of 11.7 kPa. Upon emergency, tiles initially installed as ultralight load-supporting constructs on oil-production platforms and crude- transport vessels become immediately available for repeated oil absorbing at 41 times their own weight. Therefore, they can provide the crucial first-response kit for mitigating oil-spill disasters. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In the ocean development, the utilization of neutral buoyancy style underwater robot which is utilized for investigation of resources, installation of offshore structure and repair. Though the action range is wide, because it floats, robot it moves by the reaction, when the manipulator is operated in the work. Therefore, accurate positioning is not completed only by the actuator of the manipulator. In this study, it is proposed that the reaction of the manipulator is compensated for by the counter arm, the reaction of a object gripped at the manipulator tip is compensated for by the board in which area and direction change and which is installed at the counter arm tip, and the moment is compensated for by a reaction wheel. One of the features of this technique is that it does not disturb the flow of the circumference very much. The positioning system is developed, and the effectiveness is confirmed by the numerical simulation. However, it is weak for the disturbance, though it is effective in the still water since the movement of the counter arm is restricted in the manipulator movement. Therefore, the compensation by reaction wheel and oscillation -wing is proposed. At first, it is confirmed by the model experiment that whether lift coefficient and drag coefficient in steady state could apply to unsteady positioning control. On the basis of the result, the mathematical model of underwater robot is derived. Then the positioning system is developed by the application of the sliding mode control theory, and the validity is confirmed by the numerical simulation. In the result, it is cleared that the accurate positioning which held the translational motion still is possible.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,9650280,,,,,,,,Kanagawa Institute of Technology,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14511844,,

Food grade TiO2, which is FDA approved for use as food additive in the United States, was tested as a photocatalyst for this novel application. Photocatalytic pre-treatment (0.05 wt.% TiO2, UV irradiation 18W m(-2), 350-400 nm) for 24 h in a bench top photoreactor increased the soluble organic carbon content of weathered oil by 60%, and enhanced its subsequent biodegradation (measured as O-2 consumption in a respirometer) by 37%. Photocatalytic pre-treatment was also tested outdoors under sunlight illumination, but no significant increase in solubility or biodegradation was observed after 11 d of exposure. Although sunlight irradiation of food-grade TiO2 generated ROS (assessed by the degradation of 4-chlorophenol as a probe compound), the efficacy of weathered oil pre-treatment was apparently hindered by sinking of the photocatalysts under quiescent conditions and illumination occlusion by the oil. Overall, results indicate that photocatalytic pre-treatment to stimulate bioremediation of weathered oil deserves further consideration, but controlling the buoyancy and surface hydrophobicity of the photocatalysts will be important for future efforts to enable ROS generation in proximity to the target compounds.

The assessment included carbon sequestration after land application of the garden waste and composts, and associated emissions. The removed woody fraction was incinerated and energy recovery included as heat and electricity. The functional unit of the assessment was treatment of 1000 kg of garden waste generated in Denmark. Overall, the results showed that composting of garden waste resulted in comparable or higher environmental impact potentials (depletion of abiotic resources, marine eutrophication, and terrestrial eutrophication and acidification) than no treatment before land application. The toxicity potentials showed the highest normalised impact potentials for all the scenarios, but were unaffected by the different garden waste treatments. The choice of energy source for substituted heat and electricity production affected the performance of the different treatment scenarios with respect to climate change. The scenarios with removal of the woody fraction performed better than the scenarios without removal of the woody fraction when fossil energy sources were substituted, but performed worse when renewable energy sources were substituted. Furthermore, the study showed the importance of including long-term emission factors after land application of fresh and composted garden waste products since the greatest proportion of carbon and nitrogen emissions occurred after land application in three out of the five scenarios for carbon and in all scenarios for nitrogen.

In this study, we explored the effect of CO2 and impurities (NO2, SO2, H2S) on reservoir permeability by measuring changes in grain size distributions after a prolonged period of 9 months, simulating in situ experimental conditions. It was found that the effects of pure CO2 and CO2-H2S are relatively small, i.e., CO2 increased permeability by 5.5% and CO2-H2S decreased it by 5.5%. Also, CO2-SO2 slightly decreased permeability by 6.25%, while CO2-NO2 showed the most pronounced effect, reducing permeability by 41.6%. The decrease in permeability showed a correlation with decreasing pH of the formation water and this equally correlates with a decrease in geometric mean of the grain diameter.

Fourteen dispersants are listed on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP). Availability of environmental effects information for such agents is limited, and individual components of dispersants are largely proprietary. Probabilistic hazard assessment approaches including Chemical Toxicity Distributions (CTDs) may be useful as an initial step toward prioritizing environmental hazards from the use of dispersants. In the present study, we applied the CTD approach to two acute toxicity datasets: NCP (the contingency plan dataset) and DHOS (a subset of NCP listed dispersants reevaluated subsequent to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill). These datasets contained median lethal concentration (LC50) values for dispersants alone and dispersant:oil mixtures, in two standard marine test species, Menidia betyllina and Mysidopsis bahia. These CTDs suggest that dispersants alone are generally less toxic than oil. In contrast, most dispersant:oil mixtures are more toxic than oil alone. For the two datasets (treated separately because of differing methodologies), CTDs would predict 95% of dispersant:oil mixtures to have acute toxicity values above 0.32 and 0.76 mg/L for Mysidopsis and 0.33 mg/L and 1.06 mg/L for Menidia (for DHOS and NCP, respectively). These findings demonstrate the utility of CTDs as a means to evaluate the comparative ecotoxicity of dispersants alone and in mixture with different oil types. The approaches presented here also provide valuable tools for prioritizing prospective and retrospective environmental assessments of oil dispersants. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011;30:1704-1708.

One area of potential is the modi. cation of cropping practices to increase soil carbon storage.Here, we report short-medium term changes in soil carbon under zero tillage cropping systems and perennial vegetation, both in a replicated field experiment and on nearby farmers' paddocks, on carbon-depleted Black Vertosols in the upper Liverpool Plains catchment.Soil organic carbon stocks (C-S) remained unchanged under both zero tillage long fallow wheat-sorghum rotations and zero tillage continuous winter cereal in a replicated field experiment from 1994 to 2000. There was some evidence of accumulation of C-S under intensive (>1 crop/year) zero tillage response cropping. There was significant accumulation of C-S (similar to 0.35 Mg/ha.year) under 3 types of perennial pasture, despite removal of aerial biomass with each harvest. Significant accumulation was detected in the 0-0.1, 0.1-0.2, and 0.2-0.4 m depth increments under lucerne and the top 2 increments under mixed pastures of lucerne and phalaris and of C3 and C4 perennial grasses. Average annual rainfall for the period of observations was 772 mm, greater than the 40-year average of 680 mm. A comparison of major attributes of cropping systems and perennial pastures showed no association between aerial biomass production and accumulation rates of C-S but a positive correlation between the residence times of established plants and accumulation rates of C-S. C-S also remained unchanged (1998/2000-07) under zero tillage cropping on nearby farms, irrespective of paddock history before 1998/2000 (zero tillage cropping, traditional cropping, or similar to 10 years of sown perennial pasture).These results are consistent with previous work in Queensland and central western New South Wales suggesting that the climate (warm, semi-arid temperate, semi-arid subtropical) of much of the inland cropping country in eastern Australia is not conducive to accumulation of soil carbon under continuous cropping, although they do suggest that C-S may accumulate under several years of healthy perennial pastures in rotation with zero tillage cropping.",,,,,,,,,56,2,0,0,48,0,58,,,0004-9573,1446-568X,,,,,,,,,,"Tamworth Agr Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Calala, NSW 2340, AustraliaUniv New England, NSW Dept Environm & Climate Change, Armidale, NSW 2351, AustraliaUniv New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000266305100004,,

P is deficient in Sub Saharan Africa threatening primary production. That in part is due to the occlusion of Pin Fe and Al oxides in the weathered soils. This problem is aggravated by the high cost of P fertilizers, lack of both appropriate technologies for its application and government support to facilitate and strengthen its use in small-scale farming. Evaluation of soil P availability in the mixed-species plantations established on natural savannas in the Congolese coastal plains highlights that high C accretion involves low P availability in the mixed-species (50% acacia and 50% euca-lyptus) stands relative to others. P availability in 0-0.05 m in the mixed-species stands (6.94 +/- 0.45 mg kg(-1)) was lower than in acacia (8.07 +/- 0.63 mg kg(-1)) and eucalyptus (8.46 +/- 0.79 mg kg(-1)). C stock in the 0.25 m was higher in the mixed-species (17.8 +/- 0.7 t.ha(-1)) relative to acacia (16.7 t.ha(-1) +/- 0.4) and eucalyptus (15.9 t.ha(-1) +/- 0.4). However, afforesting the inherently nutrient-poor and sandy soils beneath savannas evidenced an improvement in soil P availability to plant, along with soil N status and C sequestration in both soil and biomass, with a potential impact on mitigating climate change.

We described the technology of preparation and injection of drill cuttings slurry into the underground horizon. The method of modeling and management of the process of disposal of drilling cuttings in the marine environment in a fuzzy environment with the use of fuzzy inference system, which helps to overcome the problems of scarcity and fuzziness of the original information due to the knowledge and experience of experts are proposed. The scheme and structure of the elements of the fuzzy inference system based on the Mamdani algorithm are given. The implementation of the fuzzy output system procedure was carried out in MatLab using Fuzzy Logic Toolbox. For the purpose of sustainable waste management in the process of oil production of marine fields, waste management tasks are formulated as a fuzzy mathematical programming problem, which takes into account economic and environmental criteria and many production constraints that may be fuzzy. Since the vector of such criteria is characterized by inconsistency, the developed methods for solving the set tasks of sustainable management are based on various tradeoff schemes modified to work in a fuzzy environment. The novelty and originality of the developed methods lies in the fact that, unlike the well-known methods of similar methods for solving fuzzy problems, they are set and solved without conversion to a system of equivalent deterministic problems, with-out losing the main part of the collected fuzzy information.

Due to the increased focus on the consequences of existing hazardous material on safety, health, and the environment, air quality and sufficient ventilation within a plant has been increasingly considered in the design stage. This paper investigates and analyzes methane and hydrogen sulfite dispersion and the effect of air ventilation within a CAD model of an offshore platform using computation fluids dynamics (CFD). In addition, this method and its principals could be utilized in any other hazardous environment. Simulations of possible hazardous events along with solutions for preventing or reducing their probability are presented to better assess the data. These investigations are performed by considering hypothetical hazardous scenarios which consist of gas leakages from pipes and process equipment under different conditions. After drafting a precise and highly detailed CAD model of the plant and performing CFD simulations on this model, the results of gas behaviors, dispersion, distribution, accumulation, and its possible hazards are investigated and analyzed. The larger amount of details of the actual plant model in CFD simulation are obtained by using a combination of different methods and software. These include PDMS for 3-D drawing of the plan, Rinoceros for geometrical integration of the process equipment and facilities, and Sharc Harpoon which meshes the model. Moreover, the probability of inducing ignitable or toxic concentration of gases within the atmosphere and air ventilation of the unit is considered by these investigations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A new, operationally geared radar QPE was developed and tested using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hydrometeorology Testbed executed during the 2005/06 cool season in Northern California. The new radar QPE scheme includes multiple steps for removing nonprecipitation echoes, constructing a seamless hybrid scan reflectivity field, applying vertical profile of reflectivity (VPR) corrections to the reflectivity, and converting the reflectivity into precipitation rates using adaptive Z-R relationships. Specific issues in radar rainfall accumulations were addressed, which include wind farm contaminations, blockage artifacts, and discontinuities due to radar overshooting. The new radar QPE was tested in a 6-month period of the 2005/06 cool season and showed significant improvements over the current operational radar QPE (43% reduction in bias and 30% reduction in root-mean-square error) when compared with gauges. In addition, the new technique minimizes various radar artifacts and produces a spatially continuous rainfall product. Such continuity is important for accurate hydrological model predictions. The new technique is computationally efficient and can be easily transitioned into operations. One of the largest remaining challenges is obtaining accurate radar QPE over the windward slopes of significant mountain ranges, where low-level orographic enhancement of precipitation is not resolved by the operational radars leading to underestimation.

Images with non-uniform brightness are visually limited due to low ambient light during imaging or excessive exposure, fogging, hazing, or a combination of these factors. As a result, a process of imaging improvement is highly complex with some conditions. Particularly, this issue is harmful for the underwater environments as well as its highly complexity. In this paper, we improve the underwater images from different environments by exploiting image processing techniques including elimination of fogging in the image, and improvement of contrast with combining super resolution methods which result in significant enhancement of the image quality. To remove fogging in the image enhancement method, a variational-based fusion method was proposed without increasing or decreasing image resolution to increase the adaptability of non-uniform backlight images. This approach is optimized by the bee colony algorithm. Additionally, weighting coefficient selection method is used for super resolution of image after adjusting contrast. The main reason for using hybrid contrast techniques includes the adaptive enhancement and color correction. The bee colony algorithm and weighting coefficient in super resolution due to the lack of hybrid methods in visually improved water images has been the subject of recent researches. The hybrid set has provided more effect on different images at various conditions. Having applied the algorithm set for low-quality visual image set of underwater, some analyses such as PSNR, MSE and SSIM are tested. Compared to similar solutions, the quality is significantly improved and highlighted the exhaustive operation of the algorithm.

Process technicians monitor and control industry equipment and processes. The process technician position has become much more complex in recent years, requiring more knowledge and skills in computing, teamwork, problem solving, regulatory compliance, and troubleshooting. Compounding the problem is the abnormally high number of retirements projected over the next 7 to 10 years in these industry sectors. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Labor projects growth in the oil and gas exploration and production and pharmaceutical industry sectors. Companies must have qualified workers who possess the skills and knowledge needed to perform successfully in this advanced job. Global competitiveness of process industries depends on the availability of quality education programs and student access to these educational opportunities. The Center for the Advancement of Process Technology (CAPT) was formed in 2002 as a national collaboration between education and industry in six process technology alliances - Alaska Process Industry Careers Consortium, Greater New Jersey Process Technology Alliance, Gulf Coast Process Technology Alliance, Louisiana Process Technology Alliance, Oklahoma Partnership of Industry and Education, and Southern California Chemical Technology Alliance. These alliances include industry partners in the chemical, refining, exploration and production, and pharmaceutical sectors such as BASF, BP, Chevron Texaco, ConocoPhillips, Dow Chemical, DuPont, Eastman Chemical, ExxonMobil, Lyondell-Citgo Refining, Merck, Oklahoma Gas and Electric and Shell. The Center has 39 national education partners in 18 states and the Virgin Islands and 3 international education partners. Intellectual Merit: The mission of CAPT is to support the ongoing development of a highly skilled, educated and diverse process technician workforce. CAPT fosters the development and enhancement of quality two-year degree programs based on industry-established standards. In 2002, partners identified the top 10 critical issues facing process technology education. To address these critical issues, CAPT focuses on 5 primary goals: 1. Develop curricula and instructional materials to support process technology education. 2. Provide professional development opportunities for community college and high school faculty who prepare students for careers in the process industries. 3. Support program development and improvement to serve student and industry needs. 4. Establish and foster partnerships linking industry, education, and government to advance process technology education. 5. Provide organizational and fiscal development to assure CAPT's health and sustainability. Broader Impacts: CAPT has worked with partners during the past three years to address key critical issues. A recent needs analysis confirmed that partners are satisfied with activities conducted as solutions for a subset of identified critical issues. In response to partners, CAPT is expanding and strengthening previously established activities.

It has a high content of organic matter, ranging from 2 to 20% (average 8-12%), and was deposited in a marine environment at an average water depth of 2220 to 2500 m where depositional conditions were of an intensely reducing nature. Deposition took place over a period of 8 to 10 million years mainly during Upper Jurassic times.This study reports the mineralogy of 83 core samples representative of the clayey-silty siliceous rocks of the Bazhenov Shale Formation (BSF) taken from six wells in the south-east of the west Siberian Basin. The mineralogy of most samples was found by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to be strikingly similar with most being dominated by quartz, and with albite, mica-like minerals (illite plus mixed-layer illite/smectite (I/S)) and pyrite commonly occurring in subsidiary amounts. Kaolinite and chlorite occur intermittently, usually in no great quantity. Throughout all six wells, plagioclase feldspar (albite) predominates over K-feldspar which is only of sporadic occurrence. The clay (<2 mu m) fraction of available core samples largely consists of illitic material comprising a combination of true illitic mica and mixed-layer I/S with R3 stacking. Both optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) show the BSF to be composed of a mixture of detrital and authigenic minerals. Thus, quartz occurs as a detrital mineral and as the crystallized product of radiolarian tests subsequent to deposition. The micaceous (muscovitic) material seen in thin section is clearly of terrigenous origin but the fine-grained illitic material is considered to be at least partly diagenetic. With regard to feldspars, although thin sections show some to be detrital, it is considered that albite is also likely to be a diagenetic mineral, as it is in many sandstone reservoirs. In many of the core samples albite is the only feldspar detectable and it is improbable that provenance could yield feldspar detritus consisting only of pure albite over such an extended period of time. Other minerals in the BSF must also be regarded as diagenetic rather than detrital. This is certainly true of the carbonate minerals and pyrite, and the book-like aggregates and euhedral morphology of kaolinite observed by SEM and TEM are also indicative of a diagenetic origin.Finally, the illitic clay mineralogy of the BSF is considered in a general way in the context of their permeability, particularly as it relates to their anisotropic structure and pore water chemistry.

Terrestrial Wireless Sensor Networks (TWSN) and UWSNs share many characteristics apart from having different communication medium and working environment as UWSNs face the challenges of low-bandwidth, long latency, and high bit error rate. These have caused for UWSNs many problems such as low reliability, packet retransmission, and high consumption of energy. To alleviate the aforementioned issues, many techniques have been proposed. However, most of them merely consider the issue of hotspot which occurs due to the unbalanced transmission of load on sensor nodes near the surface sink. In this article, we propose a multi-layer cluster-based Energy Efficient (MLCEE) protocol for UWSNs to address the issue of hotspot and energy consumption. There are different stages in MLCEE, first of which is the division of the whole network in layers, the second is clustering of the nodes at same layers. In the last stage of transmission, the cluster head (CH) selects the next hop among the CHs based on greater fitness value, small Hopid and small layer number. To mitigate the issue of hotspot, the first layer remains un-clustered and any node in the first layer transfers data to the sink directly while cluster heads (CHs) are selected based on Bayesian Probability and residual energy. The simulation results of the proposed technique, done using MATLAB, have revealed that MLCEE achieves superior performance than the other techniques with regard to the network lifetime, energy consumption, and data transmission amount.",,,,,,,,,53,1,0,0,1,0,53,,,2169-3536,,,,,,,,,,,"Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Informat & Elect, Beijing 100081, Peoples R ChinaUniv Tabuk, Sensor Networks & Cellular Syst Res Ctr, Tabuk 71491, Saudi ArabiaBeijing Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R ChinaHohai Univ, Coll Internet Things IoT Engn, Changzhou 213022, Peoples R China",,,,2019-07-16,WOS:000473466300001,,

The reservoirs consist of weak chalk. The weak chalk results in significant reservoir compaction, exceeding 10 m in places, and corresponding seafloor subsidence, exceeding 6 m above the center of the field. Previous papers have documented the increasing drilling challenges in the shale overburden at Valhall because of the subsidence. This paper presents the computational-geomechanics technology developed and implemented to assist drilling into the highly depleted and compacted crest from the new water-injection platform at Valhall. The work focuses on handling the stress changes occurring in the overburden above a compacting reservoir and not the more traditional situation associated with depletion-induced fracture-gradient changes in the reservoir itself. The technology is based on a history-matched full-field finite-element-based geomechanics model to calculate stresses, strains, and displacements. The results are exported from the finite-element model (FEM) to a geological modeling software to perform wellbore-stability calculations using BP best practices for prediction of wellbore stability. In this environment, one can also easily use as supporting data 4D seismic from the permanent life-of-field seismic array at Valhall. By calculating the operational mud-weight window over a high risk interval in the overburden, a good correlation to historical nonproductive time (NPT) was found. The methodology is used in detailed well planning where moving the well 50 m in one direction is the difference between problem-free drilling or huge drilling challenges. The paper presents the first application of this technology on a new water injector delivered 60 days ahead of schedule with reduced costs of approximately USD 20 million and with avoidance of a potential train wreck that could have cost USD 60 million.",,,,,SPE/IADC Drilling Conference and ExhibitionSPE/IADC Drilling Conference and Exhibition,"MAR 17-19, 2009MAR 17-19, 2009",,"Amsterdam, NETHERLANDSAmsterdam, NETHERLANDS",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1064-6671,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2010-12-01,WOS:000285438600011,,

A limited number of models have been developed to evaluate crack initiation or fatigue crack velocities by relatively simple analytical equations. Considerable effort also has been undertaken in numerical modeling of special hydrogen transport phenomena (i.e., the accumulation of hydrogen at a blunting crack tip). In the past, such simulations have accounted only for stationary cracks while the effect of crack propagation on the hydrogen concentration profile could not be considered appropriately. However, the increasing application of materials in sour environments, such as low-carbon martensitic stainless steels in North Sea oil and gas production, requires consistent and practically applicable EAC models considering hydrogen degradation effects for component lifetime evaluation. Thus, a numerical model for hydrogen-assisted cracking has been developed, which particularly considers the geometrical effects of crack propagation on hydrogen uptake and diffusion alongside and ahead of the crack. Simulations were based on respective finite element calculations of the hydrogen and respective stress-strain distribution using a commercially available program. To demonstrate the applicability of the model to engineering problems, crack initiation and propagation in a supermarterisitic stainless steel, four-point bend specimen was simulated as a first approach. In the present contribution, the modeling procedure was described.

We conclude from analysis of paleodata and climate-biome model output that terrestrial C exchanges since the last glacial maximum (LGM) were dominated by slow processes of C sequestration in soils, possibly modified by C starvation and reduced water use efficiency of trees during the LGM. Human intrusion into the C cycle was immeasurably small. These processes produced an averaged C sink in the terrestrial biosphere on the order of 0.05 Pg yr-1 during the past 10,000 years.In contrast, future C cycling will be dominated by human activities, not only from increasing C release with burning of fossil fuels, and but also from indirect effects which increase C storage in the terrestrial biosphere (CO2 fertilization; management of C by technology and afforestation; synchronous early forest succession from widespread cropland abandonment) and decrease C storage in the biosphere (synchronous forest dieback from climatic stress; warming-induced oxidation of soil C; slowed forest succession; unfinished tree life cycles; delayed immigration of trees; increasing agricultural land use). Comparison of the positive and negative C flux processes involved suggests that if the C sequestration processes are important, they likely will be so during the next few decades, gradually being counteracted by the C release processes.Based only on tabulating known or predicted C flux effects of these processes, we could not determine if the earth will act as a significant C source from dominance by natural C cycle processes, or as a C sink made possible only by excellent earth stewardship in the next 50 to 100 yrs. Our subsequent analysis concentrated on recent estimates of C release from forest replacement by increased agriculture. Those results suggest that future agriculture may produce an additional 0.6 to 1.2 Pg yr-1 loss during the 50 to 100 years to CO2 doubling if the current ratio of farmed to potentially-farmed land is maintained; or a greater loss, up to a maximum of 1.4 to 2.8 Pg yr-1 if all potential agricultural land is farmed.",,,,,,,,,41,5,0,0,8,0,45,,,0049-6979,1573-2932,,,,,,,,,,"LUND UNIV, DEPT PLANT ECOL, S-22361 LUND, SWEDENNATL INST PUBL HLTH & ENVIRONM PROTECT, 3720 BA BILTHOVEN, NETHERLANDSPOTSDAM INST CLIMATE IMPACT RES, O-1500 POTSDAM, GERMANY",,,,1993-10-01,WOS:A1993LZ84600042,,

The archive will provide the capability to preserve and enable discovery of all products of NSF Arctic Science Section funded research, including data, metadata, software, documents, and provenance that link these in a coherent knowledge model, using infrastructure from the DataONE federation of data repositories. This cooperative agreement will support a comprehensive archive of data from Arctic research funded by the NSF Arctic Sciences section, which necessitates a system that can handle the complexity, heterogeneity, and volume of data generated in the Arctic. By building upon successful repository infrastructures that already handle these kinds of data the repository will come online at project inception, be immediately useful to researchers, and undergo continuous improvement through feature expansions and refinement. Novel features in the archive will enable critical linkages between data, science, and policy. A data science fellowship program, training workshops, and a short course will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for at least 190 graduate and undergraduate students. Selection will promote underrepresented groups with the goal to increase the diversity of data scientists in the research community. Students returning to their home universities will help communicate data science issues and will effect a large change across science disciplines nationally. In addition, the new infrastructure and data will have a lasting impact on Arctic research and policy globally. Arctic science has policy and societal importance that are disproportionally large, partly because of the impacts of climate change in the Arctic, and partly because of the resource implications on the oil, gas, and other industries that are affected by these changes. Digital research data will serve as a foundation for new insights that impact both science and society. Data storage will be accomplished utilizing the UC Santa Barbara KNB Data Repository (KNB, formerly the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity) for its versioning and accessioning to enable an effective archive. Data will be replicated to administratively diverse institutions at the KNB, the Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and the Amazon cloud, as this is critical to long-term preservation. DataONE researcher-facing tools will be adapted to provide convenient pathways to document and archive diverse data formats as part of scientists' normal workflow. This infrastructure will be supported with an outstanding set of community services, including data discovery tools, metadata assessment and editing, data cleansing and integration, data management consulting, and user help-desk services. A data recovery team will engage the community to prioritize and rescue critical Arctic data from past NSF research that is currently inaccessible. In addition to the traditional functions of a data archive, modern cloud-based data facilities will support detailed provenance tracking of the science process, data usage and citation reporting, linkages among heterogeneous disciplines, and direct linkages between the literature, investigators, and funding programs. Usability and outreach specialists will engage an interdisciplinary Arctic Science Advisory Board and the broader polar science communities to drive continuous improvement by evaluating tools and services, gathering requirements and use cases, and prioritizing improvements to infrastructure and service offerings of the archive. Usage data and usability studies will drive an iterative cycle of assessment and development to improve operations.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1546024,,,,,,,,University of California-Santa Barbara,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13794917,,

Previous studies revealed strong relationships between LBW rate and several socio-demographic factors, including ethnicity, maternal age, and family income. However, studies of association between LBW rate and environmental risk factors remain infrequent.Study methods: We retrieved a geo-referenced data set, containing 7216 individual records of children born in 2015 in the Haifa Bay Area in Israel. Using this dataset, we analysed factors affecting LBW prevalence by applying two alternative techniques: analysis of LBW rates in small census area (SCAs) and more recently developed double kernel density (DKD) relative risk (RR) estimates.Results: In the SCA models, LBW rate was found to be associated with proximity to petrochemical industries (B= - 0.26, 95%CI= - 0.30, -0.22), road density (B = 0.05, 95%)CI = 0.02, 0.08), distance to the seashore (B=0.17, 95%CI = 0.14, 0.22), PM2.5 (B=0.06, 95%CI = 0,04, 0.09) and NOx (B= 0.10, 95%CI= 0.06, 0.13) exposure estimates. Although similar factors emerged in the DKD models as well, in most cases, the effects of these factors in the latter models were found to be stronger: proximity to petrochemical industries (B= -0.48, 95%CI= - 0.51, - 0.30), road density (B =0.05, 95%CI= 0.02, 0.08), distance to the seashore (B=0.24, 95%CI = 0.21, 0.27), PM2.5 (B=0.08, 95%CI = 0.05, 0.10) and NOx (B=0.20, 95%CI = 0.17, 0.23) exposure estimates. In addition, elevation above the sea level was found to be statistically significant in spatial dependence models estimated for both DKD and SCA rates (P < 0.01).Conclusion: The analysis revealed an excess LBW rate in residential areas located close to petrochemical industries and a protective effect of seashore proximity and elevation above the sea level on the LBW rate.

The production capacity of a shipyard may vary depending on how they are operated. Particularly in the case of ships, it is important to efficiently utilize the limited space because they have large blocks, which are semi-finished products made during the shipbuilding process. To efficiently utilize the space, the locations of blocks must be determined taking various factors into consideration when arranging them in the workshop or stock area. This problem can be described as a spatial arrangement problem. However, as the items with fixed arrival dates and departure dates occupy the space for certain periods before being released from shipyards, this problem must be approached from the perspective of a spatial arrangement planning problem for certain periods and not as a simple spatial arrangement problem. In this study, various shipyard spatial arrangement planning problems are classified and defined based on arrangement areas, arrangement items, algorithms, and evaluation factors. In addition, taking the increasing sizes of shipyard blocks into consideration, evaluation factors and algorithms are proposed so that the shape of the free space and the characteristics of unplaced blocks can be considered in the spatial arrangement planning problems of large blocks. The performances of the proposed evaluation factors and algorithms were verified using block data generated by analyzing existing shipyard data product information.

A watershed model should provide temporal and spatial distribution of runoff response for a given storm. GIS applicability in watershed modeling is increasing due to the availability of spatial information, fast processors and interfaces such as ArcHydro, HEC-GeoHMS, and HEC-GeoRAS linking hydrologic and hydraulic models to the ArcGIS environment.Soil Conservation Service methods are used widely in hydrologic models. Several parameters inherent to these empirical methods are average values derived from various watershed conditions. These average values overestimate peak flows for flat, low-lying coastal terrains. The design of flood control structures based on these flow values allow more post-development discharge, make the system more hydraulically efficient, increase project costs, and cause flooding for areas downstream. In this study, Wreck Pond Brook Watershed (WPBW), a coastal New Jersey area was used for sensitivity studies of the initial abstraction ratio and peak rate factor. The HEC-HMS modeling results indicated use of a lower peak rate factor (e.g. 284) and 5% initial abstraction ratio provided better characterization of stream response. These updated parameters provide new technical information for improving stormwater management in coastal areas.An important limitation in hydraulic modeling is the economic constraint on cross-section spacing for surveying channels and floodplains. Applying GIS techniques in hydraulic modeling eliminated this constraint. Floodplain analysis was done using ArcGIS, HEC-GeoRAS and HEC-RAS. Detailed elevation data (LIDAR information from Monmouth County) was incorporated into the HEC-RAS using GIS models. This innovation was important for improving model efficiency. The modeled floodplain demonstrated close agreement to the observed floodplain for the October 2005 storm and showed greater accuracy compared to the FEMA floodplain for the 100-year storm. This study validated use of LIDAR elevation data in floodplain analysis for the second-order streams in coastal NJ.Finally, an approach was demonstrated using modeled floodplain and HEC-HMS for flood control analysis. This study presents an innovative watershed modeling approach using GIS models while addressing the limitations of traditional hydrologic and hydraulic methods using WPBW as an example.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-05-17,DRCI:DATA2018091012903283,,

A non-ionic surfactant named poloxyproylenated-poloxyethyleneated hydrogenated tallow alkyl secondary amine (PPHTA) was prepared. The relationship between its interfacial tension and temperature and the result of conductivity measurement showed that its phase inversion temperature (PIT) was about 60 degrees C and it had good interfacial activity. Then, OWPF was treated by PPHTA. It was interesting that the PPHTA had a good performance for treatment of OWPF at the temperature which was higher than its PIT. At 63 degrees C, after the treatment by PPHTA at dosage of 800 mg/L, the oil content in OWPF changed from 4724 mg/L to 72 mg/L. The reason was discussed and it was proposed that the PPHTA can displace the natural active agents in OWPF and form a new oil-PPHTA-water emulsion. When the temperature increased, the hydrophilic- lipophilic deviation (HLD) of oil-PPHTA-water moved to zero and the emulsion stability decreased. At the PIT, the most unstable emulsion was formed and it was destroyed after stirring. In addition, it is important to note that the floc of PPHTA was composed of oil drops and was not viscous.

Similarities are evident between the As (V)-goethite and AsM-oil-goethite systems: i) Adsorption is fast and saturation is achieved within 180 min, ii) Reaction rates approximate to a pseudo second order rate expression and range between 6.5 and 52.3 x 10(-4) g/mu mol/min, iii) Adsorption mechanisms are best described with a Langmuir model, and iv) Adsorption capacity rises with decreasing pH reflecting the increase of positive charges on the goethite surface. A difference is discernable in that the adsorption of As(V) is reduced significantly when the goethite is coated with oil. The similar experimental macroscopic observations for both systems, i.e., Langmuir model fits, reaction rates, and the effect of pH and ionic strength (I), suggest that the oil reduces the effective and/or reactive surface area. The zeta potential () indicates that the oil coating also changes the surface charge of the goethite, shifting the pH point of zero charge from 9.8 to about 3, thus contributing to the reduced As(V) adsorption. FTIR spectra show that As(V) interacts with the carbonyl functional groups of the oil. Our results suggest that oil-covered goethite significantly reduces the adsorption of As(V) and this points to a potentially significant indirect effect of oil on the cycling of As(V) and other oxyanions in oil polluted waters.

Nevertheless, the mode and tempo of changes in continental weathering across this interval remains highly debated, leading to considerable uncertainty about the main causes of these perturbations. In this study we present calcium isotope measurements (delta Ca-44/40) of well-preserved brachiopods and bulk rock samples from the hemipelagic strata of Pliensbachian-Toarcian age of Peniche in Portugal in order to constrain changes in the calcium cycle and hence changes in continental weathering during the early Toarcian. The data reveal a similar trend as carbon isotope data from the same section and show negative excursions of about 0.5 parts per thousand at the Pliensbachian-Toarcian transition (PI-To) and at the base of the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE) interval. The comparison of delta Ca-44/40 ratios recorded in brachiopods and bulk rock corrected for variable dolomite contribution indicates that these excursions reflect changes in the global isotopic composition of seawater rather than changes in the dominant mineralogy of calcifying organisms or in hydrological budget of the considered basin. Box modeling results suggest that the PI-To and T-OAE delta Ca-44/40 excursions can be explained by a transient 90% decrease of carbonate accumulation due to seawater acidification followed by a 500% increase in continental weathering rates. The sharp increases in continental weathering inferred from the delta Ca-44/40 ratios seem overall consistent with lower Toarcian sedimentological and biotic records that document rapid crises in carbonate production followed by episodes of increased calcium carbonate burial. Nevertheless, the maximum of carbonate burial recorded by most NW European basinal successions occurs several hundreds of kyrs after that predicted by box modeling results. This mismatch either implies that the European records of carbonate accumulation do not reflect global trends or that the fundamental processes related to the removal of excess alkalinity caused by increased continental weathering are more complex than previously appreciated. Based on the amount of Ca input simulated by box modeling, the injection of tens of thousands of gigatons of carbon with an isotopic composition (delta C-13) comprised between -6 parts per thousand and -14 parts per thousand appears as the most likely causes of the delta C-13 excursions characterizing these two events. These results indicate that environmental and biotic changes of the PI-To and T-OAE were mainly caused a cascade of environmental changes triggered by the massive carbon emissions from the Karoo-Ferrar volcanism.

Occasionally, deficits in the institutional environment foster the pursuit of quick wins through violations of corporate governance rules. To resolve the tension between short- and long-term objectives, good institutions are required that provide incentives for sustainable behavior without endangering corporations' short-term competitiveness.

These events have been linked to variations in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. However, the factors that lead to abrupt transitions between strong and weak circulation regimes remain unclear. Here we show that, in a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean model, gradual changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations can trigger abrupt climate changes, associated with a regime of bi-stability of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation under intermediate glacial conditions. We find that changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations alter the transport of atmospheric moisture across Central America, which modulates the freshwater budget of the North Atlantic and hence deep-water formation. In our simulations, a change in atmospheric CO2 levels of about 15 ppmv-comparable to variations during Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles containing Heinrich events-is sufficient to cause transitions between a weak stadial and a strong interstadial circulation mode. Because changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation are thought to alter atmospheric CO2 levels, we infer that atmospheric CO2 may serve as a negative feedback to transitions between strong and weak circulation modes.",,,,,,,,,95,7,0,0,12,0,106,,,1752-0894,1752-0908,,,,,,,,,,"Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bussestr 24, D-27570 Bremerhaven, GermanyQingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Geol, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R ChinaCardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, WalesUniv Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, Leobener Str, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",,,,2017-07-01,WOS:000404621000015,,

While the cost of sequestering a ton of CO2 with dedicated chloralkali plants is unacceptably high, it is economically and environmentally sound to replace an existing European Cl-2 plant (consuming fossils) with a solar-powered plant in Algeria. If the Algerian plant uses a new, more efficient chloralkali process, it will be competitive with existing European plants even at the current low market value of the carbon emission credits.

Therefore, we should expect a relation between the sedimentary basin, the exploitation of its fossil fuels, and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide is the dominant greenhouse gas resulting from the burning of fossil fuels, and it comprises more than half of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions. Among the methods proposed for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, specifically carbon dioxide, is disposal into porous formations deep in sedimentary basins. This includes injection into hydrocarbon reservoirs to enhance oil and gas recovery and the long-term sequestration in aquifers. The methodology for proving the latter concept has been developed in the Alberta Basin, Canada. It is now being practiced in the North Sea and considered in Indonesia. A further development is the concept of injecting carbon dioxide, from the burning of fossil fuels, into coal-beds to remove methane. This would have the dual result of increasing the production of methane, a more environmentally friendly fossil fuel than coal or oil, and using waste carbon dioxide to a useful purpose, While burning the recovered methane will result in more carbon dioxide, clearly this additional carbon dioxide can either be used to recover more methane or be disposed of underground in suitable aquifers. There is, thus, a serendipitous association of sedimentary basins, their contained fossil fuels and the means of exploiting or disposing of the greenhouse gases produced from the fossil fuels.

Simultaneously, there is increasing pressure on reforested areas to achieve multiple co-benefits, e.g. maximizing carbon storage, ameliorating environmental degradation and promoting biodiversity objectives, all while not adversely affecting community values, such as agricultural production. Here, we review the myriad of biophysical risks posed by climate change to reforested areas while documenting management actions and policies that can enhance both the resistance and resilience of reforested areas to such risks. While it is difficult to buffer vegetation against the direct effects of climate change, such as elevated temperature and changed precipitation patterns, it is possible to manage some of the indirect effects, such as wildfire, drought and insect defoliation. Methods for reducing the vulnerability of reforested areas range from site-specific management actions, particularly around design and location, through to regional and national scale initiatives, such as vulnerability assessments and decision support tools. The complexity of objectives and risks posed to reforested areas means that it is vitally important to evaluate outcomes from across the current estate of reforested areas. However, there is currently no national protocol in place in Australia to track, monitor or evaluate the outcomes of reforestation. Thus, we recommend the establishment of a national framework for analyzing and supporting the growing range of reforestation activities.",,,,,,,,,14,1,0,0,11,0,17,,,0378-1127,1872-7042,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, AustraliaWestern Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, AustraliaStellenbosch Univ, Dept Forest & Wood Sci, Private Bag X1, ZA-7800 Matieland, South AfricaCSIRO Land & Water, Sandy Bay, Tas 7005, AustraliaCSIRO Land & Water Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000437967900043,,

However, land is limiting, creating interest in a rapidly growing aquatic farming sector of seaweed aquaculture [3-5]. Synthesizing data from scientific literature, we assess the extent and cost of scaling seaweed aquaculture to provide sufficient CO(2)eq sequestration for several climate change mitigation scenarios, with a focus on the food sector-a major source of greenhouse gases [6]. Given known ecological constraints (nutrients and temperature), we found a substantial suitable area (ca. 48 million km(2)) for seaweed farming, which is largely unfarmed. Within its own industry, seaweed could create a carbon-neutral aquaculture sector with just 14% (mean = 25%) of current seaweed production (0.001% of suitable area). At a much larger scale, we find seaweed culturing extremely unlikely to offset global agriculture, in part due to production growth and cost constraints. Yet offsetting agriculture appears more feasible at a regional level, especially areas with strong climate policy, such as California (0.065% of suitable area). Importantly, seaweed farming can provide other benefits to coastlines affected by eutrophic, hypoxic, and/or acidic conditions [7, 8], creating opportunities for seaweed farming to act as charismatic carbon that serves multiple purposes.

This study also attempts to echo the importance of looking through a new window to the process of energy opting in the maritime industries to comply with International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations. With giving this awareness to the maritime society the new investment can be directed to resources that effectively keep the maritime economy growing and can also help build a sustainable future. In order to find the best answer, we need to seek alternative solutions that will sustain shipping's competitive edge. In the first phase, the impact of a declining EROI gas is investigated. Then, in the second phase, to be able to find an optimal area to run the vessels, we apply the Computerized Engine Application System (CEAS) in order to predict the engine performance of different container vessels and outlined fuel consumption in various market and technical situations. Since the process found is a non-linear system, this paper attempts to investigate the ongoing trend of the EROI of LNG in applying a Net Present Value (NPV) as a simulation method in order to observe the system to which technical variables or legal frameworks is more sensitive. In the following order, we first characterise the uncertainty faced by policy-makers and complexity dynamics implications for investment decision-makers and technology adoption. The practical relevance here of the proposed applied methodology is subsequently discussed in reference to four scenarios relating to the above areas and introduces the most beneficial area between different vital variables and constraints.

Data supported an earlier claim that a critical potential drop must be exceeded to initiate crevice corrosion. Steady-state crevice corrosion propagation was found to be under ohmic control. Chlorine decreased the time required for initiation and possibly raised propagation rates in ASTM artificial ocean water. Addition of molybdate (MoO42-) to ocean water (simulating the dissolution of alloyed molybdenum [Mo]) delayed initiation and reduced propagation rates temporarily, but not sufficiently to explain fully the inhibiting effects of alloyed Mo. Beneficial effects on crevice corrosion susceptibility of alloyed Mo and equivalent chromium (Cr-90) concentration were examined critically in the context of the two models by comparing alloys 625, C-276 (UNS N10276), and G-3 (UNS N06985) in several simulated CCS. Alloyed Mo lowered passive current densities, decreased the tendency for the primary passive potential to increase with increasing acidity, and lowered the anodic dissolution rate in the active polarization region.

Strategies that increase growth rates (fertilization and the use of genetically improved growing stock) and a fixed reduction in the harvest level were analyzed to determine the magnitude of the difference in terms of stored Carbon. The performance of the harvest reduction strategies (fixed harvest level, increased rotation age, and increased area in reserves) was analyzed in more detail to determine if there is a reason for the forest manager to favor one of these strategies over the others, and whether this choice is the same for both forests considered in this paper. Strategies that reduce harvest levels stored significantly more Carbon over the 100-year planning horizon as compared to strategies that increase growth rates. For both forest estates, little difference was observed between the harvest reduction strategies (less than 4.1% over 100 years). However, the fixed harvest level strategy allows the forest manager to shift the harvesting to various areas in order to respond to an uncertain future while accommodating the various management objectives of the forest estate.

To help protect this resource and to support a wide range of decision-making, the Gulf of Mexico Ocean Observing System (GCOOS) is being built to be a sustained network that provides integrated coastal and ocean data from a diverse array of data sources in real time, near real time, and historically. GCOOS is 1 of the 11 regional components of the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (U.S. IOOS). Because of the very limited resources available to date, the GCOOS Regional Association (GCOOS-RA), which is working to build the GCOOS, has not deployed any of its own observing systems. That, coupled with strong volunteer participation, has led the GCOOS-RA to focus its efforts on integrating existing federal and non-federal (regional, state, local, academic, and private) assets and data. The GCOOS-RA is working to adapt and expand the GCOOS to address data gaps identified by stakeholders and to apply the lessons learned from events such as the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, harmful algal blooms (HABs), Gulf hurricanes, and hypoxia. The contributions of GCOOS demonstrate the value of a sustained U.S. IOOS and provide specific lessons necessary for the successful build-out of the system in the Gulf of Mexico. However, the lessons also demonstrate the importance of applying additional resources to improve GCOOS' ability to meet stakeholder needs such as in response to environmental events. A full, comprehensive GCOOS, exclusive of federal assets, is estimated to cost roughly $22 M for capital and $20-25 M/year for operation and maintenance (O&M) in the near term with approximately an additional $25 M in capital to complete the build-out and $35-50 M/year in O&M costs to maintain the system-an excellent value when compared to the billions of dollars of economic impact of four major industries in the Gulf of Mexico: oil and gas, tourism and recreation, fishing, and shipping.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,0,6,,,0025-3324,,,,,,,,,,,"Gulf Mexico Coastal Ocean Observing Syst, Mandeville, LA USATexas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Gulf Mexico Coastal Ocean Observing Syst,,,2013-05-29,WOS:000316585600011,,

Scanning electron microscopy observations showed a change in microfilament organized at the CC's apex, with the appearance of some actin filament aggregates. Higher cadmium concentrations (0.03 and 0.015 mg/L) did not alter such reorganization. Microtubules weren't significantly affected by similar exposures.

If the chemical signature of fracking is detectable in streams, it can be employed to bookmark potential impacts. We evaluated benthic biofilm community composition as a proxy for stream chemistry so as to segregate anthropogenic signatures in eight Arkansas River catchments. In doing so, we tested the hypothesis that fracking characteristics in study streams are statistically distinguishable from those produced by agriculture or urbanization.Results: Four tributary catchments had UNG-wells significantly more dense and near to our sampling sites and were grouped as 'potentially-impacted catchment zones' (PICZ). Four others were characterized by significantly larger forested area with greater slope and elevation but reduced pasture, and were classified as 'minimally-impacted' (MICZ). Overall, 46 bacterial phyla/141 classes were identified, with 24 phyla (52%) and 54 classes (38%) across all samples. PICZ-sites were ecologically more variable than MICZ-sites, with significantly greater nutrient levels (total nitrogen, total phosphorous), and elevated Cyanobacteria as bioindicators that tracked these conditions. PICZ-sites also exhibited elevated conductance (a correlate of increased ion concentration) and depressed salt-intolerant Spartobacteria, suggesting the presence of brine as a fracking effect. Biofilm communities at PICZ-sites were significantly less variable than those at MICZ-sites.Conclusions: Study streams differed by Group according to morphology, land use, and water chemistry but not in biofilm community structure. Those at PICZ-sites covaried according to anthropogenic impact, and were qualitatively similar to communities found at sites disturbed by fracking. The hypothesis that fracking signatures in study streams are distinguishable from those produced by other anthropogenic effects was statistically rejected. Instead, alterations in biofilm community composition, as induced by fracking, may be less specific than initially predicted, and thus more easily confounded by agriculture and urbanization effects (among others). Study streams must be carefully categorized with regard to the magnitude and extent of anthropogenic impacts. They must also be segregated with statistical confidence (as herein) before fracking impacts are monitored.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,7,0,10,,,1471-2180,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USAUniv Arkansas, Dept Food Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72703 USAUniv Cent Arkansas, Dept Biol, Conway, AR 72035 USA",,,,2017-02-03,WOS:000393329000001,28158975,

Research has indicated that the Yingshan Formation underwent a 7-11 Ma exposure during the middle Caledonian Period, resulting in large-scale karst pores and caves. However, the continental freshwater karst model cannot adequately explain the origin and distribution of karst pores and caves. In order to develop a more accurate karst model to guide petroleum exploration in the region, we analyzed the karst morphology, cave development statistics, and paleokarst environments. Karst reservoir characteristics were analyzed on the basis of the following analysis: (1) Karst morphological analyses based on core description and formation micro-imager (FMI) log analyses. The results showed that alveolar-like and Swiss cheese-like solution pores, spongy dissolution zones, pit cenotes, and small continuous karst caves developed in the Yingshan Formation. (2) The statistical analysis of pore and cave characteristics indicated that most of the karst pores and caves developed within 50 m below the unconformity where the average height of these features ranged from 0.1 to 3.0 m and their widths ranged up to 100 m. These pores and caves were commonly filled with gravel, clay, and calcite. Horizontal well and seismic attribute analysis indicated that these pores and caves were distributed over a large area. In plain view, the karst pore-cave system is comprised of cross-linked anastomosing networks of horizontal cave passages. And (3) Cathode luminescence and electron microprobe analyses suggested that clay filling within karst caves was freshwater related, while calcite filling was of seawater origin. Cements within solution pores showed three phases of luminescence, suggesting an alternating freshwater and seawater environment. Based on these characteristics, the karsts of the Yingshan Formation in the Tazhong area are interpreted to be similar to the eogenetic karsts in the Yucatan Peninsula of modern Mexico. Accordingly, this study indicates that the pore-caves of the Yingshan Formation can be subdivided into three sections. Further, the development and filling of these pore-cave sections are interpreted to have formed by eogenetic mixed-water karstification during three phases of relatively stable sea level in a coastal margin environment.",,,,,,,,,8,1,0,0,0,0,9,,,,2075-163X,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Karst Geol, Karst Dynam Lab, MLR & GZAR, Guilin 541004, Peoples R ChinaChengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610059, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaChengdu Univ Technol, Inst Sedimentary Geol, Chengdu 610059, Sichuan, Peoples R China",,,,2018-09-10,WOS:000443257900035,,

Most studies have demonstrated noise compliance to applicable standards by focusing on a combination of treatments and specifications, with less consideration on control technology feasibility, ranking, and cost-effectiveness. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) prohibits natural gas facilities from emitting day-night noise levels in excess of 55 dB(A) (equivalent to 24-hr continuous level of 49 dB(A)) at nearby receivers. A case study was conducted to evaluate a top-down approach to reduce noise at a typical LNG peak-shaving facility under normal operating conditions, accounting for technical feasibility, control effectiveness, and cost implications. A modeling approach (International Organization for Standardization standard ISO 9613-2) was used to predict and evaluate the facility's noise reduction potential. The study found that the strategy could achieve feasible and environmentally effective reductions up to 11 dB(A) at 500 m from the facility by first identifying source groups with highest-emitting sources and then targeting major noise source contributors per group. This approach is cost-effective because the FERC noise goals can still be achieved by avoiding unnecessary control costs associated with lower-ranked sources. The study identified the following four source groups as the highest noise emitters: (1) liquefaction and instrument air, (2) boil-off gas (BOG) compression, (3) glycol water system (air coolers), and (4) pretreatment. Of all the treatments evaluated, installation of enhanced silencers for gas turbine (GT) package-as well as construction of an acoustical building for the BOG compressors and drivers-resulted in the greatest noise reduction at nearby receivers. The study notes that incremental treatment costs presented in this paper are approximate estimates that may vary depending on factors such as facility size and region. Implications: This study assessed potential noise reductions associated with implementing a top-down noise control strategy on a typical LNG peak-shaving facility. The study determined the top-down noise control strategy could achieve feasible and environmentally effective reductions up to 11 decibels at receivers within 500 m from the facility's center. As LNG suppliers need to support potential supply disruptions, some regions of the US, including New England and Gulf Coast with projected increase in LNG exports and growing needs from power sector, may find information in this study useful with regard to evaluating and prioritizing noise reduction potential of their LNG peak-shaving facilities.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,1096-2247,2162-2906,,,,,,,,,,"Impact Assessment & Planning Environm Resources M, 180 Admiral Cochrane Dr,Suite 400, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA",Impact Assessment & Planning Environm Resources M,,,2019-06-14,WOS:000469541400001,30810487,

In CBR, the Frame method is used to define case representation, and the HEM (Heterogeneous Euclidean-Overlap Metric) is improved to define the similarity of case properties. In GA, we introduce an Improved Genetic Algorithm (IGA) that achieves case adaptation, in which technologies include the Multi-Parameter Cascade Code method, the Small Section method for generation of an initial population, the Multi-Factor Integrated Fitness Function, and Niche technology for genetic operations including selection, crossover, and mutation. In ANN, a modified back-propagation algorithm is employed to train the algorithm to quickly improve system preparedness. Through the analysis of 32 fabricated oil spill cases, an oil spill emergency preparedness system based on the integration of CBR, GA and ANN is introduced. In particular, the development of ANN is presented and analyzed. The paper also discusses the efficacy of our integration approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Efforts to develop nonaqueous alternatives have focused on carbon dioxide as a tunable working fluid even though the full environmental and production impacts of a switch away from water have yet to be quantified. Here we report on a life cycle analysis of using either water or CO2 for gas production in the Marcellus shale. The results show that CO2-based fluids, as currently conceived, could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 400% (with sequestration credit) and water consumption by 80% when compared to conventional water-based fluids. These benefits are offset by a 44% increase in net energy use when compared to slickwater fracturing as well as logistical barriers resulting from the need to move and store large volumes of CO2. Scenario analyses explore the outlook for CO2, which under best-case conditions could eventually reduce life cycle energy, water, and greenhouse gas (GHG) burdens associated with fracturing. To achieve these benefits, it will be necessary to reduce CO2 sourcing and transport burdens and to realize opportunities for improved energy recovery, averted water quality impacts, and carbon storage.

The main objective of this work is to develop neural network controllers able to regulate the annulus bottomhole pressure under pipe connection procedure, kick and lost circulation disturbances. For this purpose, an experimental drilling unit was built, depicting the oil well drilling process primordial characteristics. Besides, real oil well offshore data were employed for validating the neural network controllers. Neural networks were built for predicting the direct plant dynamics (inverse neural network controller) and the inverse plant dynamics (direct neural network controller).

In numerical approaches, questions remain on the selection of turbulence models and turbine representations, since more realistic but computationally expensive methodologies not necessarily produce an improvement on the understanding of these flows. In this investigation we perform simulations of turbine arrays to study the hydrodynamics of wakes and their interactions, comparing with experiments and previous simulations. We propose a methodology that couples detached-eddy simulations (DES) with Blade Element Momentum (BEM), showing that by capturing the dynamically-rich coherent structures of the flow, we improve the description of mean quantities and turbine performance.

On the basis of correlations between areas, the broad facies belts, palaeogeographies and tectonic frameworks for the Mesozoic epochs were established. The arealy extensive Tertiary limestone tableland and Tertiary volcanics, however, masked more local underlying pre-Cenozoic major structural features.Extensive oil exploration drilling backed by regional and/or detailed geophysical surveys (increasingly based on seismic surveys) from the late 1970s, have gradually unraveled a complex Mesozoic tectonic history which had given rise to the formation of a number of NW-SE and E-W trending rift basins and depressions; these were initiated mainly in the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, principally by rejuvenation of ancient basement-controlled fractures during further Gondwanan break-up which led to the separation of India (with eastern Gondwana) from Afro-Arabia. These basins exhibit considerably thicker and rapidly varying stratigraphic sequences which reflect successive phases of rifting, subsidence and depositional settings in time, with the type and provenance of basin-fill helping to detail the developing palaeogeography for each stage. The precise relationships of these varied intra-and inter-basin facies are not yet properly understood.The discovery of commercial oil and gas in several of these Mesozoic rift basins accelerated competitive exploration activity by a host of operating companies leading to the proliferation of informal locally-applicable in-house subsurface lithostratigraphic nomenclature schemes. These, in the extreme cases, either ignore published surface nomenclature, or else utilize existing surface-defined formation names which then become over-loaded with undifferentiated coeval but depositionally and environmentally different units without due regard to internationally accepted rules. This confusion is further compounded by detailed local academic research from within and outside Yemen, with little or no access to subsurface data, and by service companies utilizing limited client-supplied data which is then extrapolated on a province-wide or a regional basis; proliferation takes place th rough data exchange between operators or through circulation of nonexclusive reports, or by means of localized publications.A Stratigraphic Commission was appointed to address this problem and to carry out nomenclature clean-up and simplification. After intensive review of all utilised nomenclature and with full cooperation from the operating companies, its principal findings are summarised in graphic form (in Figure 4 and Figure 5) which include, for example: retention but revision; correction and expansion of the formalised nomenclature in Beydoun and Greenwood (1968) which will apply to all of Yemen; one new formation, previously unrecognised until recent subsurface and outcrop studies (the Saar Formation) has been added; formalisation of several new members in the Madbi Formation (previously informally assigned formation rank); a new member to the Oishn formation, the Sa'af Member (previously informally called the Furt formation); correction to and reassignment of the Nayfa Formation type section to the Ma'abir Member of the Madbi Formation, the type Nayfa provisionally, now being at Mintaq salt dome. Full descriptions of these and of all the revised Mesozoic nomenclature together with that for the Palaeozoic and Cenozoic will be published later in International Lexicon of Stratigraphy format.

Partial desalination of sea water can be achieved in microbial desalination cells using the potential difference between the anode and cathode as a driving force. More interestingly, the microbial electrosynthesis cell is capable of producing organic acids, alcohols, methane, and bioplastics using CO2(a major greenhouse gas) as sole carbon feedstock. However, these technologies are still in the growing phase-mostly validated in lab-scale studies and, thus, yet to find position among field-scale prototypes. The fabrication details, main output, and various glitches during the bioconversion, where there is scope for further development, are outlined systematically.

Based on the attributes of the oil inclusion assemblages (fluorescence colour of the oil, bubble size, presence of bitumen), the presence of a palaeo-oil column is inferred prior to migration of gas into the reservoir. When a palaeo-oil column is displaced by gas, a residual volume fraction of oil remains in pores. If the gas does not completely mix with the oil, molecular partitioning between the residual oil and the new gas charge may change the composition and properties of the residual oil (gas stripping or gas washing). To simulate this phenomenon in the laboratory, we sealed small amounts of crude oil (42 and 30 similar to API) and excess pure gas (methane, ethane, or propane) in fused silica capillary capsules (FSCCs), with and without water. These mixtures were characterized with the same methods used to characterize the fluid inclusions, heating and cooling stage microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, synchrotron FT-IR, and Raman spectroscopy. At room temperature, mixtures of ethane and propane with the 30 degrees API oil formed a new immiscible fluorescent liquid phase with colour that is visually more blue than the initial oil. The fluorescence of the original oil phase shifted to yellow or disappeared with formation of semi-solid residues. The blue-shift of the fluorescence of the immiscible phases and strong CH stretching bands in FT-IR spectra are consistent with stripping of hydrocarbon molecules from the oil. In experiments in FSCCs with water solid residues are common. At elevated temperature, reproducing geologic reservoir conditions, the fluorescence changes and therefore the molecular fractionation are enhanced. However, the precipitation of solid residues is responsible of more complex changes. Mixing experiments with the 42 degrees Lambda PI oil do not form a new immiscible hydrocarbon liquid although the fluorescence displays a similar yellow shift when gas is added. Solid residues rarely form in mixtures with 42 degrees API oil. FT-IR spectra suggest that the decrease of fluorescence intensity of the original oil at short wavelengths to be due to the partitioning of low molecular weight aromatic molecules into the vapour phase and/or the new immiscible liquid phase. The decrease of fluorescence intensity at long wavelengths appears to be due to loss of high molecular weight aromatics during precipitation of solid residues by desorption of aromatics and resins from asphaltenes. Desorption of low molecular weight aromatics and resins from asphaltenes during precipitation can also increase the fluorescence intensity at short wavelengths of the residual oil. Water clearly affects the precipitation of semi-solid residues from the oil phase of the lowest API gravity oil. The change of hydrocarbon phase(s) in UV-visible fluorescence and FT-IR enclosed within the FSCCs were compared with the fluorescence patterns of natural fluid inclusions at Phuong Dong gas condensate field. The experimental results support the concept of gas-washing of residual oil and are consistent with the oil inclusion attributes from the current gas zone at Phuong Dong field. The hydrocarbon charge history of the fractured granite reservoir is interpreted to result from the trapping of residual oil after drainage of a palaeo-oil column by gas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J,,,,,,,,,José Manuel de Araújo Baptista Mendonça,,INESC TEC - INESC Technology and Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2015,2015,"INESC TEC proposes the concept, for 2015-2020, of a large network of 12 Research Centres and Laboratories, in the region North of Portugal, involving the three public Universities and the largest Polytechnic Institute.The INESC TEC grid will be operated by INESC Porto, a private non-profit association devoted to Science and Technology, whose major associate is the University of Porto. The existence of a strong management structure defining acollective strategy is the main distinctive characteristic that sets INESC TEC apart from a loosely connected condominium of research groups.The areas of activity of INESC TEC are centred on the general Electrical Engineering and Computer (EEC) Sciences, but extended, from one side, to terrain covered by Applied Physics and from the other side to what is known as Industrial Engineering and Management as well as Innovation.Presently, one counts about 760 people working in INESC TEC, among which 240 holding a PhD degree, with several distinct levels of commitment. The twelve research Centres and Laboratories are mapped in 4 Research Clusters: Power and Energy, Communications and Devices, Industry and Innovation, Computer Science. Each cluster has some nuclear Research Groups (RG) and involves also other associate Groups, generating effective cross-border fertilization.The Strategic Vision of INESC TEC for the period 2015-2020 is aligned under the motto of THE CHALLENGE OF PERVASIVE INTELLIGENCE (systems and technologies). This challenge derives from a vision of the evolution of technology and its interaction with the society. It unites all Centres and Laboratories at INESC TEC, each contributing with the expertise of its researchers to a global response to such challenge.The PERVASIVE INTELLIGENCE will be present in the citizens’ life in the areas of power/energy, communications or industry and services (such as health or public administration). It will be characterized by distributed control, autonomous systems, distributed sensing and massive data flows. It will demand distributed information retrieval and knowledge extraction within nested loops of control. It will require complex assessments of environments, prediction, security, high-assurance systems and reliable responses.INESC TEC is in a unique position to provide comprehensive answers to this comprehensive challenge. Not only because it covers virtually all the knowledge and technologic areas required but because its management and operation model implements the concept of the knowledge-to-value production chain, leading the research activity from knowledge generation to its valorisation through a mix of processes of technology transfer. In this respect, the unique expertise at INESC TEC on Innovation processes, materialised in its Research Group CITE, is a valuable asset.The response of INESC TEC to THE CHALLENGE OF PERVASIVE INTELLIGENCE (systems and technologies) will extend to new hardware development, both in the areas of sensing and of robotics. This will constitute key pieces in the development of the roadmap of INESC TEC to contribute to exploring a new frontier: the deep sea. INESC TEC is partnering with companies in the Oil and Gas business as well as with the Armed Forces and aims at being an important contributor to the development of viable industrial solutions to meet the challenge represented by am EEZ which is the 10th of the world in size. The conditions in the deep sea are particularly hostile to humans and their technology and this motivates innovative advancement in all areas touched by INESC TEC.The general roadmap of INESC TEC, in the pursuit of excellence in science with social relevance, favours a permanent matching and partnership with the Portuguese industry, in line with the historic stance of the Unit. The strategic plan of INESC TEC is in tune with the Smart Specialization Strategy of the Region North of Portugal and covers all main vectors of such Strategy, defined by the regional administration CCDRN. The fact that INESC TEC is a regional player and not restricted to a single university is relevant, in this context.To achieve the goals defined, INESC TEC proposes the reinforcement in some of its advanced laboratory facilities and the creation of new laboratories. The facilities to be reinforced relate mainly to the clean room (nanotechnologies ad micro-fabrication), to the smart grid and electric vehicles lab, to deep sea robotics, to optical communications. The new laboratories will be in biomedical research, virtual reality and cyber-security.Finally, INESC TEC also defines the reinforcement of internationalization as another strategic vector within the same policy. In the European stage, the objective is to grow in the importance of participation up to the double of 2012 numbers, no matter how this participation is measured. But there is also the big challenge to be met, of the development of the partner institution INESC P&D Brasil managing the INESC Brasil network in association with the major Brazilian universities – the single case where a Portuguese R&D Unit develops a presence in the R&D landscape of another country. INESC TEC will be a key international player in Portuguese science and technology.This plan could not have been devised without solid foundations. During the last decade, INESC TEC more than doubled its size without compromising the excellence of its research.

The present paper presents an analysis of the options available to shipowners taking into consideration the value of deferring the investment decision vis-a-vis the advantages obtainable from the exploitation of fuel price differentials. The model shows that there is a trade-off between low LNG prices and LNG capital expenses. While in most cases it would not be recommended to invest in LNG as early as today, the model shows that investment in LNG can make economic sense as early as 2015.

To address this issue, several propane cycle enhancement approaches are investigated in this study, which require minimal modification of the existing plant configuration. These approaches rely on the use of gas turbine waste heat powered water/lithium bromide absorption cooling to either (i) subcool propane after the propane cycle condenser, or (ii) reduce propane cycle condensing pressure through pre-cooling of condenser cooling water. In the second approach, two alternative methods of pre-cooling condenser cooling water are considered, which consist of an open sea water loop, and a closed fresh water loop. In addition for all cases, three candidate absorption chiller configurations are evaluated, namely single-effect, double-effect, and cascaded double- and single-effect chillers. The thermodynamic performance of each propane cycle enhancement scheme, integrated in an actual LNG plant in the Persian Gulf, is evaluated using actual plant operating data. Subcooling propane after the propane cycle condenser is found to improve propane cycle total coefficient of performance (COPT) and cooling capacity by 13% and 23%, respectively. The necessary cooling load could be provided by either a single-effect, double-effect or cascaded and single- and double-effect absorption refrigeration cycle recovering waste heat from a single gas turbine operated at full load. Reducing propane condensing pressure using a closed fresh water condenser cooling loop is found result in propane cycle COPT and cooling capacity enhancements of 63% and 22%, respectively, but would require substantially higher capital investment than for propane subcooling, due to higher cooling load and thus higher waste heat requirements. Considering the present trend of short process enhancement payback periods in the natural gas industry, subcooling propane after the propane cycle condenser is recommended as the preferred option to boost propane cycle performance.

The chosen reservoir is a 300-m thick, laterally extensive, shallow marine formation of late Triassic-mid Jurassic age, located below Longyearbyen in Svalbard. The reservoir consists of 300 m of alternating sandstone and shale and is sealed by 400 m of shale. Experimental and numerical studies have been performed to evaluate CO2 storage capacity. A total of 51 samples of core material from one well (Dh4) were collected and tested to find the potential units for CO2 injection. Analysis of the results shows that the permeability is generally less than 2 millidarcies and the capillary entry pressure is high. This poses a serious challenge with respect to achieving practical levels of injectivity and injection pressure. For further investigation, two 32-cm-long sandstone samples from the depth 675 m (Sample 1) and 679 m (Sample 2) were selected for laboratory core flooding experiments at reservoir conditions. This review presents the experimental protocol and detailed CO2-brine drainage and imbibition relative permeability data for these two different samples of rock. Capillary pressure measurements and simulation of the transient process was used to support the interpolation of the experimental flooding data. Initial x-ray computed tomography scan showed no sign of fractures inside the cores, whereas after the core flooding experiment, there were visible fractures especially in Sample 1. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed a high proportion of diagenetic iron-minerals in the sandstones like Fe-chlorite, Fe-carbonate (FeCO3), and pyrite (FeS2). A brownish output flow was seen in the sample with highest porosity and permeability.

According to experts, until 2025 the main source of production will be waters of the Barents and Pechora Seas. The unexplored potential of hydrocarbons in the Arctic zone, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources of Russia, is 91% on the shelf and 53% on land. While almost 350 oil and gas deposits were discovered in the continental zone of the Russian Arctic, about thirty are on the Arctic shelf. The rapid growth in the production and consumption of natural gas makes it urgent to develop technologies for the storage and transportation of natural gas in large volumes, as well as the disposal of products of its use (mainly carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas). Storage and transportation of natural gas in the form of gas hydrates is considered as a promising alternative to the liquefaction or compression technologies currently used for these purposes. In terms of the efficiency of natural gas concentration (the number of gas molecules per unit volume), the hydrate formation process is less than four times inferior to its liquefaction and is comparable to compression at pressures above 10 MPa. However, the liquefaction of natural gas, its delivery to the consumer and storage in a liquid state at a temperature of minus 160 °C require significant energy and operating costs, and environmental problems and risks associated with the use of large vessels operated at high pressures become a significant drawback. The relevance of the development of alternative methods of transportation and storage of natural gas in the form of hydrates is confirmed in [Veluswamy et. al .., 2018; Rehder et. al .. 2012; Falenty et al., 2014]. However, the development of gas hydrate technologies is hindered by technological problems associated with the low rate and degree of conversion of water to hydrate [Ribeiro et al., 2008]. Recently, it has been shown that aqueous microdroplet systems stabilized by hydrophobic nanoparticles, known as dry water, increase the gas hydrate formation rate compared to bulk water or ground ice [Wang et al., 2008; Carter et. al., 2010]. The increase in hydrate formation rate is explained by the high specific surface in dry water compared to bulk water. It was shown in [Podenko et al., 2011] that increase in the content of a hydrophobic stabilizer leads to decrease in the size of droplets in dry water, which can affect the kinetics of hydrate formation. Studies aimed at determining the effect of the content of a hydrophobic stabilizer on the kinetics of CO2 hydrate formation were carried out in [Farhang et al., 2014]. However, the authors used a narrow range of changes in the content of hydrophobic stabilizer (1-6 wt.%), Which made it difficult to assess the effect of the content of hydrophobic stabilizer on the kinetics of hydrate formation. In addition, similar studies have not been conducted using natural gas as a hydrate forming gas, which is relevant for industrial technologies for transporting and storing natural gas in hydrated form. Farhang et al. using two types of hydrophobic stabilizers as an example, they showed that the degree of hydrophobicity of the stabilizer affects the kinetics of the formation of CO2 hydrates from aqueous microdrop systems. It is also known that hydrophobic silicon dioxide of the Aerosil R202, R905, R812, R972, and HDK H18 grades can be used to obtain aqueous microdroplet systems [Binks et. al .. 2006, 2010; Forny et al., 2009, 2011; Podenko et al., 2011] and others [Schutte et al., Patent USA, 1968; Allan Barry D. Patent USA 4008170, 1977] with varying degrees of hydrophobicity. Over the years, manufacturers of hydrophobized silicon dioxide become more and more, and as a result, its cost decreases. Despite all the advantages of stabilized water droplet systems, it became obvious that the system is not stable in cycles of freezing / thawing and the formation/decomposition of gas hydrates. Scientists began to attempt to stabilize water microdroplet systems. So in 2010 (Carter et al, 2010) used a gelling polymer polysaccharide to prepare dry gel. The authors showed that dry gel is more stable in cycles of gas hydrate formation/decomposition than dry water, but the disadvantages of this method are the cost of the polysaccharide (high consumption, more than 20 wt%) and the complexity of the dry gel preparation procedure due to the large the viscosity of the polysaccharide solution. Later in 2014 (Fan et al., 2014), it was proposed to use dry water prepared with the addition of SDS surfactant. It was shown that the addition of SDS leads to increase in a hydrate formation rate in dry water. In (Melnikov et al., 2019), it was shown that in a disperse system prepared on the basis of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), the methane hydrate formation rate of increases compared to ground ice. In addition, the 2016 patent (Molokitin, 2016) showed that a disperse system prepared from a frozen PVA solution and hydrophobized silica is more stable in freezing/thawing cycles compared to dry water. In addition, Yang et al. (Yang, 2019) managed to obtain the gelatinius dry solution (GDS) system, which does not separate after 10 cycles of formation / decomposition of gas hydrates. But the system is also prepared using a polysaccharide and with the addition of SDS. From the foregoing, it can be concluded that the question of finding ways to make more stable in the cycles of freezing/thawing and the formation/decomposition of gas hydrates of aqueous microdroplet systems stabilized by hydrophobized nanosilica is relevant. It is important to study the kinetics of hydrate formation in a disperse system prepared from a frozen PVA solution and hydrophobized nanosilica. In addition, at the moment, the question of the influence of the properties, brand and manufacturer of the widespread cheap environmentally friendly PVA polymer on the kinetics of hydrate formation has not been studied. Since water microdroplet systems are promising for use in gas hydrate technologies for transporting and storing natural gas, it is necessary to clearly understand what properties PVA is suitable for producing dispersed systems, which will be used in the future for the formation of natural gas hydrates.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,20-79-00285,,,,,,,,"Kazan (Volga region) Federal University, Kazan University, KFU","Kazan (Volga region) Federal University, Kazan University, KFU",,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15290029,,

Analyses of these samples included geochemical measurements, SEM (scanning electron microscope) observations, low pressure CO2 and N-2 adsorption, and high-pressure mercury injection experiments.

However, the best candidate to pursue is difficult to select and it is imperative that major investments are correctly targeted to deliver environmentally friendly, economical and reliable solutions. To conceive and assess gas turbine engines with minimum environmental impact and lowest cost of ownership in a variety of emission legislation scenarios and emissions taxation policies, a tool based on a techno-economic and environmental risk assessment methodology is required. A tool based on this approach has been developed by the authors. The core of the tool is a detailed and rigorous thermodynamic representation of power plants, around which other modules can be coupled (that model different disciplines such as aircraft performance, economics, emissions, noise, weight and cost) resulting in a multidisciplinary framework. This approach can be used for efficient and cost-effective design space exploration in the civil aviation, power generation, marine, and oil and gas fields. In the present work, a conceptual intercooled core aeroengine design was assessed with component technologies consistent with 2020 entry into service via a multidisciplinary optimisation approach. Such an approach is necessary to assess the trade-off between asset life, operating costs and technical specification. This paper examines the influence of fuel consumption, engine weight and direct operating costs with respect to extending the engine life. The principal modes of failure such as creep, fatigue and oxidation, are considered in the engine life estimation. Multidisciplinary optimisation, comprising the main engine design parameters, was carried out with maximum time between overhaul as the objective function. The trade-off between minimum block fuel burn and maximum engine life was examined; the results were compared against the initial engine design and an assessment was made to identify the design changes required for obtaining an improved engine design in terms of direct operating costs. The results obtained from the study demonstrate that an engine optimised for maximum time between overhaul requires a lower overall pressure ratio and specific thrust but this comes at the cost of lower thermal efficiency and higher engine production costs.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,0,13,,,0954-4100,2041-3025,,,,,,,,,,"Cranfield Univ, Dept Power & Prop, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, EnglandRolls Royce PLC, Bristol, Avon, England",,,,2014-12-03,WOS:000344149900004,,

The data showed that: 1) in the seventies, the total area of tropical forests of the world stood at about 1,628 x 10(6) hectares, of which about 58% or 1,043.90 x 10(6) hectares was contributed by tropical closed moist forests, and the remaining 42 % by savanna-type dry forests. 2) Of the ca. 1,043.90 x 10(6) hectares of tropical closed moist forests, about 53.8% are located in Central and South America, 28% in Asia and Oceania, and 18.2% in Africa. 3) Total storage of organic carbon (approximately equal to 50% of organic matter) amounted to 393.50 x 10(9) tonnes, with vegetation accounting for 58%, soil 41%, and litter 1%. Approximately 50% of the total storage was contributed by tropical moist and rain forests. 4) Total litter, production tropical forests was estimated at about 6.15 x 10(9) tonnes (Carbon), of which about 53% of was produced by tropical dry and moist rain forests, with the tropical moist rain forests accounted for about 30%. Turnover time of litter in tropical forests was less than 1.0 year. 5) The rates of gross primary production in tropical forests ranged from 9.5 tonnes (Carbon)/ha/year in subtropical dry forests to 100 tonnes (Carbon)/ha/year in tropical moist rain forests; and that of net production from 5.5 tonnes (Carbon)/ha/year (Subtropical dry forests) to 36.0 tonnes (Carbon)/ha/year (lowland tropical moist forests)In conclusion, it may be restated that based on rather limited available data, tropical forests, particularly the undisturbed moist and rain forests, play an important role as carbon sinks in the global carbon cycle. These forests store about 46% of the world's living terrestrial carbon pool and about 11.55% of the world's soil carbon pool. Thus, any form of destruction (burning) or reduction in area of these forests will lead to a substantial increase of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Notwithstanding this, it should be stressed that more accurate and up to date studies, using remote-sensing techniques and ground surveys to establish the actual area of the remaining tropical forests and at the rate of which these forests are being eliminated annually are urgently needed.

The nation is a hierarchical system as it consists multiple classes of decisionmakers and stakeholders ranging from national policymakers to operators of specific critical infrastructure subsystems. Critical infrastructures (e.g., transportation, telecommunications, power, banking, etc.) are highly complex and interconnected. These interconnections take the form of flows of information, shared security, and physical flows of commodities, among others. In recent years, economic and infrastructure sectors have become increasingly dependent on networked information systems for efficient operations and timely delivery of products and services. In order to ensure the stability, sustainability, and operability of our critical economic and infrastructure sectors, it is imperative to understand their inherent physical and economic linkages, in addition to their cyber interdependencies. An interdependency model based on a transformation of the Leontief input-output (I-O) model can be used for modeling: (1) the steady-state economic effects triggered by a consumption shift in a given sector (or set of sectors); and (2) the resulting ripple effects to other sectors. The inoperability metric is calculated for each sector; this is achieved by converting the economic impact (typically in monetary units) into a percentage value relative to the size of the sector. Disruptive events such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and large-scale accidents have historically shown cascading effects on both consumption and production. Hence, a dynamic model extension is necessary to demonstrate the interplay between combined demand and supply effects. The result is a foundational framework for modeling cybersecurity scenarios for the oil and gas sector.

Here we use a spatially representative network of 874 forest plots in New Zealand to examine whether commonly hypothesised drivers of forest biomass and biomass change (diversity, disturbance, nutrients and climate) differ between old-growth and secondary forests at a national scale. We calculate biomass stocks and net biomass change for live above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, deadwood and litter pools. We combine these data with plot-level information on forest type, tree diversity, plant functional traits, climate and disturbance history, and use structural equation models to identify the major drivers of biomass change. Over the period 2002-2014, secondary forest biomass increased by 2.78 (1.68-3.89) Mg ha(-1) y(-1), whereas no significant change was detected in old-growth forests (+0.28; -0.72 to 1.29 Mg ha(-1) y(-1)). The drivers of biomass and biomass change differed between secondary and old-growth forests. Plot-level biomass change of old-growth forest was driven by recent disturbance (large tree mortality within the last decade), whereas biomass change of secondary forest was determined by current biomass and past anthropogenic disturbance. Climate indirectly affected biomass change through its relationship with past anthropogenic disturbance. Our results highlight the importance of disturbance and disturbance history in determining broad-scale patterns of forest biomass change and suggest that explicitly modelling processes driving biomass change within secondary and old-growth forests is essential for predicting future changes in global forest biomass.",,,,,,,,,33,2,0,0,25,0,34,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,,,,,,,"Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New ZealandLandcare Res, Private Bag 3127, Hamilton 3240, New ZealandMinist Environm, 23 Kate Sheppard Pl, Wellington 11040, New ZealandUniv Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Forest Ecol & Conservat Grp, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England",Minist Environm,,,2017-09-01,WOS:000407846100007,,

This area was established in 1998 for the utilization of south Pars field oil and gas resources. This field is one of the largest gas resources in the world and contains about 6% of the total fossil fuels known. Petrochemical industries, gas refineries and downstream industries are being constructed in this area. At present there are three gas refineries in operation and five more gas refineries are under construction. In this study, different types of solid waste including municipal solid waste (MSW) and industrial wastes were investigated separately. The aim of the study was to focus on the management of the industrial wastes in order to minimize the environmental impact. In the first stage, the types and amounts of industrial waste in PSEEZ were evaluated by an inventory. The main types of industrial waste are oil products (fuel oil, light oil, lubricating oil), spent catalysts, adsorbents, resins, coke, wax and packaging materials. The waste management of PSEEZ is quite complex because of the different types of industry and the diversity of industrial residues. In some cases recycling/reuse of waste is the best option, but treatment and disposal are also necessary tools. Recently a design has been prepared for a disposal site in PSEEZ for the industrial waste that cannot be reused or recycled. The total surface area of this disposal site where the industrial waste should be tipped 2 for the next 20 years was estimated to be about 42 000 m(2).",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,4,0,9,,,0734-242X,,,,,,,,,,,"Chem & Chem Engn Res Ctr Iran, Tehran, IranAmir Kabir Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tehran, IranJahesh Kimia Co, Tehran, Iran",Chem & Chem Engn Res Ctr IranJahesh Kimia Co,,,2006-06-01,WOS:000238425700012,16784172,

Permafrost thaw is temporally dynamic and spatially heterogeneous because, in addition to the thickening of the active layer, localized thermokarst features form when ice-rich permafrost thaws and the ground subsides. Thermokarst produces a diversity of landforms and alters the physical environment in dynamic ways. To estimate potential changes to the carbon cycle it is imperative to quantify the size and distribution of thermokarst landforms. By performing a supervised classification on a high resolution IKONOS image, we detected and mapped small, irregular thermokarst features occurring within an upland watershed in discontinuous permafrost of Interior Alaska. We found that 12% of the Eight Mile Lake (EML) watershed has undergone thermokarst, predominantly in valleys where tussock tundra resides. About 35% of the 3.7 km(2) tussock tundra class has likely transitioned to thermokarst. These landscape level changes created by permafrost thaw at EML have important implications for ecosystem carbon cycling because thermokarst features are forming in carbon-rich areas and are altering the hydrology in ways that increase seasonal thawing of the soil.",,,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,11,0,37,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USAUniv Fairbanks, Inst Geophys, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA",,,,2013-11-07,WOS:000325247100061,,

Feasibility is examined in the context of science mission profiles of particular significance in coastal oceanography that require a modern, capable, general-purpose coastal research vessel. These missions translate into the primary Zero-V vessel requirements against which technical feasibility is assessed. Hull form analysis indicated a trimaran design enables a vessel that can meet all of the space and volume requirements as well as for fitment of the machinery, service, and control spaces necessary for operation of the vessel. To meet speed and range (endurance) requirements, the vessel needs to be constructed of aluminum to reduce weight. The beam (56 feet), length (170 feet) and draft (12 feet) of the vessel enable it to dock at all primary ports of call. With 1800 kW of installed proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel-cell power for primary propulsion, the cruising speed is 10 knots. With 10,900 kg of consumable LH2 stored in two LH2 tanks, the range of the vessel is 2400 nautical miles, with an endurance of 15 days. Both the greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria pollutant (NOx, HC, PM10) emissions were estimated based on a complete well-to-waves (WTW) analysis. Using renewable hydrogen, the annual WTW GHG emissions predicted for the Zero-V are 91.4% less than those from an equivalent vessel running on conventional diesel fuel. Analysis of the WTW criteria pollutant emissions show that hydrogen PEM fuel-cell technology can reduce these emissions below stringent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 4 marine diesel engine emissions limits regardless of whether the hydrogen is made using natural gas or renewable methods.The capital construction cost is estimated to be similar to $79 M, not unreasonable when compared to other modern diesel-fueled research vessels of similar size and capabilities. The operations and maintenance (O&M) costs of the Zero-V were estimated to be 7.7% higher than operating the equivalent diesel-fueled vessel at the assumed fuel prices for LH2 made from steam reforming of fossil natural gas. The approach to safety for the Zero-V is described in terms of the arrangement of hazardous areas on the vessel. Regulatory review of the vessel design by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) and the Class society DNV GL found no fundamental or show-stopping design concerns that would prevent eventual deployment of the Zero-V. Overall, this study found it feasible from technical, regulatory, and economic perspectives to design, build and operate a coastal research vessel powered solely by hydrogen fuel cells.

Yields of organic aerosol particles and emission factors for other atmospheric pollutants were derived for the sources from the spill, recovery, and cleanup efforts. Evaporation and subsequent secondary chemistry produced organic particulate matter with a mass yield of 8 +/- 4% of the oil mixture reaching the water surface. Approximately 4% by mass of oil burned on the surface was emitted as soot particles. These yields can be used to estimate the effects on air quality for similar events as well as for this spill at other times without these data. Whereas emission of soot from burning surface oil was large during the episodic burns, the mass flux of secondary organic aerosol to the atmosphere was substantially larger overall.

Harnessing coal, oil and gas, the energy resources contained in the store of our spaceship, Earth, has prompted a dramatic expansion in energy use and a substantial improvement in the quality of life of billions of individuals in some regions of the world. Powering our civilization with fossil fuels has been very convenient, but now we know that it entails severe consequences. We treat fossil fuels as a resource that anyone anywhere can extract and use in any fashion, and Earth's atmosphere, soil and oceans as a dump for their waste products, including more than 30 Gt/y of carbon dioxide. At present, environmental legacy rather than consistence of exploitable reserves, is the most dramatic problem posed by the relentless increase of fossil fuel global demand. Harmful effects on the environment and human health, usually not incorporated into the pricing of fossil fuels, include immediate and short-term impacts related to their discovery, extraction, transportation, distribution, and burning as well as climate change that are spread over time to future generations or over space to the entire planet. In this essay, several aspects of the fossil fuel legacy are discussed, such as alteration of the carbon cycle, carbon dioxide rise and its measurement, greenhouse effect, anthropogenic climate change, air pollution and human health, geoengineering proposals, land and water degradation, economic problems, indirect effects on the society, and the urgent need of regulatory efforts and related actions to promote a gradual transition out of the fossil fuel era.

This article presents a feedback control system for the automatic approach of the BOP to the wellhead. Compared to state-of-the-art controls, ours does not require ancillary thrusters installed alongside the riser nor inclination sensors atop of the drilling riser. Additionally, our proposed control embeds a closed-loop dynamic positioning system, thus retaining the characteristics of the original control system and adding an extra closed-loop. This eases implementation of the BOP approach control to an existing platform. To calculate the optimal gains for the BOP controller, we assume a linear system for the riser, including only the pendulum-shape. The simulation is carried out using nonlinear models for both riser and floating platform. We assume an International Towing Tank Conference standard semi-submersible platform, coupled with a 3000-m free-hanging vertical riser for the time-domain simulation.

Historically, sand-control completion decisions have often been based on the assumption that sand control will occur and have been constrained by the restrictions imposed upon sand entering the gas transport pipeline. The inherent conservatism of this approach leads to significant increases in completion costs and misses potential productivity gains.A holistic sand management strategy has been developed for the southern North Sea to challenge the conservative paradigm. This is based on a complete understanding of SNS reservoir rock properties and sand control completion performance in gas wells and has been tuned by leamings from SNS and analogous fields. It combines sand failure prediction, methodical and structured selection of sand control approach (including consideration of production performance, longevity, and risks), and novel solids lifting and erosion assessment models to achieve better quantification of the risk and consequences of sand production for wells and facilities. Key selection criteria are used instead of arbitrary decisions based on limited and often unaudited data. The role of an asset focal point with clear ownership of all relevant sand production data and issues is fundamental to the success of this integrated strategy.Tools are available to predict when, where, and even how much sand will be produced, how much sand will be lifted to surface, and how much erosion it will cause. Methodologies are also available to evaluate and rank the available sand-control techniques in a consistent and systematic manner.This systematic and integrated approach to sand management has enhanced well productivity and reduced completion costs without compromising sand management or exceeding sand production constraints.

The present study examined the influence of rain-induced turbulence on oil droplet size and dispersion of oil spills in Douglas Channel in British Columbia, Canada using hourly atmospheric data in 2011-2013. We examined three types of oils: a light oil (Cold Lake Diluent - CLD), and two heavy oils (Cold Lake Blend - CLB and Access Western Blend - AWB). We found that the turbulent energy dissipation rate produced by rainfalls is comparable to what is produced by wind-induced wave breaking in our study area. With the use of chemical dispersants, our results indicate that a heavy rainfall (rain rate >20 mm h(-1)) can produce the maximum droplet size of 300 pm for light oil and 1000 pm for heavy oils, and it can disperse the light oil with fraction of 22-45% and the heavy oils of 8-13%, respectively. Heavy rainfalls could be a factor for the fate of oil spills in Douglas Channel, especially for a spill of light oil and the use of chemical dispersants.

Like these approaches, the main waterfowl conservation targeting tool in the United States Prairie Pothole Region (US PPR) is based primarily on long-term averaged distributions of breeding pairs. While this tool has supported valuable conservation, it does not explicitly consider spatiotemporal changes in spring wetland availability and does not assess wetland availability during the brood rearing period. We sought to develop a modeling approach and targeting tool that incorporated these types of dynamics for breeding waterfowl pairs and broods. This goal also presented an opportunity for us to compare predictions from a traditional targeting tool based on long-term averages to predictions from spatiotemporal models. Such a comparison facilitated tests of the underlying assumption that this traditional targeting tool could provide an effective surrogate measure for conservation objectives such as brood abundance and climate refugia. Location: US PPR Methods: We developed spatiotemporal models of waterfowl pair and brood abundance within the PPR of the US. We compared the distributions predicted by these models and assessed similarity with the averaged pair data that is used to develop the current waterfowl targeting tool. Results: Results demonstrated low similarity and correlation between the averaged pair data and spatiotemporal brood and pair models. The spatiotemporal pair model distributions served as better surrogates for brood abundance than the averaged pair data. Main conclusions: Our study underscored the contributions that the current targeting tool has made to waterfowl conservation but also suggested that conservation plans in the region would benefit from the consideration of inter- and intra-annual dynamics. We suggested that using only the averaged pair data and derived products might result in the omission of 46-98% of important pair and brood habitat, respectively, from conservation plans.

This problem can be solved by sensing and modeling uncertain spatial behaviors, defining topological rules, and using inference and learning capabilities in a spatial reasoning system. Reasoning, which is the main component of such complex systems, requires that proper rules be defined through expert judgments in the knowledge-based part. Use of genetic fuzzy capabilities enables the algorithm to learn and be tuned to proper rules in a flexible manner and increases the preciseness and robustness of operations. The main objective of this paper was to design and evaluate a spatial genetic fuzzy system, with the goal of assessing environmental risks of air pollution due to oil well fires during the Persian Gulf War. Dynamic areas were extracted and monitored through images from NOAA, and the data were stored in an efficient spatial database. Initial spatial knowledge was determined by expert consideration of the application characteristics, and the inference engine was performed with genetic learning (GL) algorithms.

In order to offer a combination of compressible and resilient materials that form a strong sealing performance in the cryogenic environment (-196 degrees C), a new type of seal was devised by laminating muti-layers (graphite and stainless steel). The airtightness of the laminated seal was estimated by comparing contact pressure that occurs on surface of the seal with working pressure. Effects of design parameters in relation to the laminated seal were analyzed to improve sealing performance, and after that a shape of laminated seal to improve operability and airtightness was suggested.

The consequences can be dire, as evidenced by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. We present a methodology to predict major short-term changes in environmental contamination patterns, such as oil spills in the ocean and ash clouds in the atmosphere. Our approach is based on new mathematical results on the objective (frame-independent) identification of key material surfaces that drive tracer mixing in unsteady, finite-time flow data. Some of these material surfaces, known as Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), turn out to admit highly attracting cores that lead to inevitable material instabilities even under future uncertainties or unexpected perturbations to the observed flow. These LCS cores have the potential to forecast imminent shape changes in the contamination pattern, even before the instability builds up and brings large masses of water or air into motion. Exploiting this potential, the LCS-core analysis developed here provides a model-independent forecasting scheme that relies only on already observed or validated flow velocities at the time the prediction is made. We use this methodology to obtain high-precision forecasts of two major instabilities that occurred in the shape of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This is achieved using simulated surface currents preceding the prediction times and assuming that the oil behaves as a passive tracer.",,,,,,,,,112,1,0,0,26,0,133,,,0027-8424,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USAMcGill Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, CanadaMcGill Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada",,,,2012-04-18,WOS:000302164200015,22411824,

One helpful approach is the conceptualization of dissolved gases as the sum of multiple, strictly defined components. Here we decompose dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) into four components: saturation (DICsat), disequilibrium (DICdis), carbonate (DICcarb), and soft tissue (DICsoft). The cycling of dissolved oxygen is simpler, but can still be aided by considering O-2, O-2sat, and O-2dis. We explore changes in these components within a large suite of simulations with a complex coupled climate-biogeochemical model, driven by changes in astronomical parameters, ice sheets, and radiative forcing, in order to explore the potential importance of the different components to ocean carbon storage on long timescales. We find that both DICsoft and DICdis vary over a range of 40 mu mol kg(-1) in response to the climate forcing, equivalent to changes in atmospheric pCO(2) on the order of 50 ppm for each. The most extreme values occur at the coldest and intermediate climate states. We also find significant changes in O-2 disequilibrium, with large increases under cold climate states. We find that, despite the broad range of climate states represented, changes in global DICsoft can be quantitatively approximated by the product of deep ocean ideal age and the global export production flux. In contrast, global DICdis is dominantly controlled by the fraction of the ocean filled by Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). Because the AABW fraction and ideal age are inversely correlated among the simulations, DICdis and DICsoft are also inversely correlated, dampening the overall changes in DIC. This inverse correlation could be decoupled if changes in deep ocean mixing were to alter ideal age independently of AABW fraction, or if independent ecosystem changes were to alter export and remineralization, thereby modifying DICsoft. As an example of the latter, we show that iron fertilization causes both DICsoft and DICdis to increase and that the relationship between these two components depends on the climate state. We propose a simple framework to consider the global contribution of DICsoft + DICdis to ocean carbon storage as a function of the surface preformed nitrate and DICdis of dense water formation regions, the global volume fractions ventilated by these regions, and the global nitrate inventory.",,,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,4,0,28,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA, E-08193 Barcelona, SpainICREA, Pg Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, SpainMcGill Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A7, CanadaEmpa, Lab Air Pollut & Environm Technol, Uberlandstr 129, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland",,,,2018-07-06,WOS:000435652900004,,

Small-scale historical Maori fires in the forests of Te Urewera National Park, North Island, initiated forest successions that were dominated early on by Kunzea ericoides (Myrtaceae), and later by Knightia excelsa (Proteaceae) and Weinmannia racemosa (Cunoniaceae). Previous work in these forests suggested that the more recent of these successions, initiated after the arrival of deer in the late 19th century, have failed to recover to pre-fire composition and structure. This failure was attributed to browsing pressure that prevented palatable canopy tree species such as Weinmannia racemosa establishing at adequate densities. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying changes in forest structure, tree species composition and above-ground tree biomass between 1980 and 2010 using permanent forest plots in three successional communities. The three communities were dominated by (1) Kunzea ericoides-kanuka, (2) Knightia excelsa-rewarewa, and (3) Weinmannia racemosa-kamahi. We show that above-ground biomass increased in all communities between 1980 and 2010, and did so most strongly in the first two communities. However, tree species composition changed little over the same time except for a more than three-fold increase in tree fern abundance in the kanuka community where they are now co-dominant with Kunzea ericoides. Recruitment of trees of canopy species was very low (<= 0.06% per year) relative to mortality (1.1-3.9% per year) in all three communities. The proportional increase in above-ground biomass observed in the kanuka community was low relative to the large proportional increase in basal area. This occurred because of the higher abundance of tree ferns in 2010 plots that have low stem tissue density. The minimal compositional change over 30 years in these communities and paucity of recruitment of trees of canopy species point to arrested succession. Without management intervention to increase tree recruitment rates of canopy species, forest successions in this region will be characterised by high tree fern abundance, low biomass at local scales, and limited transitions to tall forest communities.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,15,0,17,,,0110-6465,1177-7788,,,,,,,,,,"Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand",,,,2014-01-01,WOS:000339134100006,,

Herein, inspired by the adhesion of marine mussels, the polydopamine (PDA) coating with hierarchical structure was directly fabricated onto the surface of melamine (MF) sponge by facile self-polymerization in dopamine solution. Then, a super hydrophobic and superoleophilic sponge was successfully obtained after the modification by dodecanethiol (DDT) at ambient temperature. The as-prepared sponge can selectively separate a series of oil droplets in oil-in water emulsion with high efficiency (transparency: 76.6-93.8%) and absorb various oils or organic solvents up to 45.2-98.6 times of its own weight. Moreover, in conjunction with a vacuum system, great amounts of oils up to 20 times its own weight can be effectively separated from water surface within 1 s by the sponge.

This is primarily due to chemical compositional complexity of both the oil residues and environmental matrices, and the lack of instrumental selectivity due to co-elution of interferences with the target analytes. To overcome these analytical selectivity issues, we used an enhanced resolution gas chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry in Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) mode (GC/MS/MS-MRM) to eliminate interferences within the ion chromatograms of target analytes found in environmental samples. This new GC/MS/MS-MRM method was developed and used for forensic fingerprinting of deep -water and marsh sediment samples containing oily residues from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The results showed that the GC/MS/MS-MRM method increases selectivity, eliminates interferences, and provides more accurate quantitation and characterization of trace levels of alkyl-PAHs and biomarker compounds, from weathered oil residues in complex sample matrices. The higher selectivity of the new method, even at low detection limits, provides greater insights on isomer and homolog compositional patterns and the extent of oil weathering under various environmental conditions. The method also provides flat chromatographic baselines for accurate and unambiguous calculation of petroleum forensic biomarker compound ratios. Thus, this GC/MS/MS-MRM method can be a reliable analytical strategy for more accurate and selective trace level analyses in petroleum forensic studies, and for tacking continuous weathering of oil residues.

The cost and benefit of such systems were evaluated through the economic assessment where the life cycle cost relative to installation, operation and recycling of the solar panels, fuel savings and payback time were considered. Research findings revealed the payback time would be around three years, whereas the accumulative fuel cost saving would be over $300,000 by the end of vessel life. The sensitivity analysis using two varying parameters - energy efficiency and investment cost - implied, that the longer payback time would be positively associated with lower energy efficiencies and higher investment costs.

While each of these parameters has oil spill signature in it, we find that combining these parameters into a new parameter, F, is a more effective way for oil slick detection. The second algorithm uses the total power of four polarimetric channels image (SPAN) to find the optimal representation of the oil spill signature. Otsu image segmentation method can then be applied to the F and SPAN images to extract the oil slick features. Using the L-band fully polarimetric Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle - synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) data acquired during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster event in the Gulf of Mexico, we are able to successfully extract the oil slick information in the contaminated ocean area.

We analyze the fuel costs and overall exploitation costs by simulating bunker planning decisions under stochastic fuel prices, presence in emission controlled areas, and route lengths. Our analyses reveal that the fuel costs of LNG-fueled vessels are often lower than those of conventional vessels, even under unfavorable LNG prices. Due to the higher initial investment costs in LNG-fueled vessels, these fuel cost reductions do not always translate into lower overall exploitation costs.

Physical models at a scale of 1:4.21 (model to prototype) and two fill levels (50% and 95%) were tested in wave and towing tank facilities in the Hydromechanics Laboratory at the United States Naval Academy. The models were towed at a range of scaled speeds to represent currents and subjected to scaled wave conditions in one of the tanks. During these tests, attachment loads were measured and dynamic response was evaluated.In addition to the physical modeling approach, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to assess steady drag measurements at the 1:4.21 scale and the results were compared to the experimental tests. The CFD modeling results were comparable to those obtained from the physical modeling tests, at least at the higher fill levels that were analyzed.The results indicated that the model response tended to follow the wave forcing more at the middle wave frequencies. For both fill levels, the response of the forward end of model increased with wave frequency while the response of the rear end of the model remained rather consistent across the frequencies tested. The results did not indicate a significant difference in dynamic response when the model was tested in both waves and current. The average attachment loads, however, were higher when the model was tested in waves and a current than in waves only. The attachment loads were also higher in wave and current conditions that included a faster current or lower-frequency (larger) waves.The intent of the project, through both modeling methods, was to increase the understanding of the loads on and the response of a floating tube in waves and currents.

In this sense, this study analyzed the dynamic of urban growth of São Vicente city, located on the central-south coast of São Paulo, between the years 1963 to 2007, with main concern for the urban expansion in the Coastal Zone. To achieve that, we used six mosaics of aerial photographs from each decade within the analyzed period, in order to r map the urban areas in a GIS environment. Data on urbanization were crossed between the subsequent decades to get the urban expansion in the analyzed period. We correlated the urban expansion cycles with regional public policies, with the aim of subsidize the comprehension of the territorial and environmental planning of coastal cities. The largest growth in urban areas (29.75%) was observed in the period 1972 to 1987, and was closely linked to the establishment of anthropic infra-structure (railways, roads, pipelines, electric transmission lines, among others) in the region, particularly the expansion of highways linking the state capital with the coastal cities (especially Santos, Cubatão, São Vicente, Guarujá). This period is coincident to the larger population growth within the studied timeline, when more than 76,000 inhabitants established in the city. The occupation of the island of São Vicente has already had quite consolidated in 1963, and the further expansion of urban centers during the analyzed period was associated with the process of slumming. Urban expansion was greater in the continental area, reaching to 200%, where roads and railways represented the main vectors of occupation. Territorial occupation was also influenced by the high valuation of terrains situated close to the beaches and the concentration of real state ventures, which were mostly reserved to serve as second residences for richer people, whereas poorer classes were induced to occupy mangroves, estuarine banks and hillside areas, most of them within protected or vulnerable areas. A strong correlation was observed between occupied are and population growth rates, showing that migration and arrival of new inhabitants were associated to loss of natural areas. However, the occupation speed seemed to be regulated by macroeconomic factors, in addition to the expansion of roads. The rates of population and urban growth during the last two periods were reduced in comparison to the initial periods; however, it must be highlighted that both population and urbanization presented a continuous growth, which was initially more intense. Another important factor that historically have exerted pressure on the natural areas of São Vicente is the seasonality, as fluctuating population reaches to more than 1,350 thousand people, which is almost equivalent to the resident population. The recent economic growth of Santos, related to oil and gas exploration in the Santos Basin and the expansion of port and industrial activities, may induce further urbanization for São Vicente, threatening mangroves and the remnants of Atlantic Forest from the local Protected Areas, as well as their nearby areas, which have the function of being buffer zones. Urban sprawl in coastal zones should attend the various planning instruments that are applied to rule territorial ordering and solve land use conflicts, considering the protection of natural environments from economic interests, as predicted by the Federal and State coastal management plans.",,"A região costeira do Estado de São Paulo passa por constante processo de expansão urbana, de forma, geralmente, não planejada, resultando na supressão de áreas naturais, principalmente os ambientes costeiros sensíveis, como manguezais, restingas e encostas. Em especial, a Região Metropolitana da Baixada Santista (RMBS), localizada no centro do litoral do Estado de São Paulo, sofre pressão urbana ligada à expansão das atividades econômicas na região. Nesse sentido, o presente trabalho analisou a dinâmica da expansão urbana do município de São Vicente, localizado na RMBS, entre os anos de 1963 a 2007, correlacionando-a com os ciclos econômicos e as políticas públicas regionais, com o objetivo de subsidiar o planejamento territorial e ambiental das cidades litorâneas. Para tanto, foram utilizados seis mosaicos de fotografias aéreas de cada década analisada, para o mapeamento das áreas urbanas em ambiente SIG. Os dados sobre a urbanização foram cruzados entre os anos para se obter a expansão urbana no período analisado. O maior crescimento das áreas urbanas (29,75%) foi observado no período de 1972 a 1987, intimamente ligado ao incremento de infraestrutura na região, em especial com a expansão das rodovias que ligam a capital do estado com a Baixada Santista. A área insular de São Vicente já se apresentava bastante consolidada em 1963, com expansão de núcleos urbanos ao longo do período analisado associado ao processo de favelização. A expansão urbana foi maior na área continental do que na área insular, tendo as estradas e ferrovia como vetores de ocupação. O crescimento econômico da Baixada Santista, relacionado à exploração de óleo e gás na Bacia de Santos e à expansão das atividades portuárias, poderá direcionar ainda mais o adensamento urbano para São Vicente, ameaçando os remanescentes de Mata Atlântica das Unidades de Conservação da região. O processo histórico de ocupação identificado indica uma tendência regional de drástica substituição da paisagem natural ainda existente em áreas limítrofes às Unidades de Conservação, por uma paisagem antrópica, que, provavelmente, será representada por ocupações irregulares sem infraestrutura urbana adequada para a sustentabilidade regional.",,,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,1,7,,,1646-8872,,,,,,,,,,,"Universidade Federal de São Carlos, BrazilUniversidade Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho” orgdiv1=, BrazilUniversidade de São Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal de São CarlosUniversidade Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho” orgdiv1=Universidade de São Paulo,,,2013-12-01,SCIELO:S1646-88722013000400011,,

To realize economic exploration and development of lacustrine shale oil, the geological regularities of accumulation and high yield of retained movable petroleum in shale should be understood first. In this work, taking the shale strata of Kong 2 Member and Sha 3 Member in the Paleogene of Huanghua depression in the Bohai Bay Basin as examples, based on the previous joint analysis results of over ten thousand core samples and the latest oil testing, production test and geochemical data of more than 30 horizontal wells, accumulation conditions and models of retained movable petroleum in lacustrine shale were studied comprehensively. The study shows that at moderate organic matter abundance (with TOC from 2% to 4%), shale strata have the best match between oil content and brittleness, and thus are rich in oil and good in fracability. Moderate ancient lake basin size and moderate sediment supply intensity are the internal factors leading to best coupling of organic matter abundance and brittle mineral content in the shale formation. Moderate thermal evolution maturity of R-o of 0.7%-1.0% (at burial depth of 3200 to 4300 m) is the interval where oil generation from thermal evolution and oil adsorption by kerogen in shale layers match best, and retained movable petroleum is high in proportion. Moderate diagenetic evolution stage (3200 to 4300 m in the middle diagenetic stage A) is conducive to the formation of a large number of dissolved pores and organic matter pores, which provide storage space for shale oil enrichment. Moderate development degree of natural fractures (without damaging the shale oil roof and floor sealing conditions) is conducive to the storage, seepage and preservation of shale oil. The research results have overthrown the general understanding that high organic matter abundance, high maturity, and high development degree of natural fractures are conducive to shale oil enrichment, and have guided the comprehensive evaluation of shale oil and gas sweet spots and well deployment in the second member of the Kongdian Formation in the Cangdong sag and the Shahejie Formation in the Qikou sag.

In addressing the mineral impact on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling, we determined microbial abundances, activities of N-hydrolyzing (aminopeptidases, protease, urease) and P-hydrolyzing (phosphatase) enzymes and the potential substrate availability as well as their physicochemical and mineralogical controls in whole soil profiles along the 120 kyr-old Franz Josef chronosequence (New Zealand). Pedogenic soil iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) resided initially (<1 kyrs) in metal-humus complexes, changed to poorly crystalline Fe and Al at intermediate-aged sites (1-12 kyrs) and into dominance of clay and crystalline Fe oxides at the oldest site. Despite this, organic C (OC) and organic N (ON) stocks increased only slightly with soil age, whereas organic P (OP) stocks decreased continuously. In organic layers, enzyme activities were mainly regulated by ON and OP concentrations, whereas in mineral soils, mineral enzyme relations were more complex and included both, direct and indirect effects. Protease, urease, and phosphatase activities were inhibited by mineral interactions, especially with poorly crystalline Fe and Al oxides, whereas aminopeptidases were less affected by mineralogical properties. On a pedon basis, most N-hydrolyzing enzyme activities per ON stocks responded negatively to increasing stocks of poorly crystalline Fe and Al minerals, but were also affected by the C:N ratio of labile organic substrates. Profile-based phosphatase activities per OP stock were highest at the oldest sites having the largest stocks of clay and crystalline Fe oxides. Overall, our study indicates that long-term mineral changes create distinct patterns of nutrient accumulation and N- and P-enzyme activities at both horizon and pedon scale, with a variable extent of the mineralogical effect for the different N-hydrolyzing enzymes.

These decreases are a concern partly because of possible negative consequences for future forest productivity. This issue is investigated by applying the G'DAY model of C and N cycling in pasture and forest ecosystems to simulate the replacement of improved, legume-rich pasture by P. radiata plantations that are grown over several harvest cycles at a site in New Zealand. We illustrate how process models can be used for analysing constraints on long-term productivity by performing a sensitivity analysis of G'DAY's response to various rates of N removal. We find that simulated productivity declines over successive forest rotations and that the rate of decline is sensitive to N losses through wood harvesting, slash removal, and N leakage (i.e. leaching and soil gaseous emission). However, even when these N losses are zero, forest productivity still declines because of a gradual depletion of labile soil N reserves. Simulations are used to evaluate the mean annual increment (MAI) in wood volume over forty 30-year forest rotations. With harvesting only, simulated MAI declines from 44 m(3) ha(-1)yr(-1) in the first rotation to 18 m; ha(-1)yr(-1) in the fortieth rotation. The simulated MAI in the fortieth rotation is 13 m(3) ha(-1)yr(-1) with harvesting and leakage, and 11 m(3) ha(-1)yr(-1) with harvesting, leakage and 50% slash removal. If the simulation with harvesting only is modified so N removed in harvests is replaced by an equivalent fertiliser addition, MAI is 28 m(3) ha(-1)yr(-1) in the fortieth rotation.

Photooxidation induced by ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun is one of the most significant processes of long-term weathering that changes the chemical nature of oil. Experimental studies on photooxidation in the natural environment are generally not practicable due to the variability of factors that are more readily controlled in a laboratory. The emission spectra and irradiance of artificial lamps are critical factors for simulating sunlight, and the process of acceleration should be differentiated from simulation. We present a comprehensive review of the exposure conditions affecting in vitro photooxidation studies, including the types of lamps, their spectra and irradiance levels and maintenance conditions. The importance of xenon arc, metal halide along with mercury-xenon, high-pressure mercury lamps and other lamps with respect to their spectral characteristics is discussed and the selection guide is provided.

However, little is known about transport dynamics of CPOM, its relation to discharge, and its annual exports from mountain streams. Much of this knowledge gap is due to sampling difficulties. In this study, CPOM was sampled over one-month snowmelt high flow seasons in two high-elevation, subalpine, streams in the Rocky Mountains. Bedload traps developed for sampling gravel bedload were found to be suitable samplers for CPOM transport. CPOM transport rates were well related to flow in consecutive samples but showed pronounced hysteresis over the diurnal fluctuations of flow, between consecutive days, and over the rising and falling limbs of the high-flow season. In order to compute annual CPOM load, hysteresis effects require intensive sampling and establishing separate rating curves for all rising and falling limbs. Hysteresis patterns of CPOM transport relations identified in the well-sampled study streams may aid with estimates of CPOM transport and export in less well-sampled Rocky Mountain streams. Transport relations for CPOM were similar among three high elevation mountain stream with mainly coniferous watersheds. Differences among streams can be qualitatively attributed to differences in CPOM contributions from litter fall, from the presence of large woody debris, its grinding into CPOM sized particles by gravel-cobble bedload transport, hillslope connectivity, drainage density, and biological consumption. CPOM loads were 3.6 and 3.2 t/yr for the two Rocky. Mountain streams. Adjusted to reflect decadal averages, values increased to 11.3 and 10.2 thin CPOM yields related to the entire watershed were 2.7 and 4 kg/ha/yr for the years studied, but both streams exported similar amounts of 6.5 and 6.6 kg/ha/yr when taking the forested portion of the watershed into account. To reflect decadal averages, CPOM yields per basin area were adjusted to 8.6 and 12.6 kg/ha/yr and to 21 kg/ha/yr for the forested watershed parts. CPOM yield may be more meaningfully characterized if annual CPOM loads are normalized by the area of a seam along the stream banks together with the stream surface area rather than by the forested or total watershed area.

Attention has been drawn to this resource as a number of locations with high tidal current velocity have recently been leased by the Crown Estate for commercial development. Although tides are periodic and predictable, there are times when the current velocity is too low for any power generation. However, it has been proposed that a portfolio of diverse sites located around the UK will deliver a firm aggregate output due to the relative phasing of the tidal signal around the coast. This paper analyses whether firm tidal power is feasible with 'first generation' tidal current generators suitable for relatively shallow water, high velocity sites. This is achieved through development of realistic scenarios of tidal current energy industry development. These scenarios incorporate constraints relating to assessment of the economically harvestable resource, tidal technology potential and the practical limits to energy extraction dictated by environmental response and spatial availability of resource. The final scenario is capable of generating 17 TWh/year with an effective installed capacity of 7.8 GW, at an average capacity factor of 29.9% from 7 major locations. However, it is concluded that there is insufficient diversity between sites suitable for first generation tidal current energy schemes for a portfolio approach to deliver firm power generation.

The assemblage includes three inscribed polygonal finger rings, four finger rings with decorated bezel (of which one bears a legend in the Samaritan script), two inscribed amulet pendants, and two thin cylindrical foils (containers of phylacteries, designated for the safekeeping of a magical or religious text written on papyri or parchment). The aim of this research is to use archeometallurgical non-destructive and destructive methods in order to determine manufacturing processes of the objects, and if possible their production place, their origin of ore and their use.The results indicate that the three polygonal rings were prestige objects made of gunmetal and manufactured by lost-wax casting followed by heat-treatment probably at the same workshop. Among the four finger rings with decorated bezel, the two with incised motifs were made of gunmetal alloy, while the one with eye-shaped bezel was made of relatively pure leaded-copper, and the other ring, with the inscribed bezel, was made of brass. These rings were manufactured by using dissimilar techniques; the two with decorated bezel by casting and then shaped by hammering and annealing cycles; the eye-shaped bezel ring by casting with no further treatment; and the inscribed bezel ring made of brass by manufacturing two different parts, hoop and bezel, that were brazed together, and then hammered and annealed.Both amulet pendants were manufactured by lost-wax casting and given their shape and composition they were probably manufactured at two different workshops. Both cylindrical foils were made of leaded-copper that was first cast into an open mold, then hammered into a thin foil and folded at a later stage, probably at the same workshop.All the examined gunmetal and brass artifacts contained 4-20 wt.% Zn, indicating that their alloys were originally manufactured by cementation, produced of recycled metal, probably due to economic considerations.

Such approaches will aim to achieve economic growth which considers local needs and values, but is also resilient due to being underpinned by the benefits of well managed/maintained natural capital. However such an approach is still being testedThe unique natural assets of the Liverpool City Region (LCR) and its opportunities for growth (i.e. a natural coastline and estuary of international conservation importance alongside large scale wind generation, high potential for tidal energy and major commercial and maritime development provides a unique and interesting testbed for the natural capital approach. Its rich natural assets and nationally renowned environmental leadership and knowledge means the city region can provide a significant contribution to the national debate on the natural capital approach.This placement hosted by Nature Connected (the govt. approved Local Nature Partnership for the LCR) to support them in their ambition to embed a natural capital approach in the Liverpool City Region. It will make recommendations for the implementation of the 25 Year Plan for the Environment at a local level by contributing to and learning from the development of a natural capital approach in LCR. Nature Connected will support the placement through its board and various member organisation. Organisation will play a lead role in support of different aspects of the project, based on their expertise. Nature Connected Membership of key environmental and business organisations and the six local councils provides a key network to support the placement.The overall method will combine existing research around the Natural Capital approach, information on relevant policies for its implementation and local knowledge and perceptions through 3 actions: Action 1: A review of existing research knowledge, policies and how they are relevant to Natural Capital Approach in the Liverpool City Region. This will draw on outputs from research programmes and initiatives around Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services, (i.e. NEA, VNN and BESS) as well as more recent projects which are now testing the implementation of the Natural Capital approach such as the NERC funded SWEEP. This information will be considered in the context of the Liverpool City Region and be used to inform the workshops and interviews as well as the case study approach. Action 2: Workshops and Interviews with key stakeholders and decision makers (i.e. planners, Combined Authority staff etc.) from the Liverpool City Region. around the natural capital approach. These are aimed at both increasing the awareness of the natural capital approach through knowledge transfer as well as gathering information on local knowledge and perceptions. Action 3: Applying a natural capital approach to development case studies, including full social cost accounting the for different decision scenarios/outcomes and Consideration policy inventions, which may impact on decisions and may provide/facilitate funding mechanisms for investment in natural capitalThis will result in a transfer of knowledge to key Liverpool City Region Stakeholders on the natural capital approach and allow an exploration of the barriers and opportunities to aligning and integrating a natural capital policy approach. It should also provide recommendation to feed into the national debate on devolution and local implementation of the 25 year for the environment.

Three sites with an average distance between 0 m (EM-1), 100 m (EM-2), and 1000 m (EM-3) of a submarine outfall-I (Guamare RN, Brazil) and another site (GA-1) with an average distance of 12000 m east of Outfall I, near the city of Galinhos, were studied. DGT units were deployed at the same sites in three campaigns from July, 2010 to June, 2011.Effects on the accuracy of analytical results regarding the deployment time, gel porosity, and thickness were evaluated. There was no difference between the measurements obtained with two sets of DGT devices, those assembled with open or restrictive pore gel, respectively, showing that organic metallic species are not present near the submarine outlet. After 21 day deployments in a region (near Submarine Outfall I) that receives produced waters that have been treated, there was evidence of biofilm formation on DGT membranes. However, it was demonstrated that the biofilm interference with DGT measurements was negligible.Data found in this work show that total concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn in seawater samples collected at sites GA-1 and EM-1 in two campaigns were below 033, 1.67, 0.47, 0.70, 2.86 ng mL(-1) respectively. For the first time, labile levels of Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn in an area under the influence of oil production were determined. DGT measurements allowed the verification of the effects of temporal variation on levels of Zn and Ni. There were no effects of spatial variations on levels of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn at the four studied sites, suggesting no contamination of these metals at the northeastern Brazilian coastal area investigated in this work.

Hot hydrothermal circulation may facilitate the degradation of otherwise un-reactive dissolved organic matter, playing an important role in the long-term global carbon cycle. The oldest, most recalcitrant forms of DOC, which make up most of oceanic DOC, can be recovered by solid-phase extraction. Here we present measurements of solid-phase extractable DOC from samples collected between 2009 and 2013 at seven vent sites in the Atlantic, Pacific and Southern oceans, along with magnesium concentrations, a conservative tracer of water circulation through hydrothermal systems. We find that magnesium and solid-phase extractable DOC concentrations are correlated, suggesting that solid-phase extractable DOC is almost entirely lost from solution through mineralization or deposition during circulation through hydrothermal vents with fluid temperatures of 212-401 degrees C. In laboratory experiments, where we heated samples to 380 degrees C for four days, we found a similar removal efficiency. We conclude that thermal degradation alone can account for the loss of solid-phase extractable DOC in natural hydrothermal systems, and that its maximum lifetime is constrained by the timescale of hydrothermal cycling, at about 40 million years(3).",,,,,,,,,84,3,0,0,36,0,92,,,1752-0894,1752-0908,,,,,,,,,,"Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Res Grp Marine Geochem, ICBM MPI Bridging Grp, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm ICBM, D-26129 Oldenburg, GermanyAlfred Wegener Inst, HGF MPG Grp Deep Sea Ecol & Technol, D-27570 Bremerhaven, GermanyUniv Georgia, Skidaway Inst Oceanog, Marine Sci, Savannah, GA 31411 USAUniv Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Oceans, Seattle, WA 98115 USANOAA PMEL, Seattle, WA 98115 USAUniv Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, EnglandGEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, D-24148 Kiel, GermanyJacobs Univ Bremen, D-28759 Bremen, GermanyUniv Toulouse, Lab Geosci Environm Toulouse, F-31400 Toulouse, FranceUniv Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, GermanyUniv Bremen, Dept Geosci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",,,,2015-11-01,WOS:000367200000019,,

An average of three to four squeeze treatments per week are performed across the online wells, creating tremendous operational, chemical, and logistical challenges. This produces the ideal environment in which to evaluate new technologies and engineering solutions in an attempt to increase the wells' overall efficiency.Deep downhole chemical injection (DDHCI) was installed on Well A26/08 and brought on line in July 2003. The Miller DDHCI is unique to the industry because it allows the injection of a scale inhibitor at the perforations by means of a tail pipe, essentially protecting the whole of the tubing from scale deposition. This approach has the potential to reduce the need for additional scale control through squeeze treatments.Much emphasis has been placed on the efficiency of scale protection that DDHCI offers. A year of flowing the well under the protection of the continuous-injection chemical has yielded much information about the nature of the chemical delivery and inhibitor efficiency. Much also has been learned about the pumping hardware required to ensure continued performance. Further information has been provided by two intensive sampling exercises that have allowed independent analysis of the squeeze chemicals and the injected chemical.This paper details the design criteria of the DDHCI completion as well as the philosophy of installing such a device.

Moreover, the work explored the effect of a prototype oil dispersant, Corexit EC9500A, on the ozonation rate. Rapid oxidation of TPHs, n-alkanes and PAHs was observed at various gaseous ozone concentrations (i.e. 86, 200 and 300 ppbv). Generally, the presence of the oil dispersant enhanced ozonation of the oil compounds. The addition of humic acid inhibited the reaction, while increasing salinity accelerated the degradation.

Many infrastructure-related material challenges have emerged as a result of the need (i) to explore offshore marine environments for wind power generation, (ii) for deeper and more complex underground wellbore systems for new oil & gas explorations, (iii) for robust containment and shielding structures for new nuclear power plants and (iv) for larger dam structures for future hydropower generation. Our vision for this proposal is to build a world leading and long lasting partnership between academics in the UK and China, integrated with industrial partners and other world leading academic groups around the world, to collectively address some of those construction material challenges with a focus on sustainability. The commonality in the assembled group is our interest and expertise in exploring potentials for magnesia-bearing construction materials in solving some of those new challenges, by either providing completely new solutions or enhanced solutions to existing material systems. This is a unique area to China and the UK where there is significant complementary expertise in the different grades of and applications for magnesia. The project consortium from the University of Cambridge, University College London, Chongqing University and Nanjing Tech University has the required interdisciplinary mix of materials, structural and geotechnical engineers, with world leading unique expertise in magnesia-based construction materials. The intention is to share and advance our global understanding of the performance of those proposed materials, road map future research and commercial needs and identify the ideal applications in our future energy infrastructures where most performance impact and sustainability benefits can be achieved.The proposed focusses two main areas of research. The first is the technical advantages and benefits that magnesia can provide to existing cement systems. This includes (i) its use as an expansive additive for large mass concrete constructions e.g. dams and nuclear installations, (ii) its role in magnesium phosphate cements for the developing of low pH cements suitable for nuclear waste applications and (iii) its role in advancing the development of alkali activated cements by providing low shrinkage and corrosion resistance. The second is the delivery of sustainable MgO production processes that focus on the use of both mineral and reject brine resources. An integral part of this project will be the knowledge transfer activities and collaboration with industry and other relevant research centres around the world. An overarching aspect of the proposed research is the mapping out of the team's capabilities and the integration of expertise and personnel exchange to ensure maximum impact. This will ensure that the research is at the forefront of the global pursuit for a sustainable future energy infrastructure and will ensure that maximum impact is achieved. The consortium plans to act as a global hub to provide a national and international platform for facilitating dialogue and collaboration to enhance the global knowledge economy.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/M003159/1,,,,,,,,University of Cambridge,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15390989,,

Two 26 year old reforestation experiments with four Eucalyptus species (E. cladocalyx var nana, E. occidentalis, E. sargentii and E. wandoo) were compared with agricultural sites (Field). SOC stores (to 0.3 m depth) ranged between 33 and 55 Mg ha(-1), with no statistically significant differences between tree species and adjacent farmland. Farming comprised crop and pasture rotations. In contrast, the reforested plots contained additional carbon in the tree biomass (23-60 Mg ha(-1)) and litter (19-34 Mg ha(-1)), with the greatest litter accumulation associated with E. sargentii. Litter represented between 29 and 56% of the biomass carbon and the protection or utilization of this litter in fire-prone, semi-arid farmland will be an important component of carbon management. Exch-Na and Exch-Mg accumulated under E. sargentii and E. occidentalis at one site.

These variations were supported by fluorescence indexes and are consistent with differences in optical molecular weight and aromaticity indicators. Fluorescence indices were consistent with autochthonous material of aquatic origin in surface waters, with more terrestrial, humified allochthonous material in deeper pore waters. CDOM optical properties were consistent with significantly enhanced microbial activity in regions closest to the oil well, along with a three-dimensional excitation/emission matrix fluorescence spectrum peak attributable to oil, suggesting anaerobic microbial degradation of oil.

However, the challenge of meeting its targets lies mainly in the intimate relationship between GHG emissions and energy production, which in turn links to industry and economic growth. The Middle East and North African region (MENA), particularly those nations rich oil and gas (O&G) resources, depend on these as a main income source. Persuading the region to cut down on O&G production or reduce its GHG emissions is hugely challenging, as it is so vital to its economic strength. In this paper, an alternative option is established by creating an economic link between GHG emissions, measured as their CO2 equivalent (CO2 e), and the earning of profits through the concept of Social Carbon Cost (SCC). The case study is a small coastal city in Libya where 6% of electricity is assumed to be generated from renewable sources. At times when renewable energy (RE) output exceeds the demand for power, the surplus is used for powering the production of hydrogen by electrolysis, thus storing the energy and creating an emission-free fuel. Two scenarios are tested based on short and long term SCCs. In the short term scenario, the amount of fossil fuel energy saved matches the renewable energy produced, which equates to the same amount of curtailed O&G production. The O&G-producing region can earn profits in two ways: (1) by cutting down CO2 emissions as a result of a reduction in O&G production and (2) by replacing an amount of fossil fuel with electrolytically-produced hydrogen which creates no CO2 emissions. In the short term scenario, the value of SCC saved is nearly 39% and in the long term scenario, this rose to 83%.

This study is a part of that collective effort to make offshore operations safe and decrease the associated risks. The main objective of this study is to quantify and categorize the risk associated with a representative well in the Gulf of Mexico during its normal production operations. In order to achieve an appropriate balance between safety and economics of deepwater oil and gas operations, Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) techniques can be successfully used. Quantified risk is computed from the product of blowout frequency and volume of oil spilled as a consequence. Blowout frequency is calculated from Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and spilled oil volume is estimated from simulating multiphase fluid flow and heat transfer in wellbores. A large number wells are completed with some sort of bottom hole sand control elements to prevent production of sand. The failure of these control elements may have severe consequence and in some cases may result in uncontrolled hydrocarbon flow to the environment as well. A representative production well from the Mississippi Canyon in the Gulf of Mexico is selected for the for quantitative risk assessment (QRA) analysis. The well is completed with cased hole gravel pack and with sand control elements in place. The representative reservoir properties for this well are selected from the literature and uncertainties in properties are accounted for by fitting lognormal distribution and carrying out Monte Carlo simulations. P50 value for the reservoir properties from Monte Carlo simulation is used to find worst case discharge rates by using a commercially available multiphase flow simulator with black oil model.A Fault Tree is constructed to find the blowout probability based on the equipment failure data. From the minimal cut set method the importance and sensitivity of different well bather is analyzed and most important areas to focus on are identified.

Since the early 2000s, the Mediterranean Sea has been named a `maritime cemetery' by activists(1) and critical migration scholars. However, over the last two years migrant deaths at the borders have gained more and more attention in the media and EU political debate after two deadly shipwrecks near the island of Lampedusa on 3 and 11 October 2013, causing the deaths of 636. Since then, the Mediterranean has become the focus for a practice of `counting the dead' that has been at the core of databases set up by human rights groups, migration agencies and NGOs. The number of deaths is, however, difficult to ascertain: according to the International Organization for Migration ( IOM), for instance, in 2014 3,072 people died in the Mediterranean, 2 while UNHCR counted 3,419 dead migrants in the same year; in 2011, according to UNHCR's statistics, about 1,500 migrants died in the Mediterranean, 3 but human rights associations estimate that the real number is around 3,000. The differences in statistics are very often the result of the choice whether to count missing persons; that is, those migrants who supposedly died but whose corpses have not been found. The Deaths at the Borders Database, for example, produced by an academic research team based at the University of Amsterdam, counts exclusively migrant deaths recorded by states in civil registries. 4 It is precisely in this gap between the countable deaths and the uncountable ones that, I suggest, it becomes necessary to put into place an alternative politics, one that accounts for border deaths beyond the logic of mapping and counting.",,,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,0,1,32,,,0300-211X,0030-211X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-07-01,WOS:000367684800001,,

Results from these models are used to estimate per-barrel energy intensities (power, heat), which are scaled to generate country-level demand for heat and power. Multiple solar resource quality cutoff criteria are used to determine which regions may profitably use solar. Potential solar thermal capacity ranges from 19 to 44 GW(th) in upstream operations, and from 21 to 95 GW(th) in downstream operations. Potential PV deployment ranges from 6 to 11 GW(e) in upstream operations and 17-91 GW(e) in downstream operations. The ranges above are due to both per-bbl variation in energy intensity, as well as uncertainty in solar resource quality criteria. Potential solar deployment in upstream operations would displace a much smaller fraction of upstream energy use because a large fraction of global upstream energy use is are either offshore or in high latitude regions (e.g., Russia, Canada, Central Asia).

An indigenous microbial consortium collected from the produced water of a Brazilian offshore field was used as inoculum. The presence of 150 mg/L volatile fatty acids (VFAA ' s) in the injection water contributed to a high biological electron acceptors demand and the establishment of anaerobic sulfate-reducing conditions. Continuous injection of nitrate (up to 25 mg/L) for 90 days did not inhibit souring. Contrariwise, in nitrogen-limiting conditions, the addition of nitrate stimulated the proliferation of delta-Proteobacteria (including SRB) and the associated sulfide concentration. Denitrification-specific nirK or nirS genes were not detected. A sharp decrease in water interfacial tension (from 20.8 to 14.5 mN/m) observed concomitantly with nitrate consumption and increased oil recovery (4.3 % v/v) demonstrated the benefits of nitrate injection on MEOR. Overall, the results support the notion that the addition of nitrate, at this particular oil reservoir, can benefit MEOR by stimulating the proliferation of fortuitous biosurfactant-producing bacteria.

Nevertheless, a significant number of studies report from very positive to negative environmental implications from growing and processing energy crops, thus great uncertainty still remains on this argument. The present study focused on the cradle-to-grave impact assessments of alternative scenarios including annual and perennial energy crops for electricity/heat or first and second generation transport fuels, giving special emphasis to agricultural practices which are frequently surprisingly neglected in Life Cycle Assessment studies despite a not secondary relevance on final outcomes. The results show that cradle-to-farm gate impacts, i.e. including the upstream processes, may account for up to 95% of total impacts, with dominant effects on marine water ecotoxicity. Therefore, by increasing the sustainability of crop management through minimizing agronomic inputs, or with a complementary use of crop resides, can be expected to significantly improve the overall sustainability of bioenergy chains, as well as the competitiveness against fossil counterparts. Once again, perennial crops resulted in substantially higher environmental benefits than annual crops. It is shown that significant amount of emitted CO2 can be avoided through converting arable lands into perennial grasslands. Besides, due to lack of certain data, soil carbon storage was not included in the calculations, while N2O emission was considered as omitted variable bias (1% of N-fertilization). Therefore, especially for perennial grasses, CO2 savings were reasonably higher that those estimated in the present study. For first generation biodiesel, sunflower showed a lower energy-based impacts than rapeseed, while wheat should be preferred over maize for first generation bioethanol given its lower land-based impacts. For second generation biofuels and thermo-chemical energy, switchgrass provided the highest environmental benefits. With regard to bioenergy systems, first generation biodiesel was less impacting than first generation bioethanol; bioelectricity was less impacting than first generation biofuels and second generation bioethanol by thermo-chemical hydrolysis, but highly impacting than Biomass-to-Liquid biodiesel and second generation bioethanol through enzymatic hydrolysis.

Due to the complex influence of the marine environment, there is a lot of noise and baseline drift in the signals collected by hydrophones. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a denoising and baseline drift removal algorithm for MEMS vector hydrophone based on whale-optimized variational mode decomposition (VMD) and correlation coefficient (CC). Firstly, the power spectrum entropy (PSE), which reflects the variation characteristics of the signal frequency is selected as the fitness function of the whale-optimization algorithm to find the parameters (K,alpha) of the VMD. It is easier to find the global optimal solution of the parameters by combining the whale-optimization algorithm. Then, using the VMD algorithm after obtaining the parameters, the original signal is decomposed to obtain the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and calculating the correlation coefficients (CCs) between the IMFs and the original signal. Finally, the CC threshold is used to remove the noise IMFs, and the rest of the useful IMFs are reconstructed to complete the denoising and baseline drift removal process of the original signals. In the simulation experiments, the algorithm proposed in this paper shows better performance by comparing conventional digital signal-processing methods and the related algorithms proposed recently. Applied in the experiments of a MEMS hydrophone, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is also verified.

The water-solubility of fluoranthene was too low to provoke a toxic response at any time, whereas the toxicity of 1,3-dimethylnaphthalene and phenanthrene decreased over time in relation to biotransformation of these compounds.

Optimal forest structure was determined using newly established growth models while considering primary timber production objectives as well as non-timber objectives for inaccessible areas and social and political pressures on land management. With currently planned management the forests of the Ormanustu Planning Unit (OPU) in the Black Sea region of northern Turkey are likely to become an important C sink. To quantify this potential C sink and understand its implication to the regional carbon budget and future forest management, we estimated the changes in the OPU between 1973 and 2006. Based on four periods of data for the OPU forests obtained from the Forest Management and Planning Office of Turkey, we used allometric biomass and C regression equations along with biomass expansion factors to estimate the forest biomass carbon pool for each of four inventory years 1973, 1984, 1997, and 2006. Since 1973, OPU forests have accumulated 110.2 Au 10(3) tons of C as a result of forest expansion and the growth of extant forests, increasing by 50.8 % from 217 Au 10(3) tons in 1973 to 327.2 Au 10(3) tons C in 2006. Hardwood and softwood forests accounted for 44 and 56 % of carbon accumulation during this period, respectively.

The increase in demand of energy requires unconventional forms of energy, and gas hydrates are considered as one of these potential future energy sources. Therefore, technology has been developed to measure properties of gas hydrate bearing formations after and during drilling. In this context, numerical simulation of coupled waves in borehole drilling can contribute to improve information about the gas hydrate reservoir. We model the relationship between bottom simulating reflector and wave propagation along the drillstring. In particular, the bottom simulating reflector is associated with a change of wave propagation velocity due to alternated formation properties. In case of presence of free gas in an overpressured condition, the velocity of the coupled wave in the outer fluid decreases because the formation stiffness decreases. Synthetic data provides an excellent means in studying what happens when a borehole crosses a gas hydrate zone. Moreover, numerical simulation of coupled waves, adopted jointly with the most conventional methods, can contribute to add a small piece of knowledge for better understanding of the hydrate and free gas physical properties.

The goal of the study was to determine whether or not refinery wastewater reclamation for different industrial purposes, namely boiler feedwater, cooling water and fire water, leads to an overall benefit across different environmental aspects, besides alleviating freshwater resources, when compared to current wastewater disposal practices. The basis for the assessment was the hypothetical scale-up of a demonstration plant tested with real wastewaters from November 2018 to May 2019 at the Izmit petroleum refinery operated by Tupras. This demonstration plant consisted of different treatment modules, including dissolved air flotation, ceramic membrane bioreactor, catalytic wet-air oxidation, advanced oxidation with ozone and hydrogen peroxide, and reverse osmosis. The LCA was conducted following consequential modelling principles, and six environmental indicators were analysed in detail at midpoint level: global warming, respiratory inorganics, marine ecotoxicity, aquatic eutrophication, freshwater consumption and non-renewable energy demand. All three reclamation scenarios (boiler, cooling, fire water) succeeded in achieving a life-cycle freshwater saving, of around 1 m(3) freshwater saved per m(3) refinery wastewater. Beneficial results were also obtained in marine ecotoxicity and aquatic eutrophication, where impact is reduced up to 90% and 84%, respectively. With regard to global warming and non-renewable energy demand, only the boiler feedwater application appeared to involve an improvement over wastewater disposal, showing a net reduction of 2.2 kg CO2-eq and 40 MJ per m(3) wastewater, respectively, thanks to potential thermal energy savings. For cooling makeup water and fire water, impacts were between 2 and 2.5 times higher in these two indicators when compared to wastewater disposal. Finally, the indicator on respiratory inorganic effects, showed higher impact, by a factor 2 to 7, for all reuse scenarios, due to electricity demand, which is linked to the Turkish electricity production mix with a substantial contribution from coal power plants. Thus, the results reflect that achieving a product water of very high quality comes at the price of a high energy demand. Nevertheless, A sensitivity analysis shows that the environmental performance of all scenarios would improve to a great extent when shifting to an electricity mix with a higher share of renewables, as is the current trend in most European countries.

No studies have explored the impacts of coastal geomorphic processes on freshwater wetland carbon budgets. To do so, we modified a saltmarsh carbon budget model for application in freshwater coastal wetlands. We validated the model with data from a shoreline wetland in the Laurentian Great Lakes. The model generates the carbon budget by differencing carbon export and carbon storage. The inputs for carbon storage are the carbon inventory and maximum wetland age. Inputs for carbon export include erosion rates and overwash extent. The model demonstrates that the wetland examined in this study transitioned to a source of carbon during periods of erosion. In fact, the net carbon export between 2015 and 2018 was 10% of the wetland's original carbon stock. This study indicates that geomorphic change can dictate whether and how freshwater coastal wetlands serve as sources or sinks for terrestrial carbon, and that carbon stocks can fluctuate on a geologically rapid timescale. We recommend that such geomorphic processes be considered when developing carbon budgets for these marginal environments.

An innovative working technique for oil exploration is proposed, as the mineralogy of micron-sized crystals grown in two flooded chalk samples (Liege, Belgium) was successfully investigated by Raman spectroscopy. The drilled chalk cores were flooded with MgCl2 for ca. 1.5 (Long Term Test) and 3 years (Ultra Long Term Test) under North Sea reservoir conditions (Long Term Test: 130 degrees C, 1 PV/day, 9.3 MPa effective stress; Ultra Long Term Test: 130 degrees C, varying between 1-3 PV/day, 10.4 MPa effective stress). Raman spectroscopy was able to identify the presence of recrystallized magnesite along the core of the Long Term Test up to 4 cm from the injection surface, down to the crystal size of 1-2 mu m. In the Ultra Long Term Test core, the growth of MgCO3 affected nearly the entire core (7 cm). In both samples, no dolomite or high-magnesium calcite secondary growth could be detected when analysing 557 and 90 Raman spectra on the Long and Ultra Long Term Test, respectively.

Long term stability (preservation of solution viscosity) within the anaerobic reservoir is a fundamental property of the polymer chemical and consequently highly important for choosing a proper product. For high temperature and/or high salinity reservoirs co-polymers of acrylamide (AM) and acrylamide tertiary butyl sulfonic acid (ATBS) have become common in the industry.The present work aimed at developing generic stability diagrams for such polymers dissolved in seawater (SW). Herein a two-step approach was attempted where stability versus ATBS content was measured at elevated temperature. Thereafter these data were extrapolated to lower temperature. To arrive at a sound extrapolation knowledge of hydrolysis kinetics for the two species, AM and ATBS, was needed. Aqueous solutions of AM-ATBS and AA-ATBS co-polymers were therefore stored at elevated temperature (82-140 degrees C) and progressive changes in microstructure followed by use of C-13 NMR spectroscopy.A steady increase in polymer stability with ATBS content was observed up to around 70 mol%. From 70 to 80 mol% the robustness sharply improved. A striking observation was that stability loss, defined as < 80% remaining viscosity, occurred before significant amounts of ATBS had reacted even at the highest ATBS contents. Acrylamide (AM) hydrolysis was found to be inhibited by the presence of ATBS. This reduced AM conversion rate was believed to be the main reason for increased stability.For the brines tested herein hydrolysis rate was virtually uninfluenced by hardness/salinity, while viscosity was largely impacted. Hence it was concluded that different viscosity loss in various brines stems from carboxylate complexation equilibria and not altered hydrolysis rates.Temperature extrapolation was found to fit a simple Arrhenius approach and it has been suggested that the function should be sound up to around 70 mol% ATBS. With this methodology, the current dataset enabled the construction of a stability diagram for ATBS polymers (0-70 mol% ATBS) dissolved in seawater.",,,,,,,,,21,2,0,0,0,0,23,,,0920-4105,1873-4715,,,,,,,,,,"STATOIL ASA, Trondheim, NorwaySINTEF Ind, Trondheim, NorwaySNF SAS, Andrezieux, France",SNF SAS,,,2018-08-15,WOS:000440428800046,,

The paper also looks at accelerated aging tests and field data that demonstrate repeatable performance of subsea connectors over hundreds of mate cycles. This paper will also present information concerning the robustness of fiber optic interconnects to handle subsea interventions and installations, highlighting recent advancements in the connector designs to allow easy and repeatable mating and demating of these devices in the harsh subsea environments. Finally, another impediment to common use of the fiber-optic connectors is the perceived technology readiness with successful deployment history. The paper dissects the relevant reliability data from the use of these connectors over the past 15 years and uncovers important inferences on the reliability of subsea fiber optic interconnects.",,,,,Washington State Conference and Trade Center (WSCTC)Washington State Conference and Trade Center (WSCTC),"SEP 20-23, 2010SEP 20-23, 2010",IEEE; Marine Technol; OESIEEE; Marine Technol; OES,"Seattle, WASeattle, WA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4244-4333-8,,,,,,,,,"Teledyne ODI, Daytona Beach, FL 32114 USA",Teledyne ODI,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000287539100189,,

Laboratory test and field application show that the synthetic encapsulator EBA-20 can improve the viscosity and yield value of drilling fluid and reduce the fluid loss of drilling fluid. Meanwhile, its temperature resistance and salt tolerance are also better The contents of main heavy metals, such as chromium and mercury, are under the standard level of GB4284-84; the value of acute biotoxicity test EC50 is greater than 30,000 mg/L, which has little influence on environment; the value of biodegradability BC is 20.1, which shows that EBA-20 is biodegradable and is useful for drilling fluid system to improve its environmental protection performance.

P. australis exhibited strong resistance to negative impacts when oil was applied to shoots alone, while reductions in above- and belowground plant growth were apparent when oil was applied to the soil or with repeated shoot-oiling. Although soil-oiling compromised plant function, mortality of P. australis did not occur.

Cultural exploitation of wetland areas, such as excavation during exploration for fossil fuel and minerals, draining for farming of grain and fiber and production of animal protein, invariably results in the oxidation of the carbon storage sink. Destructive wetland alterations which reduce or remove the vegetative cover also decrease the fixation of atmospheric carbon, thus resulting in a net carbon release from wetlands. Wetland excavation for peat extraction is estimated to oxidize 472 metric tons of stored carbon per 1000 metric tons of dry peat combusted, while 375 metric tons of carbon are releeased from one hectare of mangrove swamp cleared and dug out for fish pond construction.

Several oil fields of Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Iran might be sources of oil spills and lead to the formation of these tar balls. For source identification, 6 tar ball samples were collected from the Southwest beaches of the Caspian Sea and subjected to fingerprint analysis based on the distribution of the source-specific biomarkers of pentacyclic tri-terpanes and steranes. Comparing the diagenic ratios revealed that the tar balls were chemically similar and originated from the same source. Results of double ratioplots (e.g., C-29/C-30 versus Sigma C-31-C-35/C-30 and C-28 alpha beta beta/(C-27 alpha beta beta + C-29 alpha beta beta) versus C-29 alpha beta beta/(C-27 alpha beta beta + C-28 alpha beta beta)) in the tar balls and oils from Iran, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan indicated that the tar balls might be the result of spills from Turkmenistan oil. Moreover, principle component analysis (PCA) using biomarker ratios on the tar balls and 20 crude oil samples from different wells of Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkmenistan oils showed that the tar balls collected at the Southwest beaches are highly similar to the Turkmenistan oil but one of the Azerbaijan oils (from Bahar field oils) was found to be also slightly close to the tar balls. The weathering characterizations based on the presence of UCM (unresolved complex mixture) and low/high molecular weight ratios (L/H) of alkanes and PAHs indicated the tar ball samples have been significantly influenced by natural weathering processes such as evaporation, photo-degradation and biodegradation.

However, to date, there has been little investigation of patterns of genetic variation in the response to water stress in sugarcane. Field experiments were conducted over 3 years under fully irrigated and managed water stress conditions at two locations in Northern Queensland in Australia. Eighty-nine genetically diverse clones were evaluated for their yield performance and sugar attributes. Water stress treatments reduced cane yield [tonnes of cane per hectare (TCH)] and total dry matter (TDM) by 1752% and 2056%, respectively, compared with irrigated treatments in the same experiments. Nevertheless, there was little genotypeenvironment interaction variation for TCH, TDM, or commercial cane sugar (CCS), and hence high genetic correlations between the irrigated and water stress treatments across environments. Both commercial and unselected clones performed poorly under severe stress environments, while the commercial clones outperformed the unselected clones under mild and moderate stress conditions. The results presented here highlight the contribution of intrinsic potential yields (yield under well-irrigated conditions) of some selected and unselected clones to maintain relatively high productivity in a range of moderate stress conditions imposed. The physiological basis for the high genetic correlations is at present unclear, but some explanations are hypothesized. The choice of stress levels in selection trials would not appear to be a critical issue for sugarcane breeding programmes, at least for the early phases of selection, where similar ranking clones across a range of moderate water stresses may be expected.",,,,,,,,,74,4,0,0,49,1,81,,,0022-0957,1460-2431,,,,,,,,,,"BSES Ltd, Ayr, Qld 4807, AustraliaCSIRO Plant Ind, Australian Trop Sci & Innovat Precinct, Aitkenvale, Qld 4814, AustraliaBSES Ltd, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia",,,,2012-10-01,WOS:000309919500024,22996675,

However, with the increasing productions from offshore deepwater and shale gas fields, halite scale occurrence becomes more frequent, leading to significant technical and financial challenges to productions. Although low-salinity water dilution remains the primary approach in controlling halite scale threat, chemical inhibition has been evaluated as an alternative halite control strategy due to the intrinsic issues associated with low-salinity water availability and water quality. There are limited studies concerning the combined effect of metals, especially transition metals with scale inhibitors in halite control. In this study, the combined effect of a number of transition metal ions with two common halite scale inhibitors was evaluated in a laboratory setup. It was found that among the transition metals studied, Pb2+ ion demonstrates a synergistic effect with the scale inhibitors evaluated by considerably extending the halite induction time. The calculated inhibition efficiency also indicates that the presence of Pb2+ improves inhibitor performance. Although Pb2+ is an environmental pollutant, an aqueous Pb2+ concentration of up to 10 mgL(-1) can naturally occur in both natural gas produced water and oilfield produced water. The operators can take advantage of the reported synergistic effect of Pb2+ with scale inhibitors in this study while designing field halite control strategy. The enhanced inhibition efficiency elaborated in this study can be useful in designing the halite scale control strategy, if a decent amount of Pb2+ is present in the produced water.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,,,0920-4105,1873-4715,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Macau, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Fac Sci & Technol, Macau, Peoples R ChinaRice Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX USARice Univ, Nanosyst Engn Res Ctr Nanotechnol Enabled Water T, Houston, TX USA",,,,2019-02-19,WOS:000458153000010,,

The findings demonstrate that it is possible to eliminate or reduce the oxidizing action of water, thereby extending the allowable time before painting after hydrojetting, and that the new corrosion inhibitor technology does not interfere with the final quality of paint adhesion.Design/methodology/approach - Metallic specimens were treated/washed in standard lab condition. A 2 per cent V-active VCI SPH1712 water solution was prepared by diluting the inhibitor in industrial water. Metal sample plates were examined after blasting and after subsequent drying, and were submitted to the paint adhesion tests, cathodic disbondment, total soluble salts, time for formation of flash rust and cyclic corrosion test type III (20 cycles), to evaluate the duration of temporary protection and oxidation prevention and influence on paint adherence.Findings - Using the V-active VCI proposed technology, it was possible to minimize or eliminate the oxidizing action of the water when the metal is exposed to saline moisture in a closed environment, extending the acceptable time before painting without interfering with the final quality of painting.Practical implications - The proposed technology allows an increase in the prepared (wet blasted) steel surface during cleaning and preparation, thereby reducing labor and product costs, and reduces water consumption during the preparation process. Practical applications in the shipbuilding, ship maintenance and oil and gas production industries include the preservation of internal tubes and pipes, protection during hydrostatic test processes and cleaning with water and corrosion prevention in diesel tanks contaminated with water.Originality/value - The intent of this paper is to present the obtained results for a new formulation of organic chemical inhibitors that use water as the application medium. In addition to this property, this group of organic inhibitors maintains the properties of volatile inhibitors.

At present, however, there is no literature on the migration, deposition and blockage of micron-sized sand particles (<44 mm) after their flowing into the wellbore with the formation fluid. To deal with this situation, this paper took the sand particles in a throttling helical tube section for water transport in the process of depressurization hydrate exploitation as the research object. After a geometric model of flow channel was established for numerical simulation, the migration and deposition laws of micron-sized sand particles were analyzed and the critical non-deposition water velocity of micronsized sand particles under different conditions was obtained. And the following research results were obtained. First, micron-sized sand particles are mainly accumulated in the helical tube section of a complex pipeline, and the deposition of sand particles decreases with the increase of water velocity. The sand particles deposited in the upper part of the helical tube section are more difficult to clean than those in the lower part. Second, the critical non-deposition water velocity increases gradually with the increase of sand particle size and sand production concentration. Third, the variables are nondimensionalized by applying the Buckingham-II theorem. And the model for predicting the sand deposition concentration in the local complex wellbore section during hydrate production test can be obtained using the OriginPro 2019 non-linear fitting tool. Fourth, based on the proposed concept of sand deposition concentration ratio, combined with the deposition prediction model, it is convenient to calculate critical non-deposition water velocity of micron-sized sand particles and to judge the situation of sand deposition in the wellbore. In conclusion, a method for determining the critical non-deposition water velocity of micron-sized sand particles in the local complex wellbore section during the hydrate production test is proposed. And by virtue of this method, the critical non-deposition water velocity of micron-sized sand particles under three particle sizes and three sand production concentrations is obtained respectively. And the research results provide a basis for the reasonable arrangement of hydrate production system and pressure reduction range. (c) 2020 Sichuan Petroleum Administration.

In moderately oiledmarshes, surface soil total petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations were similar to 70 mg g(-1) nine months after the spill. Though initial impacts of moderate oiling were evident, Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus aboveground biomass and total live belowground biomass were equivalent to reference marshes within 24-30 months post spill. In contrast, heavily oiled marsh plants did not fully recover from oiling with surface soil total petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations that exceeded 500 mg g(-1) nine months after oiling. Initially, heavy oiling resulted in near complete plant mortality, and subsequent recovery of live aboveground biomass was only 50% of reference marshes 42 months after the spill. Heavy oiling also changed the vegetation structure of shoreline marshes from a mixed Spartina-Juncus community to predominantly Spartina; live Spartina aboveground biomass recovered within 2-3 years, however, Juncus showed no recovery. In addition, live belowground biomass (0-12 cm) in heavily oiled marshes was reduced by 76% three and a half years after the spill. Detrimental effects of heavy oiling on marsh plants also corresponded with significantly lower soil shear strength, lower sedimentation rates, and higher vertical soil-surface erosion rates, thus potentially affecting shoreline salt marsh stability.

It also has local, national and international implications for energy security and susceptible environmental receptors. This paper specifically focuses on Nigeria, a country often affected by complex environmental problems associated with oil and gas activities. Partly because Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in Nigeria was only promulgated in 1992, there has been no specific study of pipeline interdiction and how it could be better addressed in future EIAs, especially at river crossings where oil pollution is usually significant. Therefore through a careful collation of data from different sources, this paper for the first time aims to: (1) evaluate how pipeline interdiction has been addressed in sampled EIAs; (2) assess interdiction trend per unit of pipeline length over a 16-year period; (3) identify points on pipeline river crossings that are especially sensitive to oil spills. A linearly-weighted equation was used to estimate interdiction per 1000 pipeline kilometres per year. River network and pipeline shapefiles were geoprocessed in ArcGIS 9.2 to identify river crossing locations and the spatiotemporal trend of interdiction was plotted. Key findings include: (a) high interdiction rates per 1000 pipeline kilometres ranging from 1.4 to 735 per year; (b) at least 115 pipeline river crossing locations exist in Nigeria and constitute potential oil-spill hazards; (c) these hitherto unavailable pipeline river crossing data unsurprisingly show the majority of such locations are within southern Nigeria. These results should guide future oilfield developments, including oil production and transportation facility projects, through efficient scoping and mitigation strategies.

The reservoir-pressure coefficient usually exceeds 1.6, with formation temperature greater than 180 degrees C. Challenges are faced for well drilling and completion in these HT/HP reservoirs. A solid-free well-completion fluid with safety density greater than 1.8 g/cm(3) and excellent thermal endurance is strongly needed in the industry. Because of high cost and/or corrosion and toxicity problems, the application of available solid-free well-completion fluids such as cesium formate brines, bromine brines, and zinc brines is limited in some cases. In this paper, novel potassium-based phosphate well-completion fluids were developed. Results show that the fluid can reach the maximum density of 1.815 g/cm(3) at room temperature, which makes a breakthrough on the density limit of normal potassium-based phosphate brine. The corrosion rate of N80 steel after the interaction with the target phosphate brine at a high temperature of 180 degrees C is approximately 0.1853 mm/a, and the regained-permeability recovery of the treated sand core can reach up to 86.51%. Scanning-electron-microscope (SEM) pictures also support the corrosion-evaluation results. The phosphate brine shows favorable compatibility with the formation water. The biological toxicity-determination result reveals that it is only slightly toxic and is environmentally acceptable. In addition, phosphate brine is highly effective in inhibiting the performance of clay minerals. The cost of phosphate brine is approximately 44 to 66% less than that of conventional cesium formate, bromine brine, and zinc brine. This study suggests that the phosphate brine can serve as an alternative high-density solid-free well-completion fluid during well drilling and completion in HT/HP reservoirs.",,,,,,,,,15,1,0,0,0,0,16,,,1086-055X,1930-0220,,,,,,,,,,"Southwest Petr Univ, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",,,,2019-10-28,WOS:000490783700007,,

Previous to this effort, disposal of military munitions, including chemical warfare materials (CWM) and conventional munitions, in the ocean from World War I through 1970 was done by many nations and was not well documented. A 2001 U.S. Army report entitled Off-shore Disposal of Chemical Agents and Weapons Conducted by the United States indicated that the disposal of CWM in the ocean through 1970 was more widespread geographically than was widely known. In accordance with Section 314, the DoD published updated information on disposals in the 2006 and 2007 Defense Environmental Programs Annual Report to Congress. Two directives implemented in 2006 and 2007, respectively, by the Minerals Management Service referenced an increased concern with unexploded ordnance (UXO) in deep water (NTLs 2006-G12 and 2007-G01). With the industry's increase in deep-water exploration, the potential for encounters with military munitions is increasing. This paper will describe an unprecedented in-depth study that provided the oil and gas industry quantitative avoidance criteria and risk management analysis of CWM including drums that were critical during a routine geohazard survey in the Gulf of Mexico.

Defining a green building is an evolving process with life cycle inventory and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) emerging as key tools in that evolution and definition process. This study used LCIA to determine the environmental footprint associated with manufacturing 38- x 138-mm redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) decking from sustainably managed northern California redwood forests. Primary survey data were collected from four redwood mills that represent 90% of redwood lumber production. The primary data were then weight-averaged on a per-unit basis of 1 m(3) of planed redwood decking (380 oven-dry kg/m(3)) to calculate material flows and energy use. All of the raw material consumption and environmental outputs were assigned to dry planed redwood decking and none to coproducts. The gate-to-gate, cumulative energy consumption associated with manufacturing 1 m(3) of planed redwood decking from 1.8 m(3) of incoming logs was 1.36 GJ/m(3) with 19% of the energy provided by burning wood residues. Emission data produced through modeling the production process found that the estimated biomass and fossil CO2 emissions were 20.9 and 52.9 kg/m(3), respectively. Based on the carbon content of redwood of 53%, a cubic meter of 38- x 138-mm redwood decking product stores 201 kg of carbon and if released into the atmosphere would emit 738 kg of CO2. The amount of carbon stored in redwood decking is equivalent to about 10 times the total CO2 emissions released during the manufacturing process. Low carbon emissions during the manufacturing process and carbon storage during the service life of a redwood deck are positive environmental attributes that should be considered when selecting a decking product.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,0,10,,,0735-6161,,,,,,,,,,,"US Forest Serv, Econ & Stat Unit, USDA, Forest Prod Lab, Madison, WI 53726 USAUniv Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USAUniv Washington, Ctr Int Trade Forest Prod, Seattle, WA 98195 USAHumboldt State Univ, Dept Forestry & Wildland Resources, Arcata, CA 95521 USA",,,,2014-08-15,WOS:000339412800004,,

Both led to large oil spills: more than 10 000 tons of fuel oil n degrees 2 were released in the Atlantic Ocean in the south of Finistere as a consequence of the Erika and probably five times as much from the Prestige.Detailed analytical characterisations of the fuel oils laden in both Prestige and Erika as well as of other fuel oils n degrees 2 have been performed.The analytical procedure used consisted in physico-chemical parameters such as viscosity, flash point, water content, concentration of insoluble compounds and distillation curves. Furthermore, this characterisation included evaluation of the chemical classes (saturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, resins and asphaltens), research for geochemical markers and quantification of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The characterisation was carried out on samples collected in both ships as well as in the marine and shoreline environment.The results obtained showed that the characterisation was quite appropriate to identify precisely the product laden in the ships and to recognise them. It was concluded that two complementary techniques were sufficient to assess the origin of the oil sample: simulated distillation to give a fingerprint of the oil, on the one hand, and analysis of geochemical markers including hopanes and steranes, on the other.

One of them is an aridity event, generally placed in the interval 11,000-10,000 BP, and synchronous with the Younger Dryas cold episode of the temperate regions, that has been explained by the influence of the Atlantic Ocean circulation on global climate.In this paper we present high resolution (50 to 150 years) studies of organic matter and pollen undertaken on a new core from the Rusaka peat bog (3 degrees 26' South, 29 degrees 37' East, 2070 m altitude), dated by the conventional (12 dates) and the AMS methods (18 dates obtained on bulk sediment and macroremains). Although the sediment at the bottom of the core was deposited during the last glacial period prior to 21,000 BP, the dating provides a reliable chronology for the last 12,000 BP only. Several vegetational changes are documented in the interval 12,000-9000 BP, but their chronological placement can only be achieved with a few years of uncertainties. A great dispersion of AMS dates is attributed to contamination by charcoal dated between 11,700 and 11,500 BP, and to a possible age plateau at ca. 10,000 BP. Therefore the results are preferably presented versus depth to keep synchronism in the stratigraphic placement of the successive events.At Rusaka, increase in carbon storage, C/N ratio for terrestrial plants, and tree cover began at ca. 12,000 BP, soon after the swamp had been established. This date is in good agreement with a major increased hydrological balance well-documented throughout the intertropical region. The forest installation is progressive, rather complex and seen as a two step process. The first forest phase (11,700 BP to 10,600 BP) is dominated by Hagenia, a montane taxon, in good correspondance with previous records from other authors in East African mountains. The second forest regeneration took place post 10,000 BP, after a clearly reversed trend of tree cover from 10,600 to 10,000 BP, ending with a short episode of minimum trees lasting no more than about 200 years. But there is no indication of cooling whatsoever, and the opening of the forest is better explained by increased aridity, rather than normal pattern of forest succession. This will remain a controversal interpretation among palynologists until high resolution pollen data can be obtained for the 13,000 BP and earlier period. Nevertheless, the timing of the arid episode at Rusaka is in good agreement with other evidence mentioned from highland and lowland pollen data. A detailed comparison with 25 available pollen diagrams is limited by poor or inconsistent dating or low resolution of the pollen data. Nevertheless pollen from four of them document an arid event in good agreement with its timing at Rusaka and high resolution isotopic results from two sites in equatorial lowlands and from the Sahel. This work shows that the arid Younger Dryas occurred at the same time both in lowlands and highlands, and therefore was most likely a precipitation signal rather than a response to temperature decrease.",,,,,,,,,59,0,0,0,21,0,62,,,0277-3791,1873-457X,,,,,,,,,,"LUND UNIV, DEPT ECOL, GLOBAL SYST GRP, S-22362 LUND, SWEDENGDR TANDETRON, CTR FAIBLES RADIOACT, F-91198 GIF SUR YVETTE, FRANCE",GDR TANDETRON,,,1995-01-01,WOS:A1995UH76700010,,

Coal-fired power production is a water-limited industry that requires novel approaches to waste water treatment and recycling. In this study, a freshwater macroalga (genus Oedogonium) was cultivated in contaminated ash water amended with flue gas (containing 20% CO2) at an Australian coal-fired power station. The continuous process of macroalgal growth and intracellular metal sequestration reduced the concentrations of all metals in the treated ash water. Predictive modelling shows that the power station could feasibly achieve zero discharge of most regulated metals (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn) in waste water by using the ash water dam for bioremediation with algal cultivation ponds rather than storage of ash water. Slow pyrolysis of the cultivated algae immobilised the accumulated metals in a recalcitrant C-rich biochar. While the algal biochar had higher total metal concentrations than the algae feedstock, the biochar had very low concentrations of leachable metals and therefore has potential for use as an ameliorant for low-fertility soils.

Design of efficient strategies for safe, long-term storage requires the capability to efficiently simulate processes taking place on very different temporal and spatial scales. The physical laws describing CO2 storage are the same as for hydrocarbon recovery, but the characteristic spatial and temporal scales are quite different. Petroleum reservoirs seldom extend more than tens of kilometers and have operational horizons spanning decades. Injected CO2 needs to be safely contained for hundreds or thousands of years, during which it can migrate hundreds or thousands of kilometers. Because of the vast scales involved, conventional 3D reservoir simulation quickly becomes computationally unfeasible. Large density difference between injected CO2 and resident brine means that vertical segregation will take place relatively quickly, and depth-integrated models assuming vertical equilibrium (VE) often represent a better strategy to simulate long-term migration of CO2 in large-scale aquifer systems. VE models have primarily been formulated for relatively simple rock formations and have not been coupled to 3D simulation in a uniform way. In particular, known VE simulations have not been applied to models of realistic geology in which many flow compartments may exist in-between impermeable layers. In this paper, we generalize the concept of VE models, formulated in terms of well-proven reservoir simulation technology, to complex aquifer systems with multiple layers and regions. We also introduce novel formulations for multi-layered VE models by use of both direct spill and diffuse leakage between individual layers. This new layered 3D model is then coupled to a state-of-the-art, 3D black-oil type model. The formulation of the full model is simple and exploits the fact that both models can be written in terms of generalized multiphase flow equations with particular choices of the relative permeabilities and capillary pressure functions. The resulting simulation framework is very versatile and can be used to simulate CO2 storage for any combination of 3D and VE-descriptions, thereby enabling the governing equations to be tailored to the local structure. We demonstrate the simplicity of the model formulation by extending the standard flow-solvers from the open-source Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST), allowing immediate access to upscaling tools, complex well modeling, and visualization features. We demonstrate this capability on both conceptual and industry-grade models from a proposed storage formation in the North Sea. The current implementation assumes a sharp interface for the VE model, where the capillary forces do not lead to a capillary fringe. While the examples are taken specifically from CO2 storage applications, the framework itself is general and can be applied to many problems in which parts of the domain are dominated by gravity segregation. Such applications include gas storage and hydrocarbon recovery from gas reservoirs with local layering structure.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,1420-0597,1573-1499,,,,,,,,,,"SINTEF Digital, Oslo, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway",,,,2019-03-08,WOS:000459423400001,,

Two particularly notable episodes have occurred in the last few years. In 2013, 746 million m(3)/yr of water from Lake Okeechobee was discharged to the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean estuaries, much of it in the summer wet season, with significant ecological disruption on both coasts. In February 2016, an unusually high amount of precipitation in the dry season (>30 cm in January 2015) led to 326 million m(3) of polluted Lake Okeechobee water being discharged to the sea over a 2-week period in early February. The obvious solution to this estuarine pollution is to allow water from the lake to flow to south as it historically did before water management was imposed on the lake and watershed. But that would cause polluted water to flow to the oligotrophic and much treasured Florida Everglades. We estimate that the water quality issue could be solved by creating an additional 40,000 Ha of stormwater treatment wetlands. Those would complement the 23,000 Ha of stormwater treatment wetlands that have already been created. Creating a deepwater reservoir to store the excess water is not a sustainable option.

Hence in order to identify the risky areas, two scenarios have been developed depending on the type and amount of pollutants. In this study it is concluded that Yenikale, Inciralti and Guzelbahce will be at risk of contamination in case of accidental oil spill at Yenikale Entrance. Finally, the PISCES 2 software provided highly reliable solutions in evaporation rate and dispersion rate calculations when compared to approaches accepted in the literature. However in the surface area calculations, there is a serious difference between the size of the area calculated by the software and the size of the area proposed by oil spill science.",,,,,,,,,25,2,0,0,3,0,25,,,0025-326X,1879-3363,,,,,,,,,,"Dokuz Eylul Univ, Maritime Fac, Dept Marine Transportat Engn, Tinaztepe Campus, Izmir, Turkey",,,,2018-03-09,WOS:000425569400026,29421091,

Even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has offered no scenario that would stabilize atmospheric levels. The capacity of the oceans to absorb CO(2) is limited to about 40% of the level of emissions in 1990. Shared equitably among the present-day world population, per capita emissions of 35% of the current European average would only return the world to 100% of 1990 emission levels. Yet world population will probably grow by 25% by 2050 and, between 1990 and 2007, global emissions increased by 29%. Our current global trajectory is hurtling us toward ever-higher levels, perhaps even disaster.Consequently, near-zero-emitting sources are the only approaches to energy generation that should be deployed. Nuclear power, with its immense energy density, is the only available source that qualifies for widespread deployment. Existing alternative options are not and cannot effectively contribute (see e.g. MacKay, 2008(1)). The weakness in wind is the need for back-up and supplementation, not so much from its short-term fickleness but its seasonal variability. Carbon capture and storage would have to achieve far higher levels of capture than currently seem feasible. Hydroelectricity has limited remaining potential as well as needing careful deployment to avoid collateral emissions. Aggressive conservation and efficiency measures reduce but do not solve the growth in energy demand and usage. Global economic downturns provide temporary relief but huge social political pain, and energy supply security concerns remain unresolved issue for many countries, even today.Of course nuclear alone would face an overwhelming challenge. We shall need to deploy massive improvements in the efficiency with which energy is used. Solar power in various forms has promise and could have a substantial role at lower latitudes in consistently sunny areas though photovoltaic electricity is still a high-cost option. Geothermal and various forms of ocean-derived energy have development potential.However, we argue that worldwide deployment of 5000 to 10 000 nuclear reactors by 2050 is the only clearly accessible pathway to CO(2) stabilization that exists today. This will require extension of the resource beyond once-through cycles and so the deployment of advanced reactor types. But it is doable, it is affordable, and our planet must plan to accomplish this deployment.[GRAPHICS](The curves are for the four principal scenarios of energy usage developed by the IPCC and presented in the TAR assessment.)",,,,,17th International Conference on Nuclear Engineering17th International Conference on Nuclear Engineering,"JUL 12-16, 2009JUL 12-16, 2009","ASME, Nucl Engn Div; Japan Soc Mech Engineers; Chinese Nucl SocASME, Nucl Engn Div; Japan Soc Mech Engineers; Chinese Nucl Soc","Brussels, BELGIUMBrussels, BELGIUM",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4352-9,,,,,,,,,"Atom Energy Canada Ltd, Chalk River Labs, Chalk River, ON K0J 1J0, Canada",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000290372700112,,

Continual nutrient input and residue retention are needed to attain the C sequestration potential and to maintain the sequestered C. However, few studies have assessed the vulnerability of the sequestered soil C to changes in agricultural management and climate. Here we applied the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to simulate the soil C dynamics to equilibrium under optimal management with 100% residue retention and no nitrogen (N) deficiency at 613 sites across the Australian croplands. We examined the response of sequestered soil C to potential warming and rainfall change, under these optimal practices and under suboptimal management with reduced residue retention and/or N input. On average, soil C was lost at rate of 0.14 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) when residue retention was halfed. Removing all residues doubled the rate of C loss (i.e., 0.28 Mg C ha(-1) y(r-)1). Reducing the application rate by half of the optimal N rate or to zero led to C loss of 0.089 and 0.27 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that C loss rate increased with active C stock (non-inert C) in the sequestered C. Given an active C stock, the loss rate increased with increasing temperature and/or rainfall. Future warming was estimated to increase soil C loss, especially in cooler and/or wetter regions. The effect of potential rainfall change was relatively moderate and depended on the direction (increase or decrease) of rainfall change. Management strategies for effective C sequestration in agroecosystems should and can be developed based on local climatic conditions and soil specific amount of active organic C.

Per the study findings, cross-cutting water policy issues including integrated water resources management, climate change adaptation and gender mainstreaming are more highlighted (TSS = 67%) than country-specific water management issues (TSS = 50%). Specifically, the policy neglects key national issues including protection of coastal regions from the onslaught of sea waves, and water resource protection against oil spills, and its institutional framework for implementation excludes key sector institutions.

Large horsepower (HP) motors are a key part of most projects and require great attention to detail. Motors require relay protection, writing specifications, vetting suppliers, and testing protocols. The goal is to get the desired life expectancy with trouble-free service from the motor and the driven equipment. It is clear that good installation is a key to success. Incorrect installation of field connections and modifications can shorten the life of the motor and instrumentation and in some cases lead to premature failures.

N-alkane biodegradation rate constants were ca. ten-fold higher than the photooxidation rate constants. For the 2-3 ring and 4-5 ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), photooxidation rate constants were 0.08-0.98 day(-1) and 0.01-0.07 day(-1), respectively. The dispersant Corexit enhanced degradation of n-alkanes but not of PAHs. Compared to biodegradation, photooxidation increased transformation of 4-5 ring PAHs by 70% and 3-4 ring alkylated PAHs by 36%. For the first time we observed that sunlight inhibited biodegradation of pristane and phytane, possibly due to inhibition of the bacteria that can degrade branched-alkanes.

Further analysis of the sand revealed high concentrations of hydrocarbon in the oil-coated sand and that the main biomarkers were indicative of biodegradation, even though the oil was buried.A set of experiments was designed to analyze the evolution of oil from tar balls to coatings. The results revealed that biodegradation is a secondary process in the changes that take place in the buried oil, and that water flow slows down the appearance of grey sand and that low salinity may hinder the oil degradation process.

Chlorella sp. had the maximum biomass density on both occasions; it produced 1.2-gL(-1) biomass density in the nutrient-supplemented PPW. Next, Chlorella sp. was grown in 1L PBR to study the contaminant removal efficiencies. After 15days of growth Chlorella sp. could remove 92% of the TN and 73% of the TOC from the PPW.

In this study, dispersibility and biodegradation of chemically dispersed oils with different physical-chemical properties (paraffinic, naphthenic and asphaltenic oils) were compared in natural temperate SW at 13 degrees C. All selected oils were chemically dispersible when well-known commercial dispersants were used. However, interfacial tension (IFT) studies of the dispersed oils showed different IFT properties of the oils at 13 degrees C, and also different leaching of the dispersants from oil droplet surfaces. Biodegradation studies of the chemically dispersed oils were performed in a carousel system, with initial median droplet sizes <30 gm and oil concentrations of 2.5-2.8 mg/L. During biodegradation, oil droplet concentrations were rapidly reduced, in association with the emergence of macroscopic 'flocs'. Biotransformation results showed that half-lives of semivolatile total extractable organic carbon (TEOC), single target 2-to 4-ring PAH, and 22 oil compound groups used as input data in the oil spill contingency model OSCAR, did not differ significantly between the oils (P > 0.05), while n-alkanes half-lives differed significantly (P < 0.05). Biotransformation was associated with rapid microbial growth in all oil dispersions, in association with n-alkane and PAH biotransformation.

Globally, the authors estimate an average of 1.3 kW m(-1) of internal tide energy flux is directed onto continental slopes. On the Oregon slope, internal tide fluxes are smaller, suggesting that it is a relatively weak internal tide sink. Mixing associated with the breaking of internal tides is therefore likely to be larger on other continental slopes.",,,,,,,,,33,1,0,0,3,0,36,,,0022-3670,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USAUniv Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USAUniv Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USAOregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000314179300009,,

However, it is ineffective when dealing with water-sensitive shale that can lead to shale hydration, consequently wellbore instability is compromised. The alternative way to deal with this kind of shale is using synthetic-based mud (SBM) or oil-based mud (OBM). OBM is the best option in terms of technical requirement. Nevertheless, it is toxic and will create environmental problems when it is discharged to onshore or offshore environment. SBM is safer than the OBM. The aim of this research is to formulate a drilling mud system that can carry out its essential functions for shale gas drilling to avoid borehole instability. Ester based SBM has been chosen for the mud formulation. The ester used is methyl-ester C12-C14 derived from palm oil. The best formulation of ester-based drilling fluid was selected by manipulating the oil-water ratio content in the mud which are 70/30, 80/20 and 90/10 respectively. The feasibility of using this mud for shale gas drilling was investigated by measuring the rheological properties, shale reactivity and toxicity of the mud and the results were compared with a few types of OBM and WBM. The best rheological performance can be seen at 80/20 oil-water ratio of ester based mud. The findings revealed that the rheological performance of ester based mud is comparable with the excellent performance of sarapar based OBM and about 80% better than the WBM in terms of fluid loss. Apart from that, it is less toxic than other types of OBM which can maintain 60% prawn's survival even after 96 hours exposure in 100,000 ppm of mud concentration in artificial seawater.",,,,,"3rd International Conference on Manufacturing, Optimization, Industrial and Material Engineering (MOIME)3rd International Conference on Manufacturing, Optimization, Industrial and Material Engineering (MOIME)","MAR 28-29, 2015MAR 28-29, 2015",,"Bali, INDONESIABali, INDONESIA",6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,1757-8981,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Chem Engn, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia",,,,2015-08-09,WOS:000357991500012,,
J,,,,,,,,,"Nazina,Tamara",,Development of the scientific basis of the biogeotechnology for enhanced heavy oil recovery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 1800,2019,"The goal of the Project is to develop the scientific basis of the method for intensification of recovery of heavy oil from oilfields with carbonate reservoirs under the effect of microorganisms. Share of high-viscosity heavy oil in residual reserves increased due to the intensive exploitation of oilfields with light conventional oil. Particular attention is paid to the problem of development of heavy oil deposits composed of carbonate reservoirs. Nowadays, oil reserves associated with carbonate reservoirs containing viscous and high-viscosity heavy oil exceed 30% of all explored reserves in the world and over 50% in Russia. Existing methods for exploitation of oilfields with carbonate reservoirs make it possible to obtain the final oil recovery ratio (ORR) within 0.16‒0.32 from total oil reserves in the oilfield (Ibatullin, 2011). Thus, the development of a new efficient environmentally friendly method of the exposure of the stratum in order to enhance recovery of heavy oil from carbonate collectors is of current importance. Over recent decades, a number of microbiological methods for enhanced oil recovery have been developed (Belyaev et al., 2004; Youssef et al., 2009). Gases, acids, solvents, polymers, and surfactants of microbial origin exhibit oil-displacing properties, which are similar to chemically synthesized analogues; nevertheless, the former are often more efficient. Microbial biopolymers and biosurfactants, obtained on the earth surface, are used to enhance oil recovery. Biotechnologies based on the activation of the vital functions of microorganisms directly in the oil stratum were also proposed. Microbial technologies for enhancement of oil recovery were primarily used in oilfields with sandy reservoirs and light oil. The development of microbial biotechnologies for enhanced heavy oil recovery from carbonate strata with complex geological, petrophysical, and hydrodynamic conditions, as well as with heavy oil, is of current importance. Characteristics of carbonate oil strata genetically related to ancient marine sediments include high content of sulfates, sulfate-reducing bacteria, and hydrogen sulfide in formation water, as well as sulfur-containing components in oil and gas. Carbonate reservoirs are composed of reefs, fragmental limestone, limestone, and dolomite. These rocks are characterized by a wide range of porosity (up to 15%), low permeability, and high fracturing (1.5-2.5%), which provides low efficiency of water‒flooding for enhancement of oil recovery and formation of preferential hydrodynamic flows of injected water along the fractures without affecting the rest of the oil-saturated stratum. The use of gelling components (gels, polysaccharides, etc.) that promote blockage of highly permeable channels and permeability equalizing, as well as the use of fermentative bacteria forming lower acids and CO2 (from the introduced sacchariferous substrates), which dissolve carbonate rocks and increase their porosity and permeability, are therefore promising for oil strata with carbonate reservoirs. Since microorganisms of the oil stratum can have a significant effect on oil displacement, preliminary studies of microbial populations and the processes carried out by them in the stratum are necessary to develop biotechnologies for enhanced heavy oil recovery from carbonate rocks. During the Project 2019, the study will be focused on the search of the producers of exopolysaccharides or fermentative bacteria forming acids. Microorganisms from the deposits of heavy oil in carbonate rocks of the Romashkinskoye and Arkhangelskoe oilfields, which are characterized by high mineralization of formation water (from 30 to 200 g/L), will be the main subjects of research. The microbial community of oil strata with highly mineralized waters is insufficiently studied, which will be one of the tasks of the Project. The functional and phylogenetic microbial diversity in the samples of formation water from two deposits of heavy oil with carbonate reservoirs will be studied using the method of high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes and microbiological methods. The obtained enrichment cultures of aerobic bacteria will be used to isolate the promising strains producing exopolysaccharides. To accomplish this new task of the Project, the search for halophilic and halotolerant producers of exopolysaccharides, which effectively densify aqueous solutions, will be carried out. Polysaccharides produced by the previously isolated members of the genera Salinicola, Chromohalobacter, and Halomonas will be investigated also. Exoglycans will be extracted and purified. Their composition, structure, rheological characteristics and stability at different salinity and temperature will be studied. A new specialist will join the research group; and this will make it possible to apply the scheme of the study of polysaccharides using chemical and physical methods, which was developed in the Laboratory of Carbohydrate Chemistry (Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences). Application of conventional methods of dialysis, lyophilization, extraction, and gel-filtration column chromatography will make it possible to purify polysaccharides from biomass and culture fluid and hydrolyze them; monosaccharides will be identified by GLC analysis of acetylated alditols (polyols). NMR spectroscopy, which includes homonuclear (1H-1H), as well as heteronuclear (1H-13C and 1H-31P) two-dimensional correlation experiments (COSY, TOCSY, NOESY or ROESY, HSQC, HMQC, and HMBC), will be the main method for determination of the polysaccharide structure. Oligosaccharide fragments will be isolated and purified by chromatography on TSK-40 gel. Their structure will be determined using NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The most promising exopolysaccharides, forming high-viscosity solutions (in both purified form and in the form of culture fluid), will be used in experiments on displacement of heavy oil from the stratum models represented by carbonate rocks. Other tasks of the Project 2019 are directly associated with the accomplishment of the tasks of the Project 2016 and aimed at the study of fermentative and hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteria from deposits of heavy oil. At the same time, fermentation products will be analyzed and phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and genomic characteristics of new bacteria of the genera Sphaerochaeta, Soehngenia, Geobacillus, Geotoga, and Actinotalea, will be determined; four new species will be described. Subsequent studies of phylogenetic diversity of aerobic microbial communities growing on heavy oil will be carried out. The patent application for the strain Rhodococcus erythropolis HO-KS22, which is able to generate an oil displacing agent (bioSAS) and possesses the urease activity, will be prepared. Earlier, this strain showed the best results on the oil displacement from the models of the stratum. The scientific novelty of the task is determination of the composition of the poorly studied microbial community of oil strata with heavy oil and high mineralization of formation water in the deposits of carbonate rocks. The composition and structure of exopolysaccharides produced by new halotolerant bacteria of the oil strata will be determined; and the effect of polysaccharides on oil displacement from models of the stratum will be evaluated. The following working hypothesis was accepted for development of the biotechnology for enhanced oil recovery. Injection of polysaccharide solutions made on the surface will result in sealing of highly permeable channels in the reservoir and equilibration of permeability. Introduction of fermenting bacteria adapted to ambient salinity and temperature and using the added sugar-containing substrates to produce lower fatty acids and CO2 (compounds dissolving carbonate rocks), as well as solvents (decreasing oil viscosity), will promote enhanced recovery of residual heavy oil from carbonate collectors. A complex of modern microbiological, molecular ecological, genomic, bioinformatics, physical, and chemical methods will be used to achieve the goal of the Project. The results of the Project 2019 will make it possible to provide new scientific insight into the field of petroleum microbiology, to isolate producers of polysaccharides and organic acids, to study the composition, structure, and rheological characteristics of new exopolysaccharides, as well as to develop the scientific basis of the biotechnology for enhancement of oil recovery from carbonate oil strata with highly mineralized waters (40-150 g/L).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,19-14-11010,,,,,,,,Federal State Institution Federal Research Centre Fundamentals of Biotechnology of the Russian Academy of Sciences,Federal State Institution Federal Research Centre Fundamentals of Biotechnology of the Russian Academy of Sciences,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15292158,,

The study aimed to position the Transport Integrated Gasification (TRIG (TM)'') technology for power generation in the China market where coal gasification has been widely practiced. It assumed a mine mouth project in eastern Inner Mongolia, China and used a low rank coal from the area. Results from the study indicate that the low rank coal TRIG (TM) IGCC is more efficient and with a superior environmental performance and less water usage than the best available conventional ultra- supercritical (USC'') technology in the China market. With environmental regulation compliance costs increasing in China, the low rank coal TRIG (TM) IGCC will become competitive as one of the viable clean coal technologies for power generation. Converting the large reserve of low cost and low heating value coals located in remote areas to electricity for the coastal areas will certainly help these areas manage the increasing pressure for further reductions in emissions from coal firing power plants.

J,,,,,,,,,Laura Robinson,,Carbon cycling in a warming world: a deglacial test case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Feb 01 2019,2019,"Projections of future climate change require us to understand the interactions between carbon and its main reservoirs, including the large natural exchanges between ocean, land and atmosphere. Studies have also shown that uncertainties in modelling the carbon cycle are as important as uncertainties in modelling the physical climate system. Thus it is vital that we develop a better quantitative understanding. The natural component of the carbon cycle has already been significantly perturbed today, so studying the natural processes before human interventions is an important additional test of our knowledge and understanding. This is particularly true when there were abrupt perturbations on the climate system that occurred on human-relevant timescales. A prime target is the transition out of the glacial period, some 20,000 years ago. The transition saw global temperatures increase by ~ 3-5C, sea level rise by 120m and atmospheric pCO2 increase by ~100ppmV. Importantly, a large portion of these changes occurred in rapid events which overprinted the long term deglacial transition. We still do not fully understand how CO2 levels in the atmosphere increased over this time although processes that alter the balance of carbon between the ocean, land and the atmosphere are certainly critical. Indeed, the leading hypothesis to explain the major rise in atmospheric CO2 calls upon release of carbon from the deep ocean that accumulated from the decay of organic matter as it rains down through to the ocean's depths. At the same time changes in the terrestrial biosphere are thought to have contributed through processes including permafrost melting. This link between biological productivity and the exchange of carbon between its reservoirs is a timely topic given concern over the fate of anthropogenic carbon emissions - including ocean acidification and suggestions of long-term excess storage of carbon in the deep sea. However recent studies have provided data that contradict this view of carbon storage and exchange. Evidence has pointed towards climatically-triggered release of geologically-held carbon. The solid Earth contains vast reservoirs of carbon, so small changes in release have the potential to be important to the carbon budget. If release of geologic carbon is indeed sensitive to changes in the climate system, then this process may also be triggered under future climate scenarios. Constraining the potential impact of geologic carbon released in the past has the potential to provide critical new information in projecting future change. The interdisciplinary project team proposes an ambitious programme combining field work, geochemical analyses and integrated modelling to provide specific tests of the competing hypotheses that have been used to explain the rising CO2 levels at the end of the glacial period. We will particularly focus on using radiocarbon to help diagnose the distinct sources of carbon. New data will be based on geochemical analyses on precisely dated deep-sea coral skeletons collected from locations which are key to these tests. We will mount the first Remotely Operated Vehicle research expedition to the Eastern Equatorial Pacific dedicated to systematic collections of corals from depths where release of geological carbon is hypothesised to have occurred. Our second focus will be on the North Atlantic (samples in hand) where changes in ocean circulation and linkages to isolated basins may have played a key role in releasing carbon from the deep ocean. We will integrate these data with existing knowledge and use them in conjunction with climate modelling (including intermediate complexity models and state of the art General Circulation Models) to explore which processes are most important to the Earth system in a warming world. We will also be well placed to formulate a broad synthesis of the processes controlling the carbon cycle during the most pronounced rapid warming period of recent Earth history.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/S001743/1,,,,,,,,University of Bristol,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15411900,,

The CDR potential and possible environmental side effects are estimated for various COA deployment scenarios, assuming olivine as the alkalinity source in ice-free coastal waters (about 8.6% of the global ocean's surface area), with dissolution rates being a function of grain size, ambient seawater temperature, and pH. Our results indicate that for a large-enough olivine deployment of small-enough grain sizes (10 mu m), atmospheric CO2 could be reduced by more than 800 GtC by the year 2100. However, COA with coarse olivine grains (1000 mu m) has little CO2 sequestration potential on this time scale. Ambitious CDR with fine olivine grains would increase coastal aragonite saturation Omega to levels well beyond those that are currently observed. When imposing upper limits for aragonite saturation levels (Omega(lim)) in the grid boxes subject to COA (Omega(lim) = 3.4 and 9 chosen as examples), COA still has the potential to reduce atmospheric CO2 by 265 GtC (Omega(lim) = 3.4) to 790 GtC (Omega(lim) = 9) and increase ocean carbon storage by 290 Gt (Omega(lim) = 3.4) to 913 Gt (Omega(lim) = 9) by year 2100.",,,,,,,,,28,1,0,0,11,0,29,,,2328-4277,,,,,,,,,,,"GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Dept Biogeochem Modelling, Kiel, Germany",,,,2018-01-26,WOS:000422682700006,,

Few data concerning the weathering, provenance and tectonic setting of the Carboniferous sedimentary rocks in the Junggar Basin have been published. The recent discovery of an oil-gas field in the East Junggar Basin provides the impetus for this study. Twenty-eight sediment samples were recovered from eight boreholes, and all were analysed for major and trace element geochemistry. Two samples of sedimentary rocks were selected for zircon U-Pb dating. Low chemical index of alteration (CIA) values (44-71) and relatively high index of compositional variability (ICV) values (0.72-1.83) suggested weak chemical weathering and an immature source for these samples. The relatively low Th/U (2.16-10.55) and Rb/Sr (0.03-5.44) ratios of the drill core samples reflect a simple recycling history. Two samples indicated upper Carboniferous ages (314.6 Ma) and a lower-middle Devonian age (397.9 Ma). Geochemistry and detrital zircon geochronology from the East Junggar Basin reveal a distinct difference in the composition and source rock ages of clastic rocks from the lower and the upper Carboniferous. Major and trace element compositions of the lower Carboniferous sedimentary rocks (LCRs) were derived from typical mafic rocks and an intermediate ocean island arc of early to middle Devonian age, whereas the upper Carboniferous sedimentary rocks (UCRs) were derived from a continental island arc or active continental margin setting with a dominantly felsic to intermediate late Carboniferous age. The current data provide little support for tectonic models that show a passive continental margin of a Precambrian crystalline basement: our study suggests that a volcanic arc accretion or archipelago (early Carboniferous to early-middle Devonian) model for the East Junggar Basin is more viable.

By adding 79.6 mm year(-1)water in addition to the mean annual precipitation of 204.0 mm year(-1), irrigation leads to increases in evapotranspiration and runoff, accompanied by shallower groundwater table depths. Increases in crop productivity in response to irrigation result in more carbon storage in the watershed, and drastically large seasonal fluctuations in soil organic carbon in response to changes in soil temperature and moisture.

Delile calculated from seasonal rates of C gain (photosynthesis), C loss (respiration) and growth. We compare our balance with the evolution of seasonal C reserves in order to determine the parameters (shoot:root biomass, reserve allocation, photosynthetic parameters, etc.) that influence the seasonal cycle of the plant. Additionally, we examine whether the annual C balance can be used as a valid tool for testing the vulnerability of seagrasses to light reduction. The seasonal whole-plant C balance showed alternate negative (from September to June) and positive (July and August) values. This trend was the result of the interplay among several seasonal factors such as irradiance, water turbidity, photosynthetic parameters, respiratory rates, shoot growth, within-shoot age distribution, and principally, the low photosynthetic:non-photosynthetic biomass ratio. The lack of significant correlation between seasonal growth and metabolic balance (C gain - C demand) did not permit the prediction of plant growth. Conversely, the seasonal pattern of carbon storage was consistent with the periods of positive and negative C balance. Consequently, reserve mobilization allows over-wintering and re-growth under conditions of negative C balance. Using different calculations the annual C balance was found to be negative during 1993; this is in accordance with the carbohydrate interannual depletion and the shoot density decline. Since Posidonia oceanica is regressing in the Mediterranean, our carbon budget may notably contribute to future carbon models that can be essential tools for defining the minimum light requirements for survival. More insight into the functioning of some of the parameters that definitively influence this carbon budget (e.g.: the rhizome/root oxygen consumption and the O2 to C conversion) is needed to fully understand the vulnerability of seagrasses to light reduction.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0171-8630,,,,,,,,,,,"Centre d'Estudis Avancats de Blanes, CSIC, Cami de Santa Barbara s/n, 17300, Blanes, Girona, Spain",,,,2001-02-14,BCI:BCI200100542025,,

The water was similarly composed as sea water with a maximum salinity of 24.9 g/L, dominated by NaCl (15.6 g/L Cl and 7.8 g/L Na). Until the end of the tests, the water was affected by drilling mud as indicated by the high pH (8.9) and high bicarbonate concentration (359 mg/L) that both resulted from the impact of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) additives. The high amount of dissolved organic matter (> 58 mg/L) and its molecular-weight distribution pattern indicated that residues of cellulose, an ingredient of the drilling mud, were still present at the end of the tests. Clear evidence of this contamination gave the measured uranine that was added as a tracer into the drilling mud. During fluid production, the microbial community structure and abundance changed and correlated with the content of drilling mud. Eight taxa of sulfate-reducing bacteria, key organisms in processes like bio-corrosion and bio-clogging, were identified.

Given that more than half of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions typically come from stationary energy generation, most climate policy in Australia has focussed on electricity sector reform, particularly the uptake of variable renewable energy and the decrease of thermal power generation. Electricity supply in Australia has undergone substantial change over recent years, substantially due to these policies, and needs to continue changing in the future to meet climate change mitigation targets and ensure stable, costeffective electricity supply. This paper is therefore written from the perspective of an electricity planner and seeks to learn from the experiences of climate policies tried over recent decades. We start by reviewing the history of Australian energy policy and a description of how the Australian electricity network is structured to operate. We examine the theory and effects of different policies tried, which range from renewable energy targets, carbon pricing schemes, subsidies for renewable energy and research and development initiatives. We make three key observations from the case analysis: (1) that there has been substantial expense and effort effectively wasted through duplicate effects of different policy mechanisms by both federal and state governments; (2) as various mechanisms enable variable renewable energy generation to increase, the market becomes distorted, increasing total system costs and decreasing system robustness and resilience; and (3) the narrowed focus of climate policy mechanisms on certain variable renewables, such as solar photovoltaic and wind generation, omitted the opportunity for uptake of scale-able low carbon, firm generation options, like nuclear power and carbon capture and storage.",,,,,,,,,11,1,0,0,2,0,12,,,0301-4797,1095-8630,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaGamma Energy Technol, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaUniv Queensland, Ctr Nat Gas, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaRed Vector, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",Gamma Energy TechnolRed Vector,,,2020-12-29,WOS:000593972200005,32932067,

Gases that were not partially soluble in the melt, such as water and CO2, formed a thick, deep atmosphere surrounding the post-impact Earth. This atmosphere was opaque to thermal radiation, allowing heat to escape to space only at the runaway greenhouse threshold of approximately 100 W m(-2). The duration of this runaway greenhouse stage was limited to approximately 10 Myr by the internal energy and tidal heating, ending with a partially crystalline uppermost mantle and a solid deep mantle. At this point, the crust was able to cool efficiently and solidified at the surface. After the condensation of the water ocean, approximately 100 bar of CO2 remained in the atmosphere, creating a solar-heated greenhouse, while the surface cooled to approximately 500 K. Almost all this CO2 had to be sequestered by subduction into the mantle by 3.8 Ga, when the geological record indicates the presence of life and hence a habitable environment. The deep CO2 sequestration into the mantle could be explained by a rapid subduction of the old oceanic crust, such that the top of the crust would remain cold and retain its CO2. Kinematically, these episodes would be required to have both fast subduction (and hence seafloor spreading) and old crust. Hadean oceanic crust that formed from hot mantle would have been thicker than modern crust, and therefore only old crust underlain by cool mantle lithosphere could subduct. Once subduction started, the basaltic crust would turn into dense eclogite, increasing the rate of subduction. The rapid subduction would stop when the young partially frozen crust from the rapidly spreading ridge entered the subduction zone.",,,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,9,0,42,,,1364-503X,1471-2962,,,,,,,,,,"Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USANASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA",,,,2014-09-13,WOS:000340799400002,25114303,

At present, this understanding, generally constructed from grab samples, lacks detail. Dependent on sampling frequency, important periods of carbon export may remain undetected. Capturing detail, through high frequency in-situ measurement, will inform the calculation of accurate budgets of dissolved organic carbon export and provide insight into how the environment controls loss of carbon from the landscape. Such insights will offer societal and scientific advances in many ways, ranging from calculating how long for a windfarm takes to payback carbon expended in construction (construction may impact on terrestrial storage of carbon, later reflected in aquatic export), to incorporating rigourous models of how much carbon is transferred by rivers from land to sea, into global carbon cycle models. Accompanying development of the sensor to quantify DOC export will be contemporaneous characterisation of DOC composition by application of Raman spectroscopy. Should this approach prove viable, if time permits (ultimately dependent on student progress) the doctoral training programme will also explore development of field deployable sensors for logging of in-situ Raman spectra. On the short-term timescale (of this studentship), the research programme proposed will further our understanding of several NERC fundamental research priorities, namely, 'What are the sources, sinks and transportation processes of C within the earth system?', 'How is the carbon cycle influenced and integrated by other major biogeochemical cycles?', and thus is appropriate for NERC's key strategic and scientific priorities. However as the research programme will require training and expertise development across disciplines (biogeochemistry, statistical modelling and electronics), and this will be intellectually challenging, the longer term return from such NERC training investment is an intellectually flexible individual, positioned to address future emerging, inter-disciplinary research challenges. Indeed this doctoral training programme develops six of the fifteen key skills recently indentified as critical skill gaps for the environment sector (ERFF Report Number, Most Wanted Skill Needs in the Environment Sector), namely expertise in modelling (of time series), data management, numeracy, multi-disciplinarity, fieldwork and freshwater science.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/I019670/1,,,,,,,,University of Glasgow,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15339019,,

The dissolved oil components are expected to be the main driver for oil dispersion toxicity; however, very few studies have investigated the specific contribution of oil droplets to toxicity. In the present work, the contribution of oil micro-droplet toxicity in dispersions was isolated by comparing exposures to oil dispersions (water soluble fraction with droplets) to concurrent exposure to filtered dispersions (water-soluble fractions without droplets). Physical (coloration) and behavioral (feeding activity) as well as molecular (metabolite profiling) responses to oil exposures in the copepod Calanus finmarchicus were studied. At high dispersion concentrations (4.1-5.6 mg oil/L), copepods displayed carapace discoloration and reduced swimming activity. Reduced feeding activity, measured as algae uptake, gut filling and fecal pellet production, was evident also for lower concentrations (0.08 mg oil/L). Alterations in metabolic profiles were also observed following exposure to oil dispersions. The pattern of responses were similar between two comparable experiments with different oil types, suggesting responses to be non-oil type specific. Furthermore, oil micro-droplets appear to contribute to some of the observed effects triggering a starvation-type response, manifested as a reduction in metabolite (homarine, acetylcholine, creatine and lactate) concentrations in copepods. Our work clearly displays a relationship between crude oil micro-droplet exposure and reduced uptake of algae in copepods. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Six factors were identified as causing the contamination of groundwater in the Dammam aquifer depending on data availability and the opinions of experts. These factors were the distance to the Abu Jir fault, fault density, aquifer hydraulic conductivity and thickness, borehole depths, and elevation above mean sea level.

The ranked values from TOPSIS were classified into five contamination hazard zones: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high.

Introduction There has been a strong tendency to view pre-modern Korean culture exclusively as part of a larger East Asian culture encompassing China and Japan, tied together by Confucianism,Buddhism, and Chinese characters. This emphasis on Chinese culture is not surprising when we consider Korea's close relationship with China in the development of Korea's culture and history. Such a strong emphasis on China, however, has often resulted in a distorted view that overlooks the diverse cultures coexisting in the history of Asia.Asia is highly divergent both historically and geographically. Because race, language, and religion vary widely across regions, it is more difficult to develop a comprehensive view of Asian history and culture.Fortunately, the recent establishment of academic associations devoted to the study of Asian culture and history has led to the development of scholarships based on primary textual and archaeological sources recorded in the local language, bringing a more balanced view to the understanding of Asian culture.One of the most effective ways to present Asia's cultural diversity for the public would be to explain it through cultural artifacts that contain information about the history and culture in which they were produced. International relations have played a part in creating public knowledge alongside the increasing number of specialists from academic institutions. The reestablishment of diplomatic relations with the Democratic People's Republic of China and the post-Soviet states in Central Asia in the early 1990s brought about a renewed interest in the cultures of these regions. Public museums in Korea were able to establish relationships with Chinese museums and introduce the rich regional traditions of China, providing us with an opportunity to systematically study a wide array of regional cultures including those of Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Yunnan, Tibet, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.The recent opening of the Asian galleries at the National Museum of Korea, in conjunction with its new building in Yongsan, Seoul, in October 2005, expedited the process even further. The establishment of a separate department of Asian art reflected the museum's intention to display the diverse cultural interactions with surrounding cultures in Korean culture and history through permanent and special exhibitions. It would bring a more systematic understanding of the diverse cultural histories coexisting in Asia and a broader view of Korean culture in the context of cultural interactions.The new Asian galleries at the National Museum of Korea in Yongsan, mark the first specialized Asian galleries in the museum's history. It is also worth noting that specialists for each gallery were consulted well in advance to ensure efficient preparations for the opening.The Asian galleries include Central Asia, Japan, China, South and Southeast Asia, and the Sinan Shipwreck Collection.2. Asian Art Collections in Korea 1) The National Museum of Korea (1) The Central Asian Collection In the late 19th and early 20th centuries Central Asia became the arena for competition between western powers. Russia, Britain, Sweden, Germany and France all rushed to the region, sending out expeditions to collect information useful for political and military purposes.However, when ancient texts and artifacts of great academic value began to be excavated in the desert area of the Tarim Basin and came to be of academic value, the nature of the expeditions gradually changed to become academic researches on the region's geography and history.Otani Kozui, the 22nd Abbot of the Nishihonganji sect in Kyoto, was in London when the race to excavate in Central Asia began. On his way back to Japan, Otani personally explored western China, and later financed two archaeological expeditions to Central Asia. The research conducted by the Otani Expedition between 1902 and 1914 were published in detail in Illustrated Archaeological Study of the Western Regions (Seiiki Ko –ko Zufu, 1915). But because his expeditions were personally funded, unlike the government-sponsored Western expeditions,Otani soon found himself in the middle of a financial crisis and was forced to abdicate. This led the wide range of objects collected during Otani's expeditions to be scattered in different locations, even before they were labeled and studied.The artifacts that remained with Kozui during his exile in China were housed in Lushun Museum, Dalian, China. The rest were sent to the National Museum in Tokyo and the Joseon Government-General Museum in Seoul. The collection was given to the Joseon Government-General Museum in 1916 and continued to be on display at Sujeong-jeon in Gyeongbokgung Palace until Korea's independence. The Otani collection in Seoul consists of 2,000 objects,including wall paintings from cave temples, everyday objects from the oasis cultures in Central Asia, and burial objects. The museum managed to secure the collection safely during the Korean War.(2) Modern Japanese Art The National Museum of Korea has 198 Japanese modern art works that were collected during the Japanese occupation. They include 93 Japanese-style paintings, 37 western-style paintings, 4 prints, 20 sculptures, and 44 craft objects. In 1938 the Japanese colonial government moved the Yi Royal Household Museum in Changkyeonggung Palace to a newly built art museum building located in Deoksugung Palace. The Seokjo-jeon hall in Deoksugung Palace had been the venue for exhibitions of modern Japanese art since 1933; these were merged with the collections at the Yi Royal Household Museum to be housed in the new Yi Royal Household General Art Museum. Until Korea's independence in 1945, the Japanese colonial government strategically purchased and exhibited Japanese art in order to display the superiority of Japanese art to the Korean art world and audience.Like the Central Asian collection, these works of modern Japanese art stayed in the National Museum collection after the Japanese withdrew from Korea in 1945. Because most of the Japanese artworks housed in the National Museum were winners of major art competitions in Japan from the 1930s to the early 1940s, they include famous names from modern Japanese art history. They have been preserved remarkably well because strong anti-Japanese sentiments after the independence prevented these works from being displayed in public. The craft objects in particular are noteworthy because there are no contemporary craft objects in Japanese collections. These works are from the transitional period when Japanese artists were striving to incorporate the modern with the traditional; these works also serve as important time capsules for studying Japanese art history.(3) Sinan Shipwreck Collection The Silk Road played an important role as the path of trade and cultural transmissions across the Eurasian continent. The maritime Silk Road routes (sea route) compensated the land Silk Road routes (oasis route). The sea route is often called the Ceramic Road, as the development in shipbuilding and navigation technologies allowed large bulks of ceramic wares to be transported over the sea. Dynamic trade activities along the sea route from China to the Islamic empires in Western Asia extended even to Korea and Japan via Southeast Asia and the southeastern coast of China during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368).In 1323, an international trade vessel, loaded with various trade goods including ceramics, departed from the port of Ningbo in China. On its way to Kyoto, however, it sank in the coastal waters of Sinan, Jeollanamdo, Korea. In 1975, the discovery of a celadon vase by a local fisherman led to the ship's excavation.The excavation of the ship, now called Sinan-sun after its location, was the first underwater archaeology project to be executed in Korea. The discovery of the ship raised increased interest in the international exchanges that took place along the sea trade routes, and more underwater excavation projects were conducted near the Wando, Doripo, Biando, and Taeanbando islands in Korea. With the discovery of Sinan-sun, the sea trade routes in East Asia could now be understood in the larger framework of a pan-Asian network. The artifacts found in the ship provide important evidence for understanding the trade and everyday life along the maritime Silk Road.Underwater excavations were conducted eleven times during the period of nine years from 1976 to 1984. 22,000 ceramic and other objects, 28 tons of coins, 1,000 rosewood objects,and fragments of the ship were excavated. 60% of the ceramics were Longquan wares from the Zhejian Province in China, followed by those made in Jingdezhen, Cizhou, and Jun.(4) Kaneko Kazushige Collection The Southeast Asian collection was one of the National Museum's weakest collections. In accordance with the opening of the new building in 2005, however, the museum was able to acquire an important collection from Kaneko Kazushige, who donated to the museum 1,020objects he had collected in Asia for the past 40 years.Kaneko had spent all his life traveling in Asia, conducting researches and collecting works of various cultures. To prevent his collection from being dispersed and to ensure their conservation, researches and exhibitions, he decided to donate the entire collection to a single museum that could represent a nation; the National Museum of Korea was chosen.The objects in the Kaneko Kazushige collection can be traced to over 30 countries in East Asia, Central Asia, West Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. The wide range of objects include archaeological objects (prehistoric earthenware, bronze, and glass), Buddhist sculptures and paintings, texts, ritual objects, ceramics, lacquerware, woodwork, textiles, bamboo objects,clothing, everyday ceramics, toys, dolls, masks, and musical instruments.2) Private Museum Collection and Exhibition (1) The Tibetan Collection at Hwajung Museum The Tibetan thangka, or Buddhist painting, is commonly found in collections outside of Tibet because of its portability; during historical events that threatened the production of religious art, the Cultural Revolution for example, many paintings were taken out of China.Most of them ended up in European and North American collections, but Kwang-ho Hahn, the founder of the Hahn Cultural Foundation in Korea, became fascinated by Tibetan art after a chance encounter. Since then, he has devoted his life to collecting Tibetan art. The Hahn collection has been expanding every year; the number of objects belonging to the collection reached 900 objects in 2000, making it one of the strongest Tibetan art collections in the world.The Hahn collection includes mandalas, which were central to the practice of Tibetan Esoteric Buddhism, as well as images of Maitreya, Bodhisattva, Idam, Mahakala, Dharmapala, and Arhats, all valuable both in terms of history and iconography.The Tibetan objects from the Hahn collection are now housed in Hwajeong Museum,which is located in the northern part of Seoul in Pyeongchang-dong. Specialist curators are in charge of surveying and researching the collection, as well as planning the museum's annual public exhibitions on Tibetan art. Hwajeong Museum has also been actively engaged in publishing the collection, beginning with Art of Tibet, the museum's opening exhibition catalog published in 1999. The Art of Thangka, an annual report on the museum's collection, has reached its sixth volume (published in 2012) since its first publication in 1997. (The Art of Thangka from Hahn's Collection, vols. 1-6, Seoul: Hahn Cultural Foundation, 1991-2012).(2) Other Collection In addition to its excellent collection of Tibetan art, Hwajeong Museum houses works of calligraphy, paintings and ceramics from the Ming and Qing periods. The museum also holds a large collection of Ming and Qing decorative arts such as metalwork, ivory and wooden sculptures, lacquerware, and jade objects, providing important documents of everyday life and culture during the Ming and Qing periods (Chinese Art Collection of the Hahn Cultural Foundation, vols. 1-2, Seoul: Hahn Cultural Foundation, 2000).Yoogeum Museum, located in Jongno-gu Buam was opened in 2008 as one of the specialized museums that mainly collect Korean and Chinese ancient roof-end tiles. Yu Changjong and Kum Gi-sook's lifelong collection of 1,873 pieces of roof-end tiles and tile, from East Asia and Southeast Asia, was donated to the National Museum of Korea in September 2002. A special exhibition of Gift of Yu Chang-jong's roof-end tile and tile was held in December 2002 to honor the donators. 392 pieces were introduced, including 132 roof-end tiles from China and 21 from Japan and Southeast Asia.Indian Art Museum was opened in July1, 2011 by Kim Yang-sik, a poet and also a renowned researcher of Tagore. Thousands of pieces were collected including sculpture, crafts,and musical instrument, etc. In September 2012, as a celebration of museum's one year anniversary, The Gods of India was held as a special exhibition. In addition, the Indian Art Museum Collection of 180 representative pieces was published.Above this, Woodblock Prints Museum located in Chiak Mountain, Wonju, houses over 3500 antique pieces related to woodblock prints from Korea, China, Japan, and Tibet,Mongolia, India and Nepal. The museum holds various cultural events such as special exhibition and symposium.3. Asian Art Exhibitions in Korea As I have noted above, active scholarly and cultural interactions between the National Museum of Korea and other public museums, as well as between the National Museum and provincial museums in China, have taken place since Korea established diplomatic ties with China in 1992. This has led to many special exhibitions on varying themes from Chinese history and culture.These exhibitions have enabled us to focus on the regional diversities developed from the various cultural and natural climates in China, including the north, south, and the arid region of the northwest, and to better understand the diverse cultures and peoples that constitute Chinese culture.Similarly, the normalization of diplomatic relations with Russia and the new establishment of diplomatic ties with the former Soviet republics in Central Asia have led to more active cultural exchanges. Related exhibitions have opened at the National Museum of Korea, and a training program for specialists has been initiated in order to conserve and manage more effectively the archaeological sites and artifacts found along the Central Asian Silk Road.As the National Museum of Korea began to operate its newly established Asian galleries,collaborative exchanges with museums outside of Korea helped to compensate for the museum's relatively weak Southeast Asian collections and more effectively introduce Southeast Asian culture to the Korean audience. Art of Indonesia, the result of such collaborative efforts, was on view for two years after the opening of the new museum building in 2005 and provided an overview of Indonesian history and culture. The following exhibition Vietnam: Life and Culture was another collaborative project, and was on view from March 2008 to January 2010.The two exhibitions mentioned above can be seen as part of cultural exchange programs between nations. Other exhibitions of varying nature show the recent tendencies in Asian art exhibitions in Korea: while special exhibitions on certain cultural regions have concentrated on introducing each of the diverse cultures that have coexisted in Asia, some have taken a holistic approach, focusing on cultural interactions in Asia and the link between the East and West.Such proliferation of exhibitions focusing on the cultural interactions between the East and West can be seen as one of the recent efforts to overcome the side effects of studies or exhibitions based on a narrow understanding of Korean culture.4. Conclusion In 1990s, Korea established full-scale diplomatic relations with countries in communist bloc such as Russia and China, and at this point, specific cultural exchanges such as related exhibition of cultural property began to revitalize. It is true that within past 20 years these efforts left remarkable results. And around this point, collections on a specific topic or regional culture of Asia seem to begin in earnest before and after this point.In addition, in this period, our national power has risen rapidly which brought a time when we introduced collections from foreign, distinguished museums. And through this process, not only the objects from Asian museums, but also cultural properties taken out by the Western powers around the beginning of the 20th century were recognized.Part of such tendency is due to criticism on the Chinese-oriented academic imbalance in the domestic oriental studies, as well as Asian art history. Scholars of academy and museums have now begun to expand their interest to the historically and geographically diverse world of Asian cultures, which is also in following the wishes of general civilians. This has resulted in many Asian art-exhibitions, held under various topics, helping to shed light on the colorful world of Asian cultures, people, and religion.Moreover, these special exhibitions of Asian art, held in cooperation with various Asian countries, have naturally contributed in increasing the number of international exhibitions of our own cultural heritage. This has opened new doors for cultural exchange and some attempts at bilateral exhibitions based on a full-scale exchange. One collateral benefit was that, through exchange of personnel and academic data among professionals, we have also been successful in creating people's network with the other Asian countries.Recently, curators from not only the best museums in Asia but also from those in South America and East European countries are actively approaching us with proposals for bilateral exhibitions. Some of the representative museums in the west are planning large-scale exhibitions of Korean art and some are asking for our assistance in renovating their existing Korean collection for a more effective exhibition.However, with all the short-term success we have enjoyed so far, there are still many problems left to be solved, including bettering collection quality and incorporating more diversity in special exhibitions. It is true that Koreans are holding a prejudice against Islams in all fields, including education and mass communication. In fact, few attempts are made today in order to systematically understand the Islamic cultures.Therefore, in order to establish a systematic understanding of the local cultures, including those of west, South Asia and the northern nomadic tribes, we need to be more active in promoting cultural exchange with these regions through exhibition events. In addition, we need to nurture more specialists on these regions and actively build research archives based on joint investigations. More emphasis should be laid in holding special exhibitions which reflect research results based on such fundamental studies.We, in our present situation, are bound by cultural prejudices and our Asian art collection may provide a solution to overcome our narrow views on culture. However, our collection is still too heavily focused on a few local areas. Another problem is that the level of quality of our collection is far from being balanced.Studying and appreciating Asian arts offers not only a key to understanding the various forms of life and culture of these people but also an important chance to grossly re-estimate our own culture.Recently it is becoming increasingly difficult to approach foreign cultural artifacts.Therefore it is especially important that we build a system which can systematically collect cultural artifacts from all Asian cultures, introduce these relics to the public, and raise professional researchers specializing in these particular regions.If we maintained our present reckless course, collecting relics and promoting exchange with a short-sighted and careless manner, conducting shallow research, and neglecting the importance of raising experts, we have little hope in gaining a solid result from our exhibitions and cultural exchange with the Asian countries. It would be even more difficult to build any reliable museums specializing in Asian culture, such as museum of Asian anthropology.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0540-4568,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012-01-01,KJD:ART001718998,,

Various alloys and metals have been long explored for use as electrode materials in different media. Stainless steel (SS 304) electrodes are cost effective and have a large surface area; further their catalytic performance is comparable to that of carbon coated noble metals cathodes. Stainless steel has good mechanical properties and durability so it is widely used in desalination plants, oil and gas industries, ship building, etc. However, over a period of time it corrodes very quickly in saline water. To improve the stability and durability of the electrodes (i.e., to minimize corrosion), we anneal the samples under two different sets of conditions and test the electrodes in 3.5% NaCl solution. The anodic peak ( - 0.25 V) observed for bare stainless steel result from the formation of iron (II) hydroxide [Fe(OH)(2)]. The Raman bands observed at 210 and 274 cm(-1) for bare stainless steel result from the formation of alpha-Fe2O3 owing to partial, anodic, and cathodic reactions occurring on the electrode which disrupts the surface layers. High intensity X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman peaks of Cr2O3 and MnCr2O4 observed in argon and hydrogen annealed sample after cyclic voltammetry reveal that this sample is more stable than bare and air annealed samples. XRD reveals mixed oxide phases in addition to eskolaite and magnetite phases. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show that although the air-annealed sample has a soft, spongy structure, Na and Cl ions are adsorbed in the voids on the outer surface of the electrode leading to quick degradation. For the air-annealed sample the oxide appears to adhere poorly to the stainless steel. Oxygen (ie., oxide composition) may play a key role in adherence and growth of Cr2O3 formed at high temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that large amounts of Cr and Mn are dissolved/corroded into the electrolyte for air annealed sample which is in good agreement with the Raman and SEM results.",,,,,,,,,13,2,0,0,0,0,16,,,0013-9351,1096-0953,,,,,,,,,,"Inha Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Incheon 22212, South KoreaUniv Seoul, Sch Environm Engn, Seoul 02504, South Korea",,,,2019-06-14,WOS:000469162200057,31004909,

Hence, interest in developing new approaches and/or improving existing oil spill response measures has increased greatly in the past decade. Solidifiers are an attractive and underutilized option to mitigate the effects of oil spills, as they interact with oil to contain the spill, prevent it from spreading, and facilitate its removal from the environment. In this work, we have synthesized an inexpensive and easy-to-make natural-based sorbent, a subclass of solidifiers. Our amylopectin-graft-poly(methyl acrylate) (AP-g-PMA) sorbent is highly oleophilic and hydrophobic, and selectively solidifies diluted bitumen and conventional crude oil from biphasic mixtures of oil and water. The complete solidification of conventional crude oil and diluted bitumen by the AP-g-PMA sorbent occurs within 8 and 32 min, respectively, and even a low solidifier-to-oil ratio of 4% wow is sufficient to enable complete recovery of diluted bitumen. This innovative natural-based polymeric sorbent may be applied as a key component of oil spill response procedures, especially for heavy oils. The AP-g-PMA sorbent combines the biodegradability and non-toxicity of the amylopectin with the hydrophobicity and oleophilicity of the synthetic polymer poly(methyl acrylate).

To further enhance hydrophobicity and absorption capacity of oil, PEI/RGO PU-DW sponge is further coated with 20% phenyltrimethoxysilane (PTMOS). The PTMOS/PEI/RGO PU-DW sponge absorbs various oils within 20 s, with maximum absorption capacity values of 880% and 840% for bicycle chain oil and motorcycle engine oil, respectively.

A high-resolution unstructured grid was constructed to represent the narrow channels in the tidal estuary. The model was calibrated and verified with available hydrographic and water quality data measured in 2011. The overall performance of the model is in reasonable agreement with the measured water level, salinity, and water quality state variables. The model was then used to investigate the changes in salt water intrusion and water quality as a result of weir construction under low-flow conditions. The model simulations indicate that more tidal energy will propagate into the estuary after weir construction because of decreased freshwater discharges. The limits of salt water intrusion before and after weir construction coincide at a distance of 11.6 km from the mouth of the Wu River. This salt water intrusion limit is the reason that the Dadu Weir will be constructed at a distance of 12 km from the mouth of the Wu River. The weir will become a barrier to salt water intrusion. The simulation results indicate that the concentrations of dissolved oxygen and nutrients will decrease slightly after weir construction, while the chlorophyll a concentration in the middle reach will increase after weir construction.

The criteria are seen as absolute in the sense that measures need to be implemented if the criteria are not met. In Norway the petroleum regulations state that the operator has a duty to formulate risk acceptance criteria relating to major accidents and to the environment. This practice is in line with the internal control principle, which states that the operator has the full responsibility for identifying the hazards and seeing that they are controlled. In this paper we discuss the rationale for this practice. The expected utility theory, which is the backbone for all economic thinking, is used as a basis for the discussion. We show that if risk acceptance criteria are to be introduced as a risk management tool, they should be formulated by the authorities, as is the common scheme seen in many countries and industries, for example in the UK. Risk acceptance criteria formulated by the industry would not in general serve the interest of the society as a whole. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Experiments were conducted with South Louisiana crude oil contaminated salt water, limestone and quartz sand. Although the oil removal efficiency increased with the increasing amount of granular material applied, it did not increase linearly.

As part of this reform, it is expected that extraction of oil and gas via hydraulic fracturing will increase in five shale basins (e.g. Burgos, Sabinas, Tampico, Tuxpan, and Veracruz). Because hydraulic fracturing is a water-intensive activity, it is relevant to assess the potential water availability for this activity in Mexico. This research aims to quantify the water availability for hydraulic fracturing in Mexico and identify its spatial distribution along the five shale basins. The methodology consisted of a multilayer geospatial analysis that overlays the water availability in the watersheds and aquifers with the different types of shale resources areas (e.g. oil and associated gas, wet gas and condensate, and dry gas) in the five shale basins. The aquifers and watersheds in Mexico are classified in four zones depending on average annual water availability. Three scenarios were examined based on different impact level on watersheds and aquifers from hydraulic fracturing. For the most conservative scenario analyzed, the results showed that the water available could be used to extract between 8.15 and 70.42 Quadrillion British thermal units (Quads) of energy in the typical 20-30 year lifetime of the hydraulic fracturing wells that could be supplied with the annual water availability overlaying the shale areas, with an average across estimates of around 18.05 Quads. However, geographic variation in water availability could represent a challenge for extracting the shale reserves. Most of the water available is located closer to the Gulf of Mexico, but the areas with the larger recoverable shale reserves coincide with less water availability in Northern Mexico. New water management techniques (such as recycling and re-use), more efficient fracturing methods, shifts in usage patterns, or other water sources need to be identified to allocate water for hydraulic fracturing without affecting current users (e.g. municipal, irrigation, industrial, and environmental flows).",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,0,7,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 301 E Dean Keeton St Stop C1786, Austin, TX 78712 USAUniv Texas Austin, Dept Mech Engn, 204 E Dean Keeton St Stop C2200, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,,2017-08-17,WOS:000406842800003,,

Historical soil carbon depletion resulting from soil and land management offers an opportunity to store additional carbon to offset greenhouse gas emissions as part of our international response to climate change. However, our ability to reliably measure, estimate and predict soil carbon storage is hindered by a range of sources of variability, not least of which is change through time. In the present study, we assessed temporal changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and its component fractions in response to climate alone and in the absence of land use change at any given site by examining a series of soil monitoring sites across a basalt landscape in north-west New South Wales under a range of land use types over a 3-year period (March-April 2008 and March-April 2011), where a significant rainfall event had occurred in the intervening time (2010). Across the dataset, woodland soils contained the largest carbon concentration (SOC%) and total organic carbon stock (TOCs) compared with other non-wooded land use systems, which themselves were statistically similar. However, larger carbon quantities were restricted largely to the surface (0-10 cm) soil layers. Between 2008 and 2011, significant increases in SOC% and TOCs were detected, but again these were restricted to the woodland sites. No change in particulate organic carbon (POC) was detected between the two sampling times, but both humic organic carbon (HOC) and resistant organic carbon (ROC) increased in woodland soils between the two sampling times. Increased HOC we attribute to microbial processing of soil carbon following the 2010-11 rainfall event. However, we suggest that increased ROC results from limitations in mid-infrared calibration datasets and estimations. We conclude that the quantity of soil carbon and its component fractions is, indeed, driven by climatic factors, but that these effects are moderated by aboveground land use and SOC inputs.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,0,8,,,1838-675X,1838-6768,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, AustraliaNSW Off Environm & Heritage, Armidale, NSW 2351, AustraliaNSW Off Environm & Heritage, Soil Hlth & Arch, YAI PMB, Yanco, NSW 2703, Australia",,,,2017-06-06,WOS:000401801800007,,

Then, the ODA was grafted onto the cotton fabric through Schiff base reaction with o-quinone formed by oxidation of the catechol structure of PDA, which covered the surface of PDA coated cotton fabric. The superhydrophobic cotton fabric with contact angle up to 163.7 degrees and scroll angle around 9 degrees was obtained. Due to the excellent adhesion of polydopamine, the superhydrophobic cotton fabric demonstrated great stability and durability under a variety of harsh environmental conditions. After coating the polyurethane (PU) sponge with the prepared superhydrophobic cotton fabric, an oil absorbing bag was made and it showed good oil-water separation even after being reused 20 times, and the prepared cotton fabric also had excellent self-cleaning performance.

At oil-contaminated sites, PAH-degrading bacteria perform a critical role in the degradation and ultimate removal of these compounds. In April 2010, enormous quantities of PAHs entered the Gulf of Mexico from the thousands of tons of oil that were released from the ill-fated drilling rig Deepwater Horizon. In the ensuing months after the spill, intense research efforts were devoted to characterizing the microorganisms responsible for degrading the oil, particularly in deep waters where a large oil plume, enriched with aliphatic and low molecular-weight aromatic hydrocarbons, was found in the range of 1,000-1,300 m.

There is increasing evidence, however, that it may be necessary to go a step further by removing CO2 already emitted. For the purpose of carbon dioxide removal (CDR), a number of negative emissions technologies (NET) have been proposed. These generally make extensive usage of land, energy and water - if they are to be implemented at the large scales needed. It is therefore important to seek, investigate and compare alternative approaches to NET. Desalination plants, though normally seen as sources rather than sinks of CO2, could be modified to provide a new type of NET. In this study, we propose treating desalination reject brine by electrolysis to form Mg(OH)(2) and thus absorb CO2 via the oceans. The energy and water penalties associated with the electrolysis are calculated as 1.8 GJ per tCO(2) and 13.7 m(3) per tCO(2) respectively, making it an interesting option in comparison with some other types of NET. However, NET-modification more than doubles the specific energy consumption of a reverse-osmosis desalination plant.

In this Australian case study, we analyse a suite of 74 mitigation measures ranked as highest priority by one influential analysis, and we find that they have highly variable consequences for water quantity. We find: (1) The largest impacts result from land-based sequestration, which has the potential to intercept large quantities of water and reduce catchment yields, estimated to exceed 100 Mm(3)/MtCO(2)-e of carbon mitigated (100,000 l per tonne CO2-e). (2) Moderate impacts result from some renewable power options, including solar thermal power with a water cost estimated at nearly 4 Mm(3)/MtCO(2)-e. However, the water impacts of solar thermal power facilities could be reduced by designing them to use existing power-related water supplies or to use air or salt-water cooling. (3) Wind power, biogas, solar photovoltaics, energy efficiency and operational improvements to existing power sources can reduce water demand through offsetting the water used to cool thermal power generation, with minor savings estimated at 2 Mm(3)/MtCO(2)-e and amounting to nearly 100 Mm(3) of water saved in Australia per annum in 2020.

To assess the potential biophysical effects of afforestation, a set of extreme experiments in an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, the McGill Paleoclimate Model-2 (MPM-2), is designed. Model results show that latitudinal afforestation not only has a local warming effect but also induces global and remote warming over regions beyond the forcing originating areas. Precipitation increases in the northern hemisphere and decreases in southern hemisphere in response to afforestation. The local surface warming over the forcing originating areas in northern hemisphere is driven by decreases in surface albedo and increases in precipitation. The remote surface warming in southern hemisphere is induced by decreases in surface albedo and precipitation. The results suggest that the potential impact of afforestation on regional and global climate depended critically on the location of the forest expansion. That is, afforestation in 0 degrees-15 degrees N leaves a relatively minor impact on global and regional temperature; afforestation in 45 degrees-60 degrees N results in a significant global warming, while afforestation in 30 degrees-45 degrees N results in a prominent regional warming. In addition, the afforestation leads to a decrease in annual mean meridional oceanic heat transport with a maximum decrease in forest expansion of 30 degrees-45 degrees N. These results can help to compare afforestation effects and find areas where afforestation mitigates climate change most effectively combined with its carbon drawdown effects.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,5,0,10,,,0177-798X,1434-4483,,,,,,,,,,"Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Civil Aviat, Nanjing 210016, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm East Asia, Beijing 10029, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R ChinaBritish Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England",,,,2014-11-01,WOS:000344813300012,,

The prime mover exhaust thermal power is recovered using a bottoming organic Rankine cycle (ORC), with four working fluids used in commercial ORC systems evaluated. The performance of the poly-generation system is assessed both on a yearly and a seasonal basis. The octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM) cycle yields 6 MW of net power output at ideal and overall exhaust gas heat recovery efficiencies of 14% and 10%, respectively, 37 MW of process heat, and 1380 m(3)/hour of permeate. The reverse osmosis unit operates at a specific energy consumption and exergy efficiency of 4.1 kWh/m(3) and 29%, respectively. The exergetic efficiency of the poly-generation system is estimated at 32%, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the original gas turbine power generation system by 6%.

The study covers the energy consumption and environmental impacts of raw materials and processes during particleboard production. In order to identify the main hotspots and characterize the production process, impact categories were considered using CML methodology and cumulative exergy dethand (CExD) indicator. The results revealed that the board shaping subsystem was the main contributor to the most of impact categories.The main hotspot for resin production was known as Urea-formaldehyde (UF). Electricity was the main hotspot in acidification (AC) and ozone layer depletion (OLD) impact categories, while transportation and production process were the main hotspots in marine aquatic ecotoxicity (ME) and photochemical oxidation (PO) impact categories, respectively. Moreover, rotary dryer, hot press, flaker and hammer mill, vacuum pump and diesel fuel were the most effective sectors in the emissions of the production process. Results for substitution of natural gas showed that, except some impact categories, the use of alternative source of thermal energy such as wood residues could improve emissions from the manufacturing process.

The input and output data were collected directly from the farmers by way of questionnaires.The results indicated that the total GHG emissions from the analysed farms, with biological allocation, were: 1.47, 1.35, 1.49 and 1.50 kg CO2 eq. kg(-1) FPCM (Fat Protein Corrected Milk) for farm A, B, C and D respectively.

These reductions were mostly due to the GHG emissions associated to the LUC from imported soybean meal, while the contribution of SOC sequestration to the total GHG emissions was found to be negligible.When LUC emissions from imported soybean meal were not included in the analysis, lower GHG emissions were associated to higher milk yield, feed self-sufficiency and feed efficiency. However, when LUC emissions were included in the analysis, the highest level of these parameters did not always lead to a reduction of the total GHG emissions because the higher use of maize silage was associated with an increase in the use of imported soymeal.The results of this LCA also indicated that marine eutrophication, freshwater eutrophication, nonrenewable energy use, land occupation and total biodiversity loss decreased as the level of intensification of the production system increased. Conversely, local biodiversity loss, instead, increased if the milk yield per cow increased. We can conclude that, in the specific context analysed, the increase in productivity may lead to a trade-off between global impacts (such as GHG emissions) and local impacts (e.g. local biodiversity and eutrophication).

J,,,,,,,,,,,CO2 - H2 Optimisation in Rocks for Underground Storage (CHORUS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 1800,1800,"The UK is poised to embrace net zero carbon emission technologies to meet its Paris agreement targets, including offshore gas storage associated with the hydrogen (H2) fuel economy and Carbon Capture Usage and Storage (CCUS) schemes. Underground H2 storage (UHS) implies cyclic injection/depletion activities to deal with seasonal fluctuations associated with energy demands. For the cycle to be successful, a cushion gas is needed to keep the reservoir pressurised, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being a promising environmentally friendly alternative. In most storage projects, reservoir fluids are seismically monitored by associating the variation of seismic amplitude with fluid content. However, if H2 is injected in CO2-cushioned reservoir, several factors obscure the H2 seismic visibility: both H2 and CO2 have similar acoustic properties, and they have short timescales to settle within an injection/extraction cycle, often imbibing the rock in patches and lowering effective fluid mobility. In CHORUS we propose to address these issues by testing the hypothesis that a viscosity contrast is the key to seismic H2 detectability. We propose to test this hypothesis in three stages using our current expertise with dispersive wave propagation. First, we will perform ultrasonic laboratory measurements of elastic properties of reservoir rocks saturated with fluids expected to be found in UHS applications. Second, we will apply existing rock physics models established for CCUS to calculate the seismic velocities, attenuation and dispersion of reservoir rocks under different saturation conditions involving reservoir rocks saturated with H2-water and CO2-water below a caprock seal and calibrate these models using laboratory measurements. Third, we will identify how these finds scale up by calculating synthetic seismic data corresponding to a vertical seismic profile time-lapse experiment. Using this synthetic dataset, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis in order to understand the limits of seismic detectability of H2. Outcomes of this proposal have the potential to be used to de-risk the injection process by enhancing our ability to quantify H2 through better seismic resolution of the H2-CO2 interface. They can be used to inform policy-makers by identifying proxies for leakage risk and facilitate the planning of injection and monitoring strategies for industrial seasonal UHS. The methodology can be further used to asses caprock integrity by incorporating geomechanical effects from fracturing on the synthetic seismic signatures, a direction that we intend to explore in further research. We propose to disseminate our results in the form of two (six monthly) reports, a collaborative scientific publication in a lead academic journal, a collaborative conference publication and openly accessible data from the rock physics experiment and the synthetic seismic experiment. Using this project as springboard proof-of-concept, we intend to consolidate its finds by pursuing a long-term UK collaboration through a NERC Pushing Frontiers funding proposal. Such a proposal would incorporate fundamental research, as well as detailed anisotropic modelling of fractured top-seal/reservoir and seismic data. In addition, our theoretical advancements can add value to ongoing studies associated with UHS, both in NOC (NERC MOET), and UoE (EPSRC HyStorPore) by complementing them with rock physical knowledge.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/X013057/1,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:16296122,,

The accuracy of the model is evaluated by comparing it with results of previous studies. The sensitivity of various parameters on each subsystem is analysed, and the relationship between the mass flow and the parallel system is discussed. After determining the optimum operating conditions, the thermodynamic and economic performance of each subsystem and the combined system are analysed. The results indicate that the initial investment cost of the combined system can be recovered in 6.976 years. The fuel savings and reduction in carbon dioxide emissions are 38.55 kg/h and 52.08 kg/h, which proves that the proposed system can achieve excellent economic performance and emission reductions. Compared with the original engine, the net power production and thermal efficiency of the proposed system are 214.5 kW and 5.14% higher.

Significantly, multicomponent adsorption experiments, infrared spectroscopy, magic angle spinning solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and van der Waals-corrected density functional theory studies suggest that water enhances CO2 capture in 2-ampd-Mg2(dobpdc) through hydrogen-bonding interactions with the carbamate groups of the ammonium carbamate chains formed upon CO2 adsorption, thereby increasing the thermodynamic driving force for CO2 binding. In light of the exceptional thermal and oxidative stability of 2-ampd-Mg2(dobpdc), its high CO2 adsorption capacity, and its high CO2 capture rate from a simulated natural gas flue emission stream, this material is one of the most promising adsorbents to date for this important separation.

The paper identifies a number of existing policies from four key areas - energy/transport, agriculture, sub-soil, and oceans - which will have an impact on three NETs: Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), Direct Air Capture (DAC), and terrestrial Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW). We propose that non-climate co-benefits may be valuable in terms of the policy 'demand pull' for NETs; in particular, we find that ERW may provide multiple co-benefits which can be mandated through existing policy structures. However, interaction with numerous policy areas may also create barriers, particularly where there is tension between the priorities of different government departments. On the basis of existing and analogous policies from a range of geographical contexts and scales, this paper proposes four options for NETs policy that could be reasonably implemented in the near-term. We also argue that ERW demonstrates the importance of scale and framing, because the policy environment depends on whether it is framed as a soil amendment at local scales or as a climate stabilization technique at international scale. Key policy insights Co-benefits may assist the 'demand pull' for novel technologies by providing multiple policy angles for incentivisation rather than relying on a 'fix-all' policy such as a high carbon price. DAC with storage might be overly reliant on a high carbon price, because it only provides one core benefit - that of atmospheric carbon reduction. ERW may provide multiple co-benefits which can be mandated through existing policy structures, but should focus on using waste rock rather than mining virgin material. We propose four near-term options for NETs policy: funding for small-scale BECCS demonstration and an international biomass certification mechanism; small-scale loans for ERW on farms and promotion of locally-sourced rock residues; amendment of fertilizer subsidy schemes to include silicate rock; and a clearer framework for licensing sub-soil access for CO2 storage.",,,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,1,0,37,,,1469-3062,1752-7457,,,,,,,,,,"Cardiff Univ, Understanding Risk Grp, Dept Psychol, Cardiff, S Glam, WalesOpen Univ, Sch Environm Earth & Ecosyst Sci, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England",,,,2019-07-24,WOS:000475250100001,,

Cost/emission estimates, which determine the efficacy of compliance options, rely heavily on bottom-up methodologies for estimating fuel consumptions. These methodologies employ representative databases for their estimates instead of actual in-situ data. The use of in-situ data is therefore of paramount importance for accuracy of end results on which industry-wide strategic decisions are based.Moreover, total fuel consumption of a potential alternative is calculated simply using energy conversion factors in comparison to a conventional fuel. However, each compliance-option comprises of unique process-components which demand diverse operational, electrical and heating energy requirements which in turn alter their fuel consumptions and emission inventories. Therefore, each compliance-pathway should be assessed individually using in-situ data in order to estimate fuel consumptions and emission inventories rather than using energy conversion factors between them.A case study which utilizes in-situ data is conducted to assess the effect of fuel-specific processes on energy/operational demand and the emission estimates between residual heavy fuel-oils and liquefied natural-gas for a bulk carrier. The findings reveal that allocation and apportion of fuel-specific electrical/heating energy demands as well as operational components to each compliance option would produce more accurate emission estimates as well as realistic cost comparisons.

The ability of these inhibitors to reduce both the electrochemical corrosion reactions and the mechanical damage attributed to particle impingement is well documented, but the underlying mechanisms have been the subject of less attention. This paper presents a review of three commercially available oilfield corrosion inhibitors (two standard corrosion inhibitors and one high shear-resistant inhibitor) in an effort to establish their performance in erosion-corrosion environments. Experiments were conducted at 45 degrees C using a submerged impinging jet in carbon dioxide (CO2)-saturated conditions with a fluid velocity of 14 m/s and sand loading of 500 mg/L. A combination of gravimetric measurements, in situ electrochemistry, and surface profilometry allowed the inhibitors to be assessed based on a number of different parameters (i.e., mass loss, in situ corrosion behavior, and total penetration depth). The results demonstrate the importance of surface analysis techniques when evaluating the performance of inhibitors in erosion-corrosion environments, indicating that mass loss and in situ electrochemical techniques alone can sometimes provide misleading information in relation to their performance. The inhibitors are evaluated in erosion-corrosion environments where no semi-protective corrosion product formation occurs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements are incorporated into the analysis to assist in interpreting inhibition mechanisms and to help determine how inhibitors may be capable of reducing both the erosion and corrosion components of material loss.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,0010-9312,1938-159X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Leeds, Inst Funct Surfaces, Sch Mech Engn, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, EnglandWood Grp Integr Management Compass Point, Staines TW18 1DT, Middx, EnglandShell UK Ltd, Aberdeen AB12 3FY, Scotland",Wood Grp Integr Management Compass Point,,,2015-02-26,WOS:000348308500003,,

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined against 8 antimicrobials. PCR determined the presence of 16S rRNA, nuc, mecA, czrC, qacA/B, pvl, and toxin genes in S. aureus isolates. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), SCCmec, spa-, and agr-typing and serotyping determined the diversity among them.

Fatigue damage arises from stress changes in a structure due to cyclic loading. In practice, the lateral cyclic soil response is typically modelled using Winkler p-y springs. An appropriate soil model for conductor-soil interaction analysis is the one based on which the absolute magnitudes of stresses and their changes can accurately be predicted for well integrity evaluation. The API recommendations for p-y curves, which are often used for conductor-soil interaction analysis, have originally been developed for piled foundation and are inappropriate for well fatigue analysis. To that end, an extensive study involving four series of centrifuge model tests and FE numerical analyses was conducted to fundamentally study conductor-soil interaction under a wide spectrum of loading conditions. The tests simulated conductor installations in normally to over consolidated clays, and medium-dense clean sands. Soil models were developed specifically for conductor fatigue analysis for each of the soil types. The test results and soil models are presented in two papers. The first paper, Part I, presents an overview of the study and first series tests in normally to lightly over-consolidated kaolin clay and discusses the observations made with regards to monotonic and cyclic soil resistances and their relationship to conductor fatigue modelling. The second paper, Part II, presents centrifuge test results in normally to lightly over-consolidated Golf of Mexico (GoM) clay, over-consolidated natural clay and medium-dense clean sands along with the respective soil models developed for conductor fatigue damage prediction. Overall, the accuracy of fatigue life predictions using these novel soil models is very high - generally within about a few percentage of the measured values. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

While natural gas (NG) combustion produces substantially less soot than other fossil fuels, its soot emissions are not negligible and have not been morphologically characterized. In this study, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to interpret scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) distributions of catalytically-denuded particulate matter (soot) from an NG-powered commercial vessel. The vessel studied was powered by a dual-fuel compression ignition engine which uses a diesel pilot only to ignite the NG. Less than 2% of the engine's power is provided by the diesel pilot for engine loads above 50%. For comparison, tests were also run in diesel-only mode. During NG operation, the SMPS size distributions did not follow a lognormal distribution as expected. Instead, the distribution remained roughly constant from 10 nm to 100 nm. High resolution (HR)-TEM revealed particles as small as 30 nm in diameter were soot. From the TEM images, soot primary particle size and projected-area-equivalent diameter were estimated for individual soot particles. These data were then used to infer the effective density of the particles collected. In general, the primary particle size and correspondingly the estimated effective density of soot from this engine were larger than those from the universal fit proposed for soot in previous literature. For both operating conditions the source of the soot was likely the diesel pilot however, there were statistically significant differences between particles produced by the two fuelling modes. With LNG fueling, there were far fewer particles, and mean soot aggregate size decreased, but the primary particle size (for a 100 nm aggregate) increased, relative to diesel. Engine load did not have a statistically significant effect on soot morphology.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,4,0,20,,,0021-8502,1879-1964,,,,,,,,,,"Univ British Columbia, Dept Mech Engn, Vancouver, BC, CanadaNatl Res Council Canada, Metrol Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON, CanadaUniv Calif Riverside, Bourns Coll Engn, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",,,,2019-11-18,WOS:000493892200004,,

Actual navigation data of a vessel were collected to determine its fuel consumption, and an LNG fuel tank was designed based on the data. To observe the FGS system's thermodynamic state and condition according to its operation, a dynamic process simulation was conducted. Fire risk assessments were made through fire frequency analysis and consequence analysis on the FGS system's operating conditions. An event tree for a fire accident was compiled, and the leak frequency and ignition probability for each system were obtained. The release rates due to leakage were obtained, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were used for consequence analysis. Fire exceedance curves for heat doses were generated by combining the results of frequency and consequence analyses. The cumulative frequency was found to be higher in the Pump FGS for the same heat dose.

Don in New Zealand has led to the establishment of over 600 000 ha of new plantation forests, about 85% of which are on fertile pastures used previously for grazing sheep and cattle. While this leads to rapid accumulation of carbon ( C) in vegetation, the effects of afforestation on soil C are poorly understood. We examined key soil C cycling processes at the ( former) Tikitere agroforestry experimental site near Rotorua, New Zealand. In 1973, replicated stands of P. radiata ( 100 and 400 stems/ha) were established on pastures, while replicated pasture plots were maintained throughout the first 26-year rotation. In 1996, soil C and microbial biomass C in 0 - 0.10 m depth soil, in situ soil respiration and net N mineralisation, and soil temperature were lower in the forest than in the pasture, and tended to decline with increasing tree-stocking density. In the 400 stems/ha stands, mineral soil C ( 0 - 0.50m depth) was lower than in the pasture ( 104 and 126 Mg C/ha, respectively; P< 0.01). Carbon accumulation in the forest floor during the first rotation of these forest stands was 12 Mg C/ha. Using the Rothamsted soil C model (Roth-C), we examined how changes in plant C inputs following afforestation might lead to changes in soil C content to 0.30 m depth. Steady-state pasture inputs of 9.0 Mg C/ha. year were estimated using Roth-C; these C inputs were assumed to decrease linearly during the first 12 years following tree establishment ( until canopy closure). Below-ground C inputs in the forest were estimated using steady-state relationships between litterfall and soil respiration; these inputs were assumed to increase linearly between years 1 and 12, after which they remained constant at 1.53 Mg C/ha. year until harvest. Measured changes in soil C (0-0.30 m) during the first rotation, in conjunction with the below-ground inputs, were used to estimate above-ground inputs ( as a proportion of total litterfall [3.81 Mg C/ha. year]) to the soil. Our results suggest 10% of litterfall C over one rotation actually entered the mineral soil. Using these results and estimates of additional C inputs to the soil from harvest slash and weeds following harvest, we found mineral-soil C stocks would continue to decline during second and third rotations of P. radiata; the magnitude of this decline depended in part on how much slash enters the mineral soil matrix. We confirmed our modelling approach by simulating soil C changes to within 8% over 19 years following afforestation of pasture at another previously studied site, Purukohukohu. Whether afforestation leads to an increase or decrease in mineral-soil C may depend on previous pasture management; in highly productive pastures, high C inputs to the soil may maintain soil C at levels that cannot be sustained when trees are planted onto these grasslands.",,,,,,,,,35,3,0,0,30,0,40,,,0004-9573,1446-568X,,,,,,,,,,"Landcare Res, Palmerston North, New Zealand",,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000236254700001,,

The results of eight rounds of monitoring the groundwater chemistry over the years 2012-2015 have been assessed, based mainly on the presence of organic matter derived from petroleum hydrocarbons and on the total dissolved solids content of groundwater. Good correlations between these two parameters suggest that there is simultaneous movement of hydrocarbons and salts that are leached from the surface soil by the infiltration of surface runoff. It has been concluded that although these parameters have shown some periodical fluctuations in their values, there has been no significant change in the overall extent and severity of groundwater contamination over the period of the study. The fluctuations observed are possibly the results of seasonal addition of pollutants that are carried downwards by the infiltration of rainfall; the effects of biogeochemical reactions within the aquifer; and the movement of pollutants with groundwater flow and dilution by mixing with unpolluted groundwater within the aquifer.

Current proposals from major oil and gas transportation companies include numerous large diameter pipelines across the Rocky Mountains to port locations on the coast of British Columbia (BC), Canada. The large scale of these projects and the rugged terrain they cross lead to numerous challenges not typically faced with conventional cross-country pipelines across the plains.The logistics and access challenges faced by these mountain pipeline projects require significant pre-planning and assessment, to determine the timing, cost, regulatory and environmental impacts. The logistics of pipeline construction projects mainly encompasses the transportation of pipe and pipeline materials, construction equipment and supplies, and personnel from point of manufacture or point of supply to the right-of-way (ROW) or construction area. These logistics movement revolve around the available types of access routes and seasonal constraints. Pipeline contractors and logistics companies have vast experience in moving this type of large equipment, however regulatory constraints and environmental restrictions in some locations will lead to significant pre-planning, permitting and additional time and cost for material movement. In addition, seasonal constraints limit available transportation windows.The types of access vary greatly in mountain pipeline projects. In BC, the majority of off-highway roads and bridges were originally constructed for the forestry industry, which transports logs downhill whereas the pipeline industry transports large equipment and pipeline materials in both directions and specifically hauls pipe uphill. The capacity, current state and location of these off-highway roads must be assessed very early in the process to determine viability and/or potential options for construction access. Regulatory requirements, environmental restrictions, season of use restrictions and road design must all be considered when examining the use of or upgrade of existing access roads and bridges. These same restrictions are even more critical to the construction of new access roads and bridges.The logistics and access challenges facing the construction of large diameter mountain pipelines in Western Canada can be managed with proper and timely planning. The cost of the logistics and access required for construction of these proposed pipeline projects will typically be greater than for traditional pipelines, but the key constraint is the considerable time requirement to construct the required new access and preposition the appropriate material to meet the construction schedule. The entire project team, including design engineers, construction and logistics planners, and material suppliers must be involved in the planning stages to ensure a cohesive strategy and schedule. This paper will present the typical challenges faced in access and logistics for large diameter mountain pipelines, and a process for developing a comprehensive plan for their execution.",,,,,10th International Pipeline Conference10th International Pipeline Conference,"SEP 29-OCT 03, 2014SEP 29-OCT 03, 2014",,"Calgary, CANADACalgary, CANADA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4610-0,,,,,,,,,"WorleyParsons, Calgary, AB, Canada",WorleyParsons,,,2014-01-01,WOS:000379455200027,,

To sustain this advantage, the UK must spearhead research and innovation in ORE, which will accelerate its adoption and widen the applicability of these technologies. Many organisations across the industry-academia spectrum contribute to ORE research and development (R&D) co-ordination and the ORE Supergen hub strategy will take a leadership role, integrating with these activities to guide and deliver fundamental research to advance the ORE sector. The role of the Supergen ORE hub is to provide research leadership for the ORE community to enable transformation to future scale ORE. The hub will articulate the vision for the future scale ORE energy landscape, will identify the innovations required and the fundamental research needed to underpin the innovation. It will also generate the pathway for translation of research and innovation into industry practice, for policy adaptation and public awareness in order to support the increased deployment of ORE technologies, reducing energy costs while increasing energy security, reducing CO2 emissions and supporting UK jobs. The hub will work closely with the ORE Catapult (ORECAT) and become well-connected with industry, government, the wider research community in the UK and internationally. It will bring together these groups to assemble the expertise and experience to define and target the innovations, research and actions to achieve the ambitious energy transformation envisioned for the UK.The new Supergen ORE hub will continue to support and build on the existing internationally leading academic capacity within these three research areas (OW, wave and tidal technology), whilst also enabling shared learning on common research challenges. The ORE hub will build a multi-disciplinary, collaborative approach, which will bring benefits through the sharing of best practice and exploitation of synergy, support equality and diversity and the development of the next generation of research leaders.The hub strategy provides an overview of research and innovation priorities, which will be addressed through multiple routes but linked through the hub, with activities designed to stimulate alignment across the research community and industry sectors to maximise engagement with prioritised research challenges through and beyond the hub time-scale. These include:1. Networking and engagement activities to bring the research community together with industry and other stakeholders to ensure research efforts within the community are aligned, complementary and remain inspired by or relevant to industry challenges. This will include support and development of the ECR community to ensure sustainability and promote EDI within the sector as a whole. Actions will also be taken to identify potential cross over research synergies and opportunities for transfer of research between sectors and disciplines, both within and external to ORE. Furthermore, a structured communication plan built around progress of the community towards the sector research challenges will promote exploitation and commercialisation. 2.

The decrease in ice extent in the Arctic has renewed the interest in the Northern Sea route, necessitating further research to evaluate the adequacy of the equipment and appliances used on vessels traversing in polar waters.The introduction of the Polar Code by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) attempts to mitigate some of the risks endangering the vessels in Polar waters. The Polar Code is scheduled to take effect on 01.01.2017, and applies to all vessels traversing in polar waters. One of the requirements in the Polar Code is that means shall be provided to remove or prevent accretion of snow and/or ice from escape routes, embarkation areas and access points. Even though, prior to the formulation of Polar Code, the requirement for de-icing the deck surfaces on vessels already exists, the suitability of the equipment currently in use is debatable. Large amounts of energy is required to maintain an ice-free surface, which is not desirable economically or environmentally, due to the substantial increase in fuel consumption.In this study, a heated deck element manufactured by GMC Maritime AS is subjected to cross flow wind of 5 m/s, 10 m/s and 15 m/s at various sub-zero temperatures in GMC Maritime AS's climate laboratory in Stavanger, Norway. The deck element is rated to 1400 W/m(2), and is one of the designs provided by GMC Maritime AS. The power consumption of the deck element is measured and compared to theoretical heat loss calculations. Large discrepancies between the measured power consumption and the theoretical heat loss were discovered, indicating the need for further studies on the matter.As part of SARex Spitzbergen 2016, a search and rescue exercise conducted off North Spitzbergen, heated deck elements on board the Norwegian Coast Guard Vessel KV Svalbard were studied and are discussed in this paper. The heating elements in the deck elements were designed to specifications at the time of commissioning, but proves insufficient when the vessel is in transit or exposed to slight winds, allowing snow and ice to accumulate on the surface.Finally, suggestions for a more energy efficient design of deck elements are made, as the current designs are found to have potential for improvement, especially due to the lack of insulation between the deck elements and the hull of the vessel.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5776-2,,,,,,,,,"Univ Stavanger, Stavanger, Rogaland, Norway",,,,2017-12-27,WOS:000417226000027,,

J,,,,,,,,,John Harding,,Hard-soft matter interfaces: from understanding to engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Aug 31 2010,2010,"The term material is extremely broad, so for simplicity's sake, materials are often described as either hard or soft . While hard materials such as ceramics are strong, they are often brittle. In contrast, soft materials such as polymers are often mechanically weak, but can show valuable elastic properties. Combining these two in one new composite can therefore give rise to remarkable new materials, which benefit from the advantages of both components. This is just one benefit of combining hard and soft materials. In fact, interaction between hard and soft materials occurs in all walks of life. Whether a medical implant is accepted in the body depends on how cells recognise and interact with the hard implant surface. Controlling this requires that we understand molecular-scale processes, which govern how soft biomolecules interact with surfaces - and also processes occurring on much larger length-scales, most importantly how cells interact and recognise a hard surface. In this case, the soft matter must adapt to the hard surface, potentially changing its shape and chemical properties. This is important for many applications - from the toxicology of nanoparticles to strategies for environmental remediation. Perhaps surprisingly, it is not only hard materials which control the soft - the converse also occurs. Biomineralisation - the formation of mineral structures such as bones, teeth and seashells by organisms - shows this beautifully. It is through interaction of growing minerals with soft, organic matter that Nature produces these materials with their remarkable shapes and properties. Biominerals are often very different from synthetic minerals. While a crystal of calcite (calcium carbonate) precipitated in the lab has a regular, geometric form, in the spines of a sea urchin a calcite single crystal is sponge-like, with curved surfaces replacing flat crystal planes. Biominerals are also almost always composites - soft organic molecules are embedded within the crystal. It is this structure which gives biominerals such wonderful mechanical properties - indeed, tooth enamel is one of the hardest materials known. Soft matter not only affects the properties of biominerals, but controls almost every stage of their formation - from the earliest stages of nucleation, through growth, to production of the final biomineral. Insoluble organic molecules define the special environments in which biominerals form and nucleate, while small, soluble organic molecules bind to a crystal during growth, influencing its shape. Clearly, understanding how soft and hard materials interact and control each other is of great importance, and has applications spanning disciplines from medicine to geology, from climate science to nanotechnology. The strategies used by biology to produce biominerals can be applied to the design and fabrication of new materials - where the structure can be controlled at the atomic scale, and the synthesis carried out under mild conditions. If we can design molecules to attach to surfaces strongly, we can use them to inhibit crystal growth. Crystals growing where they should not - in boilers, heating systems and oil wells - remains a major problem in industry and domestic life. Finally, many biomaterials are carbonates. They are a part of the planet's carbon cycle - a major way in which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere for long periods. In the oceans, structures such as coral reefs are under threat due to changes in oceanic conditions; we need to understand the mechanisms of their growth to understand fully why. Removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converting it into carbonates is a possible carbon capture strategy. The research carried out in this grant will use both experiment and theory in a unique way to shed light on the fundamental mechanisms behind this most fascinating and essential capability of the biosphere and to harness this knowledge to develop of novel materials.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/I001514/1,,,,,,,,University of Sheffield,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15414936,,

The synthesis technique requires low temperatures and ambient pressure and does not use any inert gases and organic solvents. The method has potential to be developed into a massively parallel process for large-scale production. The as-synthesized iron oxide NPs were tested and compared with NPs produced from a previously developed batch method in terms of chemical and structural properties and their potential oil removal from aqueous samples relevant to the environment. Analysis showed that NPs produced from FT synthesis largely maintained their structural properties, although both core and hydrodynamic size of the NPs were slightly larger than those from the batch method, potentially affecting specific surface area and their ability to remove oil from aqueous solutions under challenging conditions. Nevertheless, results from experiments quantifying oil removal from water in synthetic seawater, with or without added fulvic acid or alginic acid, indicated that NPs synthesized from the FT technique showed excellent oil removal capacity (essentially 100% removal).

The main objective is to stabilize the bottomhole pressure at a critical depth at a desired set-point directly. The time-delay in the transmission line of the drilling systems is considered. The stabilization of the dynamic system and the asymptotic tracking are demonstrated by the proposed predictor control, where the adaptation employs Lyapunov update law design with normalization. The proposed method is evaluated using a high fidelity drilling simulator and cases from a North Sea drilling operation are simulated. The results show that the proposed predictor controller is effective to stabilize the bottom hole pressure within the desired bound and compensate the effects of the delay in MPD. The simulation also shows that the proposed method provides good tracking, good disturbance rejection, and good compensation of time-delay. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J,,,,,,,,,Stephanie Henson,,SEASONAL VARIABILITY IN THE EFFICIENCY OF UPPER OCEAN CARBON EXPORT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Apr 01 2012,2012,"The oceans are a major repository for atmospheric carbon. An important component of the global carbon cycle is the ocean's biological carbon pump (BCP), which is dominated by the sinking of organic particles from the surface ocean to its interior. Of the material generated via phytoplankton primary production in surface waters, most is recycled in the upper ocean. A small fraction is exported to the deep ocean and sequestered away from further contact with the atmosphere on timescales of hundreds to thousands of years. Both the size and efficiency of the BCP are predicted to decline globally in response to climate change, potentially resulting in reduced ocean carbon storage and hence increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Therefore, accurately quantifying the magnitude and efficiency of the global BCP is essential to understanding the Earth's carbon cycle and the impact of continued anthropogenic inputs of carbon dioxide. However, current estimates of the strength of the BCP range 4-fold, suggesting that despite more than 30 years of study, no consensus on its magnitude has yet been reached. There is even more uncertainty about what controls the efficiency of the BCP and its variability on seasonal timescales.Recently, a new parameterisation of the export ratio (which describes the efficiency of the upper ocean BCP) was developed by the PI and co-authors. This suggested that the BCP efficiency was substantially lower than previously thought. However, our parameterisation of the export ratio has relatively large uncertainty at cold sea surface temperature. The export ratio is thought to be driven in large part by the type of phytoplankton present in the upper ocean, because large, dense phytoplankton sink rapidly and export more efficiently than smaller plankton. Our hypothesis is that the variability in export ratio at low temperatures is due to strong seasonality in phytoplankton bloom evolution at high latitudes, driven by temporal shifts in phytoplankton community structure. This project will assess how seasonal variability of the phytoplankton bloom alters the export ratio in the sub-Arctic through a combination of in situ and satellite data based studies. We propose to collate measurements of upper ocean particulate organic carbon flux and simultaneous phytoplankton community structure from two high latitude regions with suitably cold SST and strong variability in phytoplankton blooms. This project will use data to be collected on a UK Ocean Acidification Research Programme cruise to the Arctic (work already funded by NERC), and on a cruise to the Labrador Sea, for which funds are requested here. We propose to participate in an existing cruise in May 2012 (funded by DFO Canada) to take additional measurements of export flux and phytoplankton community structure. The variability in bloom stage and PCS encountered during the cruises will be used to determine the impact of seasonal gradients in bloom conditions on the export efficiency. We will then apply the understanding gained from the regional studies to a global database of export measurements, using satellite-derived data on sea surface temperature, bloom stage and phytoplankton community structure. We will then develop a revised parameterisation of the export ratio, including relevant seasonal information and in the final stage of the proposed work, apply our revised parameterisation globally to calculate a new estimate of the magnitude of the BCP. The project aims to gain understanding of controls on seasonal variability in the export ratio, and hence reduce uncertainty in the estimate of global BCP magnitude.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/J004383/1,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15322669,,

To estimate the potential carbon storage in the soil from regional surveys it is important to understand the influence of environmental variables (climate, soil type, and landscape) before land management can be assessed. A survey was done of 354 sites to determine soil organic carbon stock (SOC stock; Mg C/ha) across the Lachlan and Macquarie catchments of New South Wales, Australia. The influences of climate, soil physical and chemical properties, landscape position, and 10 years of land management information were assessed. The environmental variables described most of the regional variation compared with management. The strongest influence on SOC stock at 0-10cm was from climatic variables, particularly 30-year average annual rainfall. At a soil depth of 20-30cm, the proportion of silica (SiO2) determined by mid-infrared spectra (Si-MIR) had a negative relationship with SOC stock, and sand and clay measured by particle size analysis also showed strong relationships at sites where measured. Of the difference in SOC stock explained by land use, cropping had lower soil carbon than pasture in rotation or permanent pasture at 0-10cm. This relationship was consistent across a rainfall gradient, but once soil carbon was standardised per mm of average annual rainfall, there was a greater difference between cropping and permanent pasture with increasing Si-MIR in soils. Land use is also regulated by climate, topography, and soil type, and the effect on SOC stock is better assessed in smaller land-management units to remove some variability due to climate and soil.",,,,,,,,,50,4,0,0,41,0,54,,,1838-675X,1838-6768,,,,,,,,,,"Orange Agr Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Orange, NSW 2800, AustraliaNSW Off Environm & Heritage, Cowra, NSW 2794, AustraliaCharles Sturt Univ Orange, NSW Off Environm & Heritage, Orange, NSW 2800, AustraliaUniv New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",,,,2014-01-22,WOS:000328733100007,,

The underwater spread of oil spill in a shear flow was studied experimentally in a re-circulating water channel. The high speed imaging technology was employed to record the whole transport process of oil spilt from a leak of a submarine pipe to the surface. Based on the experimental results, three underwater transport types are identified, which are single droplet pattern (model A), linear chain pattern (model B) and oil plume pattern (model C), respectively. The pressure difference inside and outside of the leak determines the underwater transport pattern. For single droplet pattern, the transport of oil droplet has two successive stage, namely the accumulation stage and the buoyant droplet stage. When it comes to linear chain pattern, the first stage changes to be the initial jet stage. Besides the initial jet stage and the buoyant droplet stage, oil plume pattern has an intermediate transition stage, namely the plume development stage. During the whole floating process, the pressure difference dominates the initial stage, while droplet buoyancy is the driven force in the rest. The required time for oil droplets to reach the surface is increased with the decreasing of the initial momentum and the increasing of the shear flow velocity. In the buoyance dominated stage, the floating rate of oil droplets is basically unchanged and the horizontal migration rate is similar with the shear flow velocity. Both the break-up and coalescence of oil droplets have two forms, which are single droplet splitting and droplet-column separation for break-up form and turbulence merging and pursuit merging for coalescence form, respectively.

Since marine regulations have been formulated to cover liquid natural gas (LNG) as a primary propulsion fuel, we frame our examination of LH2 as a comparison to LNG, for both maritime use in general, and the SF-BREEZE in particular. Due to weaker attractions between molecules, LH2 is colder than LNG, and evaporates more easily. We describe the consequences of these physical differences for the size and duration of spills of the two cryogenic fuels. The classical flammability ranges are reviewed, with a focus on how fuel buoyancy modifies these combustion limits. We examine the conditions for direct fuel explosion (detonation) and contrast them with initiation of normal (laminar) combustion. Direct fuel detonation is not a credible accident scenario for the SF-BREEZE. For both fuels, we review experiments and theory elucidating the deflagration to detonation transition (DDT). LH2 fires have a shorter duration than energy-equivalent LNG fires, and produce significantly less thermal radiation. The thermal (infrared) radiation from hydrogen fires is also strongly absorbed by humidity in the air. Hydrogen permeability is not a leak issue for practical hydrogen plumbing. We describe the chemistry of hydrogen and methane at iron surfaces, clarifying their impact on steel-based hydrogen storage and transport materials. These physical, chemical and combustion properties are pulled together in a comparison of how a LH2 or LNG pool fire on the Top Deck of the SF-BREEZE might influence the structural integrity of the aluminum deck. Neither pool fire scenario leads to net heating of the aluminum decking. Overall, LH2 and LNG.are very similar in their physical and combustion properties, thereby posing similar safety risks. For ships utilizing LH2 or LNG, precautions are needed to avoid fuel leaks, minimize ignition sources, minimize confined spaces, provide ample ventilation for required confined spaces, and to monitor the enclosed spaces to ensure any fuel accumulation is detected far below the fuel/air mix threshold for any type of combustion.

According to our previous work (Y. Sea, S.P. Kang, Enhancing CO2 separation for pre-combustion capture with hydrate formation in silica gel pore structure, Chem. Eng. J. 161 (2010) 308-312), the cage occupancy of CO2 in mixed gas hydrates with H-2 is enhanced by the use of a silica gel pore structure containing water. Based on that result, a simulated fuel gas is applied to form gas hydrates, and a richer CO2 containing gas stream is thereby retrieved through dissociation of the hydrates from a single-stage reactor. Equilibrium dissociation pressures of CO2 + H-2 gas mixtures were measured with silica gel particles with pore sizes of 25, 100, and 250 am. The effect of CO2 concentration on equilibrium dissociation pressures was also investigated at a silica gel pore diameter of 100 nm. The results indicate that when a simulated fuel gas has formed in 100 nm silica gel pores, a gas stream containing more than 96 mol% of CO2 is achieved by one-stage gas hydrate formation in a silica gel pore structure, which is comparable to the result (88-92) from hydrate formation in bulk water. In addition to demonstrating enhanced distribution of CO2 in coexisting phases, gas hydrate formation in a fixed-bed type reactor charged with silica gel particles containing water in pores is investigated. The formation of gas hydrates in silica gel pores occurred to a high extent and at a high rate, and the proposed method is thus expected to be a promising CO2 capture tool for pre-combustion.

A positive correlation is obtained between the meridional overturning or residual circulation in the Southern Ocean and atmospheric CO2: stronger or northward-shifted westerly winds in the Southern Hemisphere result in increased residual circulation, greater upwelling of carbon-rich deep waters and oceanic outgassing, which increases atmospheric pCO(2) by similar to 20 mu atm; weaker or southward-shifted winds lead to the opposing result. The ocean carbon inventory in our model varies through contrasting changes in the saturated, disequilibrium and biogenic (soft-tissue and carbonate) reservoirs, each varying by O(10-100) PgC, all of which contribute to the net anomaly in atmospheric CO2. Increased residual overturning deepens the global pycnocline, warming the upper ocean and decreasing the saturated carbon reservoir. Increased upwelling of carbon- and nutrient-rich deep waters and inefficient biological activity results in subduction of unutilized nutrients into the ocean interior, decreasing the biogenic carbon reservoir of intermediate and mode waters ventilating the Northern Hemisphere, and making the disequilibrium carbon reservoir more positive in the mode waters due to the reduced residence time at the surface. Wind-induced changes in the model carbon inventory are dominated by the response of the global pycnocline, although there is an additional abyssal response when the peak westerly winds change their latitude, altering their proximity to Drake Passage and changing the depth extent of the southward return flow of the overturning: a northward shift of the westerly winds isolates dense isopycnals, allowing biogenic carbon to accumulate in the deep ocean of the Southern Hemisphere, while a southward shift shoals dense isopycnals that outcrop in the Southern Ocean and reduces the biogenic carbon store in the deep ocean.",,,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,10,0,52,,,0930-7575,1432-0894,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Dept Earth Ocean & Ecol Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, EnglandUniv Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, EnglandMIT, Dept Earth Atmosphere & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,,2013-10-01,WOS:000324812200026,,

J,,,,,,,,,"Cherepovitsyna,Alina",,Strategic forecasting of development of industrial and mineral resources centers in the Arctic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jul 01 2019,2019,"The issues of development of the Russian Arctic territories, which experts directly associate with the development of transport infrastructure and the development of mineral resources in the Arctic, in recent years have become increasingly important, scientific and practical importance. The Arctic shelf is one of the main reserves of hydrocarbons, and within the continental part of the Arctic there are unique reserves and forecast resources of rare metals and rare earth elements, copper-nickel ores, agrochemical raw materials, tin, large reserves of gold, diamonds, ferrous metals and other types of mineral fossil. The development of gas hydrates in the Arctic is promising. The presence of such a quantity of mineral resources in the Arctic is one of the most important competitive advantages of the Russian economy. At the state level, a number of regulatory documents have been developed in the field of the development of the Arctic territories, including on the development of the mineral resource base and the development of mineral resources in the Arctic. According to the latest initiatives of the state and large companies of the mineral resource complex, the emphasis is rightly placed on strengthening geological exploration in the Arctic territories. With a fairly extensive list of the existing regulatory framework in the Russian Federation on Arctic development, strategic planning in general, mineral resource development, and the fairly wide popularity of these issues in the scientific and expert communities, it can be concluded that the strategic and strategic methodologies Forecasting in relation to the development of industrial raw materials does not exist. As part of the development of the concept and methodology, as well as specific forecasts for the development of industrial complexes in the Arctic, it is necessary to take into account a number of complex factors of the internal and external environment at various levels from the macro to the meso and micro levels. The study and conceptual modeling of such factors seems to be a separate scientific problem due to the fact that the system under study is extremely complex. It is necessary to take into account the development trends of mineral and raw material markets, infrastructure and socio-economic development of territories, the level of development of equipment and technologies for certain types of minerals, opportunities for international cooperation, the political situation, the level of development of government regulation, structural changes in the economy of foreign countries, raw material base and many others. Moreover, each of these factors is complex, there is also a relationship between them. In methodological terms, there is a problem with the forecasting tools. Extrapolation forecasts, which are based on the tendencies of the past, are not applicable to the solution of this problem, since the stable patterns of development of industrial and raw material centers in the Arctic have not taken shape. Conceptual modeling of internal and external factors that determine the development of a complex can be applied in part, since any assessment of the future development of mineral resource centers for the long term will be probabilistic in nature. With regard to statistical methods of forecasting, their use is significantly limited due to the lack of historical data and the difficulty of translating the entire set of factors into a quantitative (numerical) expression. In addition, the hierarchy of forecast models should be observed (state, Arctic, specific region, company, project, etc.). Based on the foregoing, it can be concluded that, to date, conceptual and methodological approaches to the strategic forecasting of the development of industrial raw material centers in the Arctic zone, taking into account their industry specificity and critical importance, have practically not been reflected in the works of researchers. The above defines a scientific problem, the solution of which will be the proposed project. The main goal of this study is to improve the theoretical and methodological foundations of the strategic management of complex industrial systems in terms of developing and substantiating the concept and methodology of strategic forecasting of the development of such systems on the example of industrial raw materials centers of the Arctic zone, taking into account their industry specificity and critical significance. The development of scientifically-based strategic forecasts for the development of key mineral resource centers in the Arctic will have a favorable effect on the strategizing and planning of the development of the Arctic region, the formation of a balanced national economy capable of responding to global challenges. The systematic substantiated development of the Arctic with the formation of industrial-raw material complexes (mineral resource centers, support zones) can rightly be considered one of the main drivers of the transition of the Russian economy to a new technological structure.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,19-78-00108,,,,,,,,Saint-Petersburg Mining University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15289171,,

The two challenges are closely interrelated, and each is heightened by climate change. The objective of Government Policy arising from the Water Framework Directive is to have all waters in the member State in a 'good condition' by 2015. It is acknowledged that this target may not be met, but if a reduction in eutrophication levels is not evident by then, more drastic legislative steps may be taken to reduce the risk of losses of nutrients to water bodies. These could reduce farm productivity or at least add to production costs in some circumstances. With the gradual removal of milk quotas, there is a unique opportunity in Ireland to significantly increase milk production. The challenge for Teagasc, INRA and European Agriculture Research is to develop systems through science, innovation and development methodologies that allow dairy farmers to expand milk production without compromising water quality. Until recently, many farmers have been unaware of the environmental and financial costs associated with water pollution and have often not recognised the environmental and socio-economic benefits they could provide to the wider society by implementing best management practices. Implementation and adoption of these measures and practices have mostly been hampered by the relatively low price of easily available N and P fertilizers, which often made it more cost effective to apply fertilizers in excess than implement best management practices. This situation has changed dramatically in recent times with large increases in fossil fuel prices resulting in a correspondingly large increase in the cost of fertilizer. The Water Framework Directive is concerned with nutrient enrichment of water bodies, in particular from P and N, the causes of eutrophication. The sustainability of grass-based systems can be improved through increasing the efficiency of conversion of inputs to products, increasing the use efficiency of organic manures and the selection of the optimal cow for the specific system. The presence of grassland will be more favourable to biodiversity and the conservation of soils and carbon storage than cropping systems. Climate change may further enhance grass-based systems in areas with oceanic climate and increase the use of legumes in roughage production. If we are going to be successful in meeting the objectives of the Water Framework Directive it is imperative that there is continual and open dialogue between the science community and those that work in policy and manage land. Farmers are unlikely to be able to implement changes on their own. There is little point identifying environmentally damaging agricultural practices unless related agricultural research provides feasible and economically viable alternatives that farmers can implement. Without the active involvement of all participants in the entire process, from problem identification through to solution, there will not be any long term resolution.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,9,0,9,,,1649-1009,,,,,,,,,,,"TEAGASC, Moorepk Prod Res Ctr, Fermoy, Cork, Ireland",,,,2009-01-01,BCI:BCI201000473725,,

Direct current provides the accumulation of electric energy and is therefore necessary when using renewable energy sources.The social and environmental aspects, as well as climatic and glaciological features of the Arctic development in terms of energy supply are considered. The most expedient ways of complex development of the Arctic are shown. In terms of large and unique stationary projects a number of shortcomings is marked. They are high cost and long-term construction, incomplete autonomy and insufficient solution of ecological and waste processing problems. Incomplete autonomy is due to the need for transportation of materials, products, replacement crews and personnel, as well as insufficient logistics and transportation difficulties on the mainland in summer and by sea in winter. Ecological and waste processing problems are associated with the use of traditional methods of burning solid and liquid fuel using coal or fuel oil, polluting the environment. Switching to the liquefied natural gas (LNG) for electric propulsion and power supply will significantly improve the environmental situation. The research performed on the mathematical model of the multifunctional energy complex (MEC) showed the possibility of uninterrupted power supply of local load from the centralized network, diesel generator (DG) and the electricity storage (ES); by that DG is used to save fuel as a backup source. The proposed technologies of power generation based on hydrogen or low-power nuclear power plants (LPNPPs) allow, along with improving the environment, to increase the energy efficiency of the direct fuel conversion plant and provide integrated waste processing. The small population of the Arctic, its mobility when using the rotational method require the integrated development of mobile energy and life support systems of low power up to 30 MW using LNG or LPNPPs, completed by renewable energy sources (RES). If the hydrogen installation is both a source and a storage of electricity, the use of LPNPPs and especially RES require energy storage devices. These hydrogen or electrochemical cycle storage devices are the most progressive in the world energy sector and their applicability significantly depends on the development of the service infrastructure. Typing and replication of power supply sources will solve the problem of development of remote and isolated regions of the Arctic through the integrated use of innovative technologies for generation, storage, transmission and distribution of electricity, life support, utilization and recycling of wastes, environmental conservation using hydrogen energy and digital control and monitoring systems.The climatic conditions of the Arctic and the presence of LNG determine the use of hydrogen as a source for generating electricity, heat, water and air.

Water dew point adjustment is particularly challenging in the remote ultra-deepwater natural gas reserves of the Brazilian Pre-Salt fields due to their very high carbon dioxide contents - from 30% up to 90% in raw natural gas - which is a consequence from the carbonaceous rock of the reservoir structure and long term elevation of carbon dioxide content due to its injection for early enhanced oil recovery. Under this scenario, the study evaluates the impact of the carbon dioxide content of the natural gas on the performance of water dew point via water adsorption on 4 A Zeolite molecular sieve beds. Process simulation with adsorption simulator Adsim (Aspen Technology, Inc), at varying operation pressures and carbon dioxide contents in raw natural gas, indicated that, although adsorption meets water removal specification in a condensation free operation, the high fugacity of carbon dioxide penalizes the dehydration performance due to probably two facts: (i) higher carbon dioxide fugacity in the humid natural gas imply higher saturation water content in the gas phase, which increases the service of dehydration units; and (ii) higher carbon dioxide fugacity in the humid natural gas establishes a discreet adsorption competition with water resulting in 6.5% increase of adsorbent bed volume for operating pressures of 35 bar or higher.

The following research provides key information about the real energy consumption and CO2 emissions of one of the most relevant container terminals in the Mediterranean area, located in Valencia, Spain. The results show that yard terminal tractors and rubber tyred gantry cranes (RTGs) are the main emission sources, accounting for 68.1% of the terminal's total CO2 emissions. After identifying the equipment responsible for the environmental problem, two solutions aimed at improving the energy efficiency of the terminal have been studied: the retrofitting of RTGs cranes and the replacement of terminal tractors powered by fuel for a new liquefied natural gas tractor, which contributed to a large reduction of CO2 emissions.

However, it is challenging to remotely retrieve such information from turbid Case-2 waters. This paper reviews four aspects of the major achievements in remotely sensed coastal and inland water quality in China. Specifically, achievements in atmospheric correction prior to water quality retrieval, progress in water-related sensor design, developments (improvements) to existing Case-2 water algorithms, and advances in oil spill and harmful algal bloom monitoring. Major challenges are identified, including: 1) a large mismatch exists between the water quality information required and RS datasets due to a lack of professional inland water sensors; 2) planned monitoring and field experiments for studying the optical properties of inland waters are scarce; and 3) RS of urban black odorous waters and international rivers is of great urgency.

The development of more effective dispersants with less toxicity and higher biodegradability would be a step forward in improving public acceptance and regulatory approvals for their use. By applying advances in environmental biotechnology, a bio-dispersant agent with a lipopeptide biosurfactant produced byBacillus subtilisN3-1P as the key component was formulated in this study. The economic feasibility of producing biosurfactant (a high-added-value bioproduct) from fish waste-based peptone as a nutrient substrate was evaluated. Protein hydrolyzate was prepared from cod liver and head wastes obtained from fish processing facilities. Hydrolysis conditions (i.e., time, temperature, pH and enzyme to substrate level) for preparing protein hydrolyzates were optimized by response surface methodology using a factorial design. The critical micelle dilution (CMD) value for biosurfactant produced from the fish liver and head waste generated peptones was 54.72 and 47.59 CMD, respectively. Biosurfactant product generated by fish liver peptone had a low critical micelle concentration of 0.18 g L(-1)and could reduce the surface tension of distilled water to 27.9 mN/m. Structure characterization proved that the generated biosurfactant product belongs to the lipopeptide class. An alternative to the key surfactant dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium (DOSS) used in Corexit 9500 has been proposed based on a binary mixture of lipopeptides and DOSS that exhibited synergistic effects. Using the standard baffled flask test, a high dispersion efficiency of 76.8% for Alaska North Slope oil was achieved at a biodispersant composition of 80/20 (v/v) of lipopeptides/DOSS.

(VPI), and advances in material science and manufacturing of composite blades by Energetx Composites, Inc. (ECI) to tackle major technological and environmental roadblocks hindering commercial development and wide-spread deployment of technologies for harnessing MHK energy resources; and 2) contribute toward educating the next generation workforce for the MHK industry with emphasis on Native American students. A three-pronged research plan is proposed aimed at 1) Designing and testing via fluid-structure interaction computational tools the next generation of MHK turbine rotor blades optimized for reliable and efficient operation in real-life aquatic environments; 2) Optimizing via site-specific computational modeling the layout of VPI's pilot-scale 30-turbine, 1.05MW array to be developed in the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy (RITE) site in the East River in New York City; and 3) Developing and demonstrating the utility of the computational tools for quantifying and mitigating environmental effects due to coupled MHK array-geomorphology interactions. At the core of the educational plan of this project is the collaboration with Salish Kootenai Colleg (SKC), which will seek to enrich the 4-year degree program of this college with technological and entrepreneurial content focused on MHK energy. The computational framework to be used in this project is able to carry out high-resolution simulations of turbulence in arbitrarily complex waterways with embedded natural and/or man-made hydraulic structures and/or MHK turbines and multi-turbine arrays, taking into account hydro-elastic effects of turbine blades, and the interactions between turbines and waterway morphodynamic processes. This computational framework will be further developed and demonstrated in a real-world MHK project by leveraging the industry-leading expertise and unique field facilities of the two small business partners. The resulting simulation-based toolbox will be translated to the business partners to provide them for the first time with in depth mechanistic understanding of how turbines perform in and interact with real-life aquatic environments; and a powerful simulation-based engineering science toolbox for site-specific optimization of turbine arrays for efficiency and environmental compatibility. Technologies for harnessing clean and renewable energy from MHK resources are currently at the pre-commercial stage of development and a number of technological and environmental challenges need to be overcome for this emerging industry to impact the nation's economy and renewable energy portfolio. Today, the U.S. MHK industry is at a stage similar to the early days of wind power technology prior to the emergence of a viable industry. Due to market pressures confronting small businesses in a nascent industry sector, the innovation capacity of companies like VPI and ECI is seriously impaired. The proposed PFI will enable both industry partners to leverage unique state-of-the-art simulation tools and emerge as international leaders in the MHK industry. Furthermore, the success of VPI's highly visible RITE project in New York City will provide a major boost to the entire U.S. MHK industry sector and help accelerate the wide-spread deployment of MHK energy technologies throughout the nation. The PFI educational plan will provide pilot content for the SKC Hydrology degree program that will uniquely link a Native American reservation with promising new technologies at a point where technology and entrepreneurial development are happening simultaneously; open-up a new potential marketplace for MHK technology in rural communities on a Native American reservation; and pilot this effort as a model for implementation in other rural communities in the U.S. and in third-world countries.

It is, however, only partly possible to convert the feedingstuffs used into animal products. This is mainly due to the maintenance requirements of the animal, which always have to be met but which are ''unproductive'', and also to the incomplete digestibility and the low biological value of the particular feed. Those nutrients which the animal does not make use of for growth purposes are excreted, mostly in a chemically altered form (faeces, urine, digestive gasses). The excreted products make valuable manure but where there is too much of them in a particular region they also cause ecological problems as there is then a danger that reaction products will get into the atmosphere and hydrosphere in greater quantities. Here ammonia (NH3), phosphate and methane (CH4) are of special interest.In order to keep environmental contamination from the substances mentioned as low as possible two strategies can be followed, that is, reducing the emission potential and handling the animal wastes with as little loss as possible. In the first case measures leading to a short fattening period and to supplying the animals with exactly the quantity of nutrients they require are particularly important. In the second case manure needs to be stored and spread with as little loss as possible.

China is a big energy consuming country with coal as a dominant energy. With the development of the society, energy shortage and environmental pollution are becoming great obstacles to the progress of the country. Therefore, in order to ensure the sustainable development of the society, it is of great significance to develop and utilize NGH and vigorously develop the gas hydrate technology.

This remains true with the rural representing a contested site characterised by debates concerning food and fibre, water and energy security. With the recent deployment of new energy technologies in areas traditionally used for agricultural production, increased confrontation and resistance over land use has forged unlikely alliances between farmers, environmentalists and concerned others, ultimately leading to the rise of a new form of rural citizenship. In the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) where resistance to burgeoning coal seam gas operations has become the customary response of many rural communities, environmentalists and concerned others are mobilising in support of farmers, who self-identify as modern-day stewards and are actively working to protect a resource hierarchy of water, land and soil against industries believed to be putting these at risk. Adopting a qualitative case-study approach, this paper examines how residents and supporters in the regional Shire of Narrabri in NSW have responded to what many see as competing land uses.

Due to the solar and lunar influx on our planet, they move large amounts of water periodically, and this energy can be harnessed using devices designed and positioned adequately, such as current turbines. However, the relation between the energy obtained with actual devices and the economic and environmental cost of their installation limits the practical application of these solutions. In order to optimize the design of this technology and achieve its successful installation and use, a detailed knowledge about the energy potential of tides at the specific location is necessary. This calculation is not easy and requires the use of specialized software tools. Currently, there is no specific software to evaluate the tidal currents energy potential, but there are more than a few codes able to calculate the hydraulic flow in rivers, estuaries and coastal regions. These programs are usually used for the calculation of pollutant dispersion and floods, but they can be adapted with more or less success.

The dominant policy view, as stated in the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, is that sustainable forest harvesting yielding wood products, generates the largest mitigation benefit. We demonstrate that changing native forest management from commercial harvesting to conservation can make an important contribution to mitigation. Conservation of native forests results in an immediate and substantial reduction in net emissions relative to a reference case of commercial harvesting. We calibrated models to simulate scenarios of native forest management for two Australian case studies: mixed-eucalypt in New South Wales and Mountain Ash in Victoria. Carbon stocks in the harvested forest included forest biomass, wood and paper products, waste in landfill, and bioenergy that substituted for fossil fuel energy. The conservation forest included forest biomass, and subtracted stocks for the foregone products that were substituted by non-wood products or plantation products. Total carbon stocks were lower in harvested forest than in conservation forest in both case studies over the 100-year simulation period. We tested a range of potential parameter values reported in the literature: none could increase the combined carbon stock in products, slash, landfill and substitution sufficiently to exceed the increase in carbon stock due to changing management of native forest to conservation. The key parameters determining carbon stock change under different forest management scenarios are those affecting accumulation of carbon in forest biomass, rather than parameters affecting transfers among wood products. This analysis helps prioritise mitigation activities to focus on maximising forest biomass. International forest-related policies, including negotiations under the UNFCCC, have failed to recognize fully the mitigation value of native forest conservation. Our analyses provide evidence for decision-making about the circumstances under which forest management provides mitigation benefits.",,,,,,,,,21,3,0,0,13,0,27,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, AustraliaAustralian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Law, Ctr Climate Law & Policy, Canberra, ACT, AustraliaGriffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Southport, Qld 4215, Australia",,,,2015-10-28,WOS:000362499200039,26436916,

The research goal of this work was to evaluate the sustainability of the new hydrocarbons sector. This was attained using a set of indicators, developed from the combination of PESTEL (Political, Economic, Technical, Social, Environmental, Legal) and SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analyses. These were quantified using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) weighting method. They were pairwise compared and evaluated, resulting to a size for each one. The judgements of four evaluators, representing diverse interested parties, were used. The strengths and opportunities of the sector were found to be more than the weaknesses and threats. The relevant indicators quantification demonstrates also that the value of the positives is higher than the negatives. Therefore, if the first are enhanced and the latter are mitigated, there is sustainability potential. The sectors environmental issues are evaluated as the most important, followed by the economic.

The modelling framework was applied to a typical carbon capture plant artificially placed at Mongstad, on the west coast of Norway. The study region is characterized by high precipitation amounts, relatively few sunshine hours, predominantly westerly winds from the North Atlantic and complex topography. Mongstad can be considered as moderately polluted due to refinery activities. WRF-EMEP enables a detailed treatment of amine chemistry in addition to atmospheric transport and deposition. Deposition fluxes of WRF-EMEP simulations were used as input to the fugacity model in order to derive concentrations of nitramines and nitrosamine in lake water. Predicted concentrations of nitramines and nitrosamines in ground-level air and drinking water were found to be highly sensitive to the description of amine chemistry, especially of the night-time chemistry with the nitrate (NO3) radical. Sensitivity analysis of the fugacity model indicates that catchment characteristics and chemical degradation rates in soil and water are among the important factors controlling the fate of these compounds in lake water. The study shows that realistic emission of commonly used amines result in levels of the sum of nitrosamines and nitramines in ground-level air (0.6-10 pgm(-3)) and drinking water (0.04-0.25 ng L-1) below the current safety guideline for human health that is enforced by the Norwegian Environment Agency.

This has prevented industrial organizations and companies from adequately developing and implementing successful health and safety intervention programs aimed at decreasing or eliminating incidents. In an attempt to improve the working environment, several researchers have suggested the creation of a safety culture which enables management to develop hazard free workplace. In this research, a model of effective safety and health program has been developed that incorporates qualitative and quantitative techniques to relate past incident rates, safety resources allocation and intervention activities.

Aside from significantly contributing to the country's revenue, shipping is an indispensable aspect of the oil and gas sector, the bastion of Nigeria's economic, sociopolitical, and infrastructural development. Thus, active participation of Nigerians in the shipping subsector, as well as other sectors, is unassailable and imperative, culminating in the introduction of cabotage in Nigeria. The kernel of this paper is to critically analyse the cabotage regime in Nigeria from the lenses of ship acquisition and shipbuilding with a view to enhancing indigenous participation in coastal and inland waterway transport in the country. The author argues that inadequate funding and absence of investment are central in hampering ship acquisition and the development of shipbuilding capability, thereby undermining cabotage in Nigeria. This paper further asserts that the extant cabotage legal regime in Nigeria is fundamentally flawed due to the existence of waivers without safeguards to protect indigenous ship operators. Moreover, the waiver regime does not encourage technology transfer. The paper concludes by reiterating that adequate funds and investments in human and shipping infrastructural development and the amendment of the Cabotage Act to reflect the removal of surcharges and the inclusion of transfer of technology and other safeguards to the waivers are imperative in ensuring a proper and effective cabotage regime in Nigeria.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1651-436X,1654-1642,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Lagos Campus, Nigerian Inst Adv Legal Studies, Lagos, Nigeria",,,,2018-04-02,WOS:000427435800006,,

Until now, only one published study, carried out by our group, has identified chromosome bands affected by exposure to oil from an oil spill. In that study, which was performed two years after the initial oil exposure in individuals who had participated in clean-up tasks following the wreck of the Prestige, three chromosomal bands (2q21, 3q27, 5q31) were found to be especially prone to breakage. A recent follow-up study, performed on the same individuals, revealed that the genotoxic damage had persisted six years after oil exposure.ObjectivesTo determine whether there exist chromosome bands which are especially prone to breakages and to know if there is some correlation with those detected in the previous study. In addition, to investigate if the DNA repair problems detected previously persist in the present study.DesignFollow-up study performed six years after the Prestige oil spill.SettingFishermen cooperatives in coastal villages.ParticipantsFishermen highly exposed to oil spill who participated in previous genotoxic study six years after the oil.MeasurementsChromosome damage in peripheral lymphocytes. For accurate identification of the breakpoints involved in chromosome damage of circulating lymphocytes, a sequential stain/Gbanding technique was employed. To determine the most break-prone chromosome bands, two statistical methods, the Fragile Site Multinomial and the chi-square tests ( where the bands were corrected by their length) were used. To compare the chromosome lesions, structural chromosome alterations and gaps/breaks between two groups of individuals we used the GEE test which takes into account a possible within-individual correlation. Dysfunctions in DNA repair mechanisms, expressed as chromosome damage, were assessed in cultures with aphidicolin by the GEE test.ResultsCytogenetic analyses were performed in 47 exposed individuals. A total of 251 breakpoints in exposed individuals) were identified, showing a non-uniform distribution in the human ideogram. Ten chromosome bands were found to be especially prone to breakage through both statistical methods. By comparing these bands with those observed in certain exposed individuals who had already participated the previous study, it was found in both studies that four bands (2q21, 3q27, 5q31 and 17p11.2) are particularly sensitive to breakage. Additionally, the dysfunction in DNA repair mechanisms was not significantly higher in oil-exposed individuals than in non-exposed individuals.LimitationsThe sample size and the possibility of some kind of selection bias should be considered. Genotoxic results cannot be extrapolated to the high number of individuals who participated occasionally in clean-up tasks.ConclusionOur findings show the existence of at least four target bands (2q21, 3q27, 5q31 and 17p11.2) with a greater propensity to break over time after an acute exposure to oil. The breaks in these bands, which are commonly involved in hematological cancer, may explain the increase of cancer risk reported in chronically benzene-exposed individuals. In addition, a more efficiency of the DNA repair mechanisms has been detected six years after in fishermen who were highly exposed to the oil spill. To date, only this study, performed by our group on the previous and present genotoxic effects, has analyzed the chromosomal regions affected by breakage after an acute oil exposure.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,0,6,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"UAM, Fac Med, Unitat Biol Cellular & Genet Med, Bellaterra, SpainCIBERES, Bunyola, Mallorca, SpainHosp Clin Inst Invest Biomed August Pi & Sunyer I, Dept Resp Med, Barcelona, SpainHosp Clin San Carlos, Dept Resp Med, Madrid, SpainCtr Recerca Epidemiol Ambiental CREAL, Barcelona, SpainHosp del Mar, Inst Recerca Med, Barcelona, SpainCIBERESP, Barcelona, SpainUAB, Fac Med, Inst Neurociencies, Bellaterra, SpainUAB, Fac Med, Unitat Bioestadist, Bellaterra, SpainComplexo Hosp Univ A Coruna, Dept Resp Med, La Coruna, SpainHosp 12 Octubre, Dept Resp Med, Unidad Epidemiol Clin, Madrid, Spain",,,,2016-08-01,WOS:000381110300012,27479010,

Central Asia is the first region dedicated to enhancing resources diplomacy. Since the breakup of the former Soviet Union in 1991, relatively stable political structures have been maintained in the region, thanks to the introduction of democracy and a free market economy. Estimated as having the world’s third largest oil and gas deposits, it is emerging as a new market characterized by sustainable economic growth and the influx of oil dollars. In this regard, the region has the great potential in terms of the value and achievement of bilateral and packaged strategy in which Korea imports resources while handing down its technologies such as IT, construction, transportation and logistics, and its experience of growth. It also accompanies official development assistance and the establishment of a network of able human resources. The recent biggest achievement of this resources diplomacy with Central Asia is the various fruitful instances of economic cooperation between South Korea and the Central Asian region in addition to the signing of seven MOU deals, including a contract with Kazakhstan for a stake in Kazakhstan’s Zhambyl marine mining lot(1 billion barrels of estimated deposits), a contract with Uzbek and Kazakhstan for the long-term Uranium introduction, and an agreement with Turkmenistan for cooperation in the electric power sector and energy R&D. To address the diversification of energy resources suppliers in Central Asia, Russia, Africa and South America, in addition to the Middle Eastern region, and the development of foreign oil fields is not only the most critical and practical alternative but also an axis of resources diplomacy in the mid to long term. At the same time, as spiraling high oil prices continue and with the further intensification of resources nationalism, urgent matters such as the development of alternative energy sources to oil resources and the transformation of the state-run energy company into large-scale globalized state-run oil companies should be addressed at the level of national strategy.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1975-0145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-01-01,KJD:ART001416390,,

These wet gas compressors are capable of compressing gases containing up to 5% liquid, removing the need for pre-separation and thereby reducing the investment and maintenance costs. However, the presence of liquid in the gas significantly changes the compression performance from that of dry gas, resulting in a reduced process gain and an increased normal operating region for increasing liquid content. A novel backstepping process controller was previously proposed to track and stabilize a desired pressure reference inside the normal operating region, requiring feedback from several variables, including the mass flow. Mass flow is an inaccurate and expensive measurement. Therefore, a full-order high-gain observer is derived for the wet gas compression process with proven local exponential convergence.

It uses waste sulfur generated from oil and gas refineries and up-cycles this waste as the key ingredient for concrete. Invented by Brookhaven National Laboratory and its international partners, the innovative technology uses a patent pending process with byproduct organic materials as well as fillers and a proprietary mixing process to produce an advanced, new clean form of durable concrete at a commercially competitive cost. The product has many practical applications for civil infrastructure, such as pre-cast pipes, roads, pavers, sea walls, and refinery caps. The research conducted in this project will evaluate the microstructure of the new material to better understand its mechanical performance. The Phase I effort will also conduct initial scale-up testing with industrial partners to prove out the potential of this material to be fabricated within existing production methodologies. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can be seen clearly in the environmental benefits of the sulfur polymer concrete material. Waste sulfur stockpiles exceed 21 million metric tons, and with increased regulatory controls over the environmental dangers of waste sulfur and concrete production, this material represents a disruptive technology which removes sulfur from waste streams while generating a small fraction of the greenhouse gases emitted in the production of conventional Portland concrete cement.

This study uses a life cycle assessment to compare emissions from domestic and imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), and heavy-fuel oil (HFO) for marine shipping. The findings show that only high-pressure dual-fuel (HPDF) engines robustly reduce well-to-wake GHG emissions by 10% compared with their HFO-fuelled counterparts. This engine technology is only available for large low-speed engines used in ocean-going vessels (OGVs). For smaller vessels, such as ferries, the current deployment of medium speed low-pressure dual-fuel (MS-LPDF) and lean burn spark ignition (LBSI) gas engines cannot reliably reduce GHG emissions. This is primarily due to the high levels of methane slip from these engines. For air pollution reduction, gas engines are found to be an effective means of reducing nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and, particulate matter without any additional engine aftertreatment. The HPDF engines, however, need aftertreatment or exhaust gas recirculation to meet the International Maritime Organization Tier III regulations. Sulphur controls, such as the 2020 act, move to limit sulphur to 0.5% globally.

Glassy and crystalline basalts exhibit similar rSi in solutions of varying ionic strength and cation concentrations. Rates of all solids are found to increase by 0.3-0.5 log units in the presence of a pCO(2) of 4 bar compared to CO2 pressure of the atmosphere. At atmospheric CO2 pressure, basaltic glass dissolution rates were most increased by the addition of fluoride to solution whereas crystalline basalt rates were most enhanced by the addition of organic ligands. In contrast, peridotite does not display any significant ligand-promoting effect, either in the presence of fluoride or organic acids. Most significantly, Si release rates from the basalts are found to be not more than 0.6 log units slower than corresponding rates of the peridotite at all conditions considered in this study.

Simulated lakes approximated observed bathymetry, but results are sensitive to initial topography and soil ice content. Local topography caused markedly different dynamics for the two lakes. Pear expanded rapidly across low-relief topography, fully drained multiple times, and released little methane in later stages due to Pleistocene carbon depletion by the first and largest lake generation. Claudi grew slowly and continuously across high-relief topography, forming high subaerial banks; partial drainages left remnant horseshoe lakes that continued to expand into virgin yedoma, mobilizing carbon at roughly the same rate irrespective of lake drainage. The similar to 2x discrepancy between simulated CH4 production and observed emission rates in Claudi likely results from misestimation of hot spot ebullition, labile carbon content, CH4:CO2 production ratio, or microbial CH4 oxidation.",,,,,,,,,71,1,0,0,22,0,76,,,2169-8953,2169-8961,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Water & Environm Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USADalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada",,,,2012-03-30,WOS:000302250200002,,

Introducing new technologies bears raises the possibility of introducing unknown risks or-in case of alternatives for already existing technical solutions-higher risk, either human-, environmental-, or property-related. The option of gas transport by natural gas hydrate pellets has been introduced within the Korean joint research project. One key task was the safety evaluation of the novel natural gas hydrate carrier (NGH carrier) developed in the project. The aim of this work was to support and assess the risk aspects of the development to ensure that the risk level for the newly developed concept is as low as for existing competing concepts, especially LNG carriers. The NGH carrier is based on the concept of the self-preservation effect and thereby preserves NGH in the form of pellets at atmospheric pressure and temperatures lower than -20 degrees C. In order to identify all the possible hazards in the system and then enhance the system safety, a Hazard Identification (HAZID) study was conducted. As a result of the HAZID, 80 identified hazards in total were explored and ranked in terms of risk index for the semi-quantitative risk evaluation. Among the hazards identified, three hazards were found to have unacceptable risk level and twenty eight to have acceptable but ALARP risk level. Regarding the hazards with unacceptable risk or ALARP risk, additional safety actions and recommendations for risk control were discussed and proposed in a SAFETY ACTION REGISTER, which would be considered and utilized by designers when developing the detailed system design in the future. In conclusion, the overall safety level of the NGH carrier is considered acceptable. However, it was found that a few external hazards associated with extremely harsh weather could be critical threats to the system.

The 'safe' livestock carrying capacity (LCC) required to maintain resource condition is strongly dependent on climate. We reviewed: the approaches for quantifying LCC; current trends in climate and their effect on components of the grazing system; implications of the 'best estimates' of climate change projections for LCC; the agreement and disagreement between the current trends and projections; and the adequacy of current models of forage production in simulating the impact of climate change. We report the results of a sensitivity study of climate change impacts on forage production across the rangelands, and we discuss the more general issues facing grazing enterprises associated with climate change, such as 'known uncertainties' and adaptation responses (e.g. use of climate risk assessment).We found that the method of quantifying LCC from a combination of estimates (simulations) of long-term (>30 years) forage production and successful grazier experience has been well tested across northern Australian rangelands with different climatic regions. This methodology provides a sound base for the assessment of climate change impacts, even though there are many identified gaps in knowledge. The evaluation of current trends indicated substantial differences in the trends of annual rainfall (and simulated forage production) across Australian rangelands with general increases in most of western Australian rangelands ( including northern regions of the Northern Territory) and decreases in eastern Australian rangelands and south-western Western Australia.Some of the projected changes in rainfall and temperature appear small compared with year-to-year variability. Nevertheless, the impacts on rangeland production systems are expected to be important in terms of required managerial and enterprise adaptations.Some important aspects of climate systems science remain unresolved, and we suggest that a risk-averse approach to rangeland management, based on the 'best estimate' projections, in combination with appropriate responses to short-term (1-5 years) climate variability, would reduce the risk of resource degradation.Climate change projections - including changes in rainfall, temperature, carbon dioxide and other climatic variables - if realised, are likely to affect forage and animal production, and ecosystem functioning. The major known uncertainties in quantifying climate change impacts are: (i) carbon dioxide effects on forage production, quality, nutrient cycling and competition between life forms (e.g. grass, shrubs and trees); and (ii) the future role of woody plants including effects of. re, climatic extremes and management for carbon storage.In a simple example of simulating climate change impacts on forage production, we found that increased temperature (3 degrees C) was likely to result in a decrease in forage production for most rangeland locations (e. g. -21% calculated as an unweighted average across 90 locations). The increase in temperature exacerbated or reduced the effects of a 10% decrease/increase in rainfall respectively (-33% or -9%). Estimates of the beneficial effects of increased CO2 (from 350 to 650 ppm) on forage production and water use efficiency indicated enhanced forage production (+26%). The increase was approximately equivalent to the decline in forage production associated with a 3 degrees C temperature increase. The large magnitude of these opposing effects emphasised the importance of the uncertainties in quantifying the impacts of these components of climate change.We anticipate decreases in LCC given that the 'best estimate' of climate change across the rangelands is for a decline (or little change) in rainfall and an increase in temperature. As a consequence, we suggest that public policy have regard for: the implications for livestock enterprises, regional communities, potential resource damage, animal welfare and human distress. However, the capability to quantify these warnings is yet to be developed and this important task remains as a challenge for rangeland and climate systems science.",,,,,15th Conference of the Australian-Rangeland-Society15th Conference of the Australian-Rangeland-Society,"SEP 28-OCT 02, 2008SEP 28-OCT 02, 2008",Australian Rangeland SocAustralian Rangeland Soc,"Queensland, AUSTRALIAQueensland, AUSTRALIA",141,8,0,0,72,2,156,,,1036-9872,1834-7541,,,,,,,,,,"US EPA, QCCCE, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, AustraliaDept Agr & Food Western Australia, S Perth, WA 6151, AustraliaUS EPA, QCCCE, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, AustraliaNT Dept Reg Dev Primary Ind Fisheries & Resources, Katherine, NT 0851, AustraliaCSIRO Climate Adaptat Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2601, AustraliaQueensland Dept Primary Ind & Fisheries, Anim Res Inst, Yeerongpilly, Qld 4105, AustraliaUniv Queensland, Ctr Remote Sensing & Spatial Informat Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, AustraliaCSIRO Climate Adaptat Flagship, PMB PO, Aitkenvale, Qld 4814, Australia",US EPAUS EPANT Dept Reg Dev Primary Ind Fisheries & Resources,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000264639900002,,

Recent research indicates that fertilization of the ocean with the macronutrients nitrogen and phosphorus where they limit primary production, may have sequestration advantages over fertilizing iron limited regions. Utilizing global datasets of oceanographic field measurements, and output from a high resolution global circulation model, the current study provides the first comprehensive assessment of the global potential for carbon sequestration from ocean macronutrient fertilization (OMF). Sufficient excess phosphate exists outside the iron limited surface ocean to support once-off sequestration of up to 3.6 Pg C by fertilization with nitrogen. Ongoing maximum capacity of nitrogen only fertilization is estimated at 0.7 +/- 0.4 Pg C yr(-1) . Sequestration capacity is expected to decrease from the upper toward the lower bound over time under continued intense fertilization. If N and P were used in combination the capacity is ultimately limited by societies willingness to utilize phosphate resources. Doubling current phosphate production would allow an additional 0.9 Pg C yr(-1) and consume 0.07% yr(-1) of known global resources. Therefore offsetting up to around 15% (1.5 Pg C yr(-1)) of annual global CO2 emissions is assessed as being technically plausible. Environmental risks which to date have received little quantitative evaluation, could also limit the scale of implementation. These results reinforce the need to consider a multi-faceted approach to greenhouse gasses, including a reduction in emissions coupled with further research into negative emissions technologies.",,,,,,,,,15,1,0,0,7,0,17,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Fac Sci, Marine Studies Inst, F09, Sydney, NSW 2006, AustraliaSydney Inst Marine Sci, 19 Chowder Bay Rd, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000413801900001,,

The key data libraries used were the Australian Life Cycle Inventory library, the ecoinvent library (with data adapted to Australian circumstances where appropriate) and data for timber production from an Australian study for a range of Australian forestry production systems and wood products. Two construction variations were assessed: the original intended construction, and a timber-maximised alternative. The indicator assessed was global warming, as the focus was on GHG emissions, and the effect of timber production, use and disposal on the fate of carbon.The timber maximised design resulted in approximately half the GHG emissions associated with the base designs. The sub-floor had the largest greenhouse impact due to the concrete components, followed by the walls due to the usage of bricks. The use of a timber maximised design offset between 23 and 25 % of the total operational energy of the houses. Inclusion of carbon storage in landfill made a very significant difference to GHG outcomes, equivalent to 40-60 % of total house GHG emissions. The most beneficial options for disposal from a GHG perspective were landfill and incineration with energy recovery.The study showed that significant GHG emission savings were achieved by optimising the use of wood products for two common house designs in Sydney.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Modelling and investigation of the effects of anthropogenic noise on the collective movement of animals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2016,2016,"There is increasing evidence that the wellbeing of marine and terrestrial animalsis affected by the exposure to anthropogenic noise (arising from variousindustrial activities; e.g., the Oil & Gas industry), which interferes with signalprocessing or animal communication, or can directly harm animals [1].A major issue regarding the anthropogenic noise is the difficulty of assessing itsimpact, and estimating behavioural effects on animals.The goal of this research is to use mathematical modelling, combined withanalytical techniques and available experimental data, to propose hypothesesregarding the effect of anthropogenic noise (e.g., generated by the Oil & Gasindustry) on the inter-individual communication between the members of small,medium or large animal aggregations. The project will see the development of2D multiscale mathematical models that describe the spatial interactionsbetween animals via sound signals (the models will be generalizations of modelsin [2,3]). To investigate the models developed in this project, various analyticaland numerical techniques will be used. For biological realism, the models will beparametrised with available data regarding animal movement (e.g., speed,turning behaviours) and animal communication (e.g., communication soundlevels, frequency). Finally, the models will be used to test the effect ofanthropogenic noise on disrupting group-level communication, and the potentialconsequences regarding the survival of individuals.This project will not only lead to the development of new computational andanalytical techniques to investigate these mathematical models, but will alsoincrease our understanding of the role of man-made noise on the biologicalmechanisms that disrupt animal movements and behaviour, and eventually leadto better mitigation methods to increase population survival.[1] A.A.

Here we explore evolving issues associated with produced water (PW) management and hydraulic fracturing water demands based on detailed well-by-well analyses. Our results show that although conventional wells produce, similar to 13 times more water than oil (PW to oil ratio, PWOR = 13), this produced water has been mostly injected back into pressure-depleted oil-producing reservoirs for enhanced oil recovery. Unconventional horizontal wells use large volumes of water for hydraulic fracturing that increased by a factor of similar to 10-16 per well and similar to 7-10 if normalized by lateral well length (2008-2015). Although unconventional wells have a much lower PWOR of 3 versus 13 from conventional wells, this PW cannot be reinjected into the shale reservoirs but is disposed into nonproducing geologic intervals that could result in overpressuring and induced seismicity.

The profile is interesting because soil development on mafic tephra produced a pattern of clay mineral and carbonate distribution. Carbonates precipitated abundantly, increasingly towards the bottom, making up 20-90 wt% of the soil. Sepiolite and calcite are dominant at the top, whereas palygorskite and dolomite are the major components at the lower part of the profile. Quartz is present in low amounts in most of the profile, and smectite and non-crystalline partially altered tephra occur in low amounts towards the bottom. Mineralogical, chemical and textural investigations indicate that sepiolite and calcite precipitated in the space between the original tephra grains, from Ca, Mg and Si dissolved in situ and transported in the runoff. Palygorskite and smectite precipitated within tephra grains, from in situ tephra weathering, as well as dolomite. The distribution of the clay minerals is due to clay composition and ion mobility. Sepiolite, consisting only of Si and Mg, precipitated outside tephra grains, where the mobile Si and Mg ions were abundant in the interstitial waters. Palygorskite and smectite contain Si, Al, Fe, and Mg and only precipitated within the tephra grains, where the immobile Al and Fe were available. Calcite precipitation in solution is kinetically favored over that of dolomite and thus calcite precipitated between the grains. Dolomite precipitated within altering tephra grains and spherical clay structures because tephra and clay generated a viscous medium where dolomite supersaturation increased and the kinetic barrier for precipitation was overcome. These results are relevant to the dolomite problem, as they illustrate how dolomite can precipitate in surface conditions, and to CO2 sequestration, because dolomite can immobilize higher CO2 amounts (both Ca and Mg are involved and not only Ca) and in a much more stable manner (dolomite is eight orders of magnitude less soluble than calcite).

However, pristine peat swamp forests are vanishing due to deforestation and peatland degradation, especially in Southeast Asia. CO2 emissions associated with this land use change might not only come from the peat soil directly but also from peat-draining rivers. So far, though, this has been mere speculation, since there has been no data from undisturbed reference sites. We present the first combined assessment of lateral organic carbon fluxes and CO2 outgassing from an undisturbed tropical peat-draining river. Two sampling campaigns were undertaken on the Maludam River in Sarawak, Malaysia. The river catchment is covered by protected peat swamp forest, offering a unique opportunity to study a peat-draining river in its natural state, without any influence from tributaries with different characteristics. The two campaigns yielded consistent results. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations ranged between 3222 and 6218 mu mol L-1 and accounted for more than 99% of the total organic carbon (TOC). Radiocarbon dating revealed that the riverine DOC was of recent origin, suggesting that it derives from the top soil layers and surface runoff. We observed strong oxygen depletion, implying high rates of organic matter decomposition and consequently CO2 production. The measured median pCO(2) was 7795 and 8400 mu atm during the first and second campaign, respectively. Overall, we found that only 32 +/- 19% of the carbon was exported by CO2 evasion, while the rest was exported by discharge. CO2 outgassing seemed to be moderated by the short water residence time. Since most Southeast Asian peatlands are located at the coast, this is probably an important limiting factor for CO2 outgassing from most of its peat-draining rivers.",,,,,,,,,45,3,0,0,26,0,48,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bremen, Inst Environm Phys, D-28359 Bremen, GermanyLeibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol, D-28359 Bremen, GermanyUniv Hamburg, Inst Geol, D-20146 Hamburg, GermanySwinburne Univ Technol, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Kuching 93350, Sarawak, MalaysiaForest Dept Sarawak, Petrajaya Kuching 93660, Sarawak, MalaysiaUniv Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Resource Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Sci, Kota Samarahan 94300, Sarawak, MalaysiaUniv Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000363182200005,,

Whereas the former part of the journal relates incidents of contact with natives of Shandong (山東) peninsular and Bohai (渤海) area amidst cold, harsh weather, and possibilities of shipwreck, the latter part of the journal relates contacts made and missionary works done in Hangzhou (杭州) bay area, where the weather and receptions by the natives were both much warmer. Gutzlaff had already visited Hangzhou bay area on his second voyage along China’s coast earlier the same year aboard the Lord Amherst of the British East India Company. A great part of accounts of Hangzhou bay area in his journal of the second voyage is focused on negotiations made with Chinese officials since the objective of the trip was to request the expansion of trade. In this journal of his third voyage, accounts regarding Hangzhou bay area and Zhoushan (舟山) archipelago are centered around missionary works among the common people and excursion into Putuo (普陀) island, which is one of the sacred places of Chinese Buddhism. What is noteworthy in Gutzlaff’s accounts of contacts with natives and his missionary works, is the recurring narrative of book distribution where the depiction of a welcoming crowd and their yearning for missionary books stand out. Such narrative although has the typical frame of present and reception between the West and the Rest, also at the same constructs a subject that moves proactively for its own salvation/enlightenment. And the fact that in the narrative the important medium of constructing that proactive subject is none other than literature/books is very important. It is quite interesting to see that Gutzlaff has foreseen recent perspective of the history of modern China, that it’s reform and revolution was a process of active learning and adapting by leading intellectuals and not a result of passive response.",,,,"본 역해는 선교사 카를 귀츨라프(Karl Gutzlaff, Charles Gutzlaff, 1803~ 1851)가 1832년 10월 20일부터 1833년 4월 29일까지 6개월여에 걸친 자신의 세 번째 중국연안 여행을 기록한 글의 후반부에 대한 번역과 주석, 그리고 해설이다. 이 글의 전반부가 산둥(山東) 반도와 보하이(渤海) 만 지역에서 혹한과 난파의 위험 속에 이루어진 현지인들과의 접촉을 서술하고 있다면, 후반부는 보다 온화한 기후의 항저우(杭州) 만 일원에서의 접촉과 선교활동을 기록하고 있다. 항저우 만 일원은 동인도회사 선박인 로드 암허스트(Lord Amherst) 호에 승선해 이루어진 두 번째 여행 때 들렀던 곳으로, 그때는 통상 타진이 주 임무였던 터라 관련 기록 역시 중국 관원들과의 갈등과 협상에 대한 내용이 주를 이루고 있는 반면, 세 번째 여행의 기록에서는 이 지역에서의 민간 선교에 관한 기술과 중국의 불교 성지 가운데 하나인 푸퉈산(普陀山)에서의 활동에 관한 기술이 주를 이루고 있다. 여기서 주목할 만한 점은 반복적으로 나타나는 ‘서적 배포 서사’로, 민간의 환영과 선교서적에 대한 열광적인 요청이 두드러진다. 이와 같은 서사는 전형적인 근대 서양과 비서양 지역 사이의 증여/시혜와 접수/감화라는 이야기 틀을 가짐과 동시에 구원/계몽을 향해 적극적으로 움직이는 주동적인 주체를 구성하고 있다. 특히 그와 같은 주체를 구성하는 매개가 글/서적이라는 점은 대단히 중요하다. 근대 중국의 개혁/혁명이 이식 혹은 수동적 반응의 결과가 아니며 선구적 식자층이 서구로부터 적극적, 주동적으로 배워 중국의 형편에 적응시킨 결과라는 최근의 중국 근대화 서사를 아편전쟁 이전에 귀츨라프의 여행기가 선취하고 있다는 점이 흥미롭다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1226-8100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-01-01,KJD:ART002311005,,

These cochlear devices could harness the unexploited Archimedean hydropower potential and kinetic tidal energy potential of Euripos Strait and Cephalonia's coastal paradox flow. For such innovative Archimedean turbines, an ongoing Ph.D. research has developed a very promising inventory of Greek Archimedean small hydropower potential, series of innovative experimental small-scale models of new cochlear wheels and their hydrodynamic performance prediction methods. The developed Greek Archimedean small hydropower potential inventory estimates that more than 30 TWh could be harnessed and proves that, there are thousands of very promising cochlear potential sites at small waterfalls and many river weirs across the country. Preliminary research efforts proved the useful exploitation of new screw techniques, under the form of innovative Archimedean Inclined Axis Cochlear Turbines (AIACT's) and innovative Archimedean Water Current Turbines (AWCT's) with horizontal floating cochlear rotors, harnessing the unexploited flowing hydraulic potential of natural streams, open channels hydraulic works, and coastal and tidal currents as well. These inclined and horizontal axis Archimedean screw rotors have been analyzed from fluid dynamics point of view, by using modern Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques, simulating the behavior of flowing water through the rotating Archimedean blades and investigating the hydrodynamic performances of the AIACT's and AWCT's.

Surface (2 m) and bottom (1537 m) waters, collected near the Deepwater Horizon site, were amended with 200 ppm light Louisiana sweet crude oil and bacterial inoculums from surface or bottom water, and incubated at 4 or 24 degrees C for 50 days. Bacterial community and residual oil were analyzed by pyrosequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. The results showed that temperature played a key role in selecting oil-degrading bacteria. Incubation at 4 degrees C favored the development of Cycloclasticus, Pseudoalteromonas, Sulfitobacter, and Reinekea, while 24 degrees C incubations enhanced Oleibacter, Thalassobius, Phaeobacter, and Roseobacter. Water chemistry and the initial community also had potential roles in the development of hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial communities. Pseudoalteromonas, Oleibacter, and Winogradskyella developed well in the nutrient-enriched bottom water, while Reinekea and Thalassobius were favored by low-nutrient surface water. We revealed that the combination of 4 degrees C, crude oil and bottom inoculum was a key factor for the growth of Cycloclasticus, while the combination of surface inoculum and bottom water chemistry was important for the growth of Pseudoalteromonas. Moreover, regardless of the source of inoculum, bottom water at 24 degrees C was a favorable condition for Oleibacter. Redundancy analysis further showed that temperature and initial community explained 57 and 19% of the variation observed, while oil and water chemistry contributed 14 and 10%, respectively.

Taking into account that renewable energy, solar and wind power particularly are very dependent on the climate, Hydro Power takes a new role in energy systems. Electricity conversion and storage in periods of lower consumption and electricity production from the stored energy in periods of higher demand or reduced production, are crucial for the maintenance of stable and efficient electrical system. This requirement has especially strengthened nowadays due to the expansion of integration of new wind and solar plants. These renewable sources are characterized with inherent intermittent production both in daily periods and periods of several days, weeks or even months. A number of technologies might be considered for the electricity conversion and storage, but the only nature and high capacity available technology is based on the pumped storage plants. This article studies the potential of the pumped storage plants as the effective and economically competitive technology for the storage of wind, solar, run-of-river and other environmentally friendly energies. Nuclear and coal fired plants can change power output to achieve demand but only at the price of extremely high maintenance cost. In addition, natural gas generators contribute to climate change and pollution only slightly less than coal. The pumped storage method is the most common storage system in the electricity sector. It is traditionally dependent on natural conditions, usually making use of rivers or lakes. However, some innovative methods such as the use of the sea as the lower reservoir, or a proposal to use a surface reservoir as the upper reservoir and an underground reservoir as the lower have emerged. Analyses indicate that there is a strong economic incentive for further investment in pumped-storage installations when other hydro storages and sites are not available.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1882-9554,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-27,KJD:ART002544372,,

Early in the most recent deglaciation, a reduction in North Atlantic overturning circulation seems to have driven CO2 release from the Southern Ocean(2-5), but the mechanism connecting the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean remains unclear. Biogenic opal export in the low-latitude ocean relies on silicate from the underlying thermocline, the concentration of which is affected by the circulation of the ocean interior. Here we report a record of biogenic opal export from a coastal upwelling system off the coast of northwest Africa that shows pronounced opal maxima during each glacial termination over the past 550,000 years. These opal peaks are consistent with a strong deglacial reduction in the formation of silicate-poor glacial North Atlantic intermediate water(2) (GNAIW). The loss of GNAIW allowed mixing with underlying silicate-rich deep water to increase the silicate supply to the surface ocean. An increase in westerly-wind-driven upwelling in the Southern Ocean in response to the North Atlantic change has been proposed to drive the deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2 (refs 3, 4). However, such a circulation change would have accelerated the formation of Antarctic intermediate water and sub-Antarctic mode water, which today have as little silicate as North Atlantic Deep Water and would have thus maintained low silicate concentrations in the Atlantic thermocline. The deglacial opal maxima reported here suggest an alternative mechanism for the deglacial CO2 release(5,6). Just as the reduction in GNAIW led to upward silicate transport, it should also have allowed the downward mixing of warm, low-density surface water to reach into the deep ocean. The resulting decrease in the density of the deep Atlantic relative to the Southern Ocean surface promoted Antarctic overturning, which released CO2 to the atmosphere.",,,,,,,,,68,4,0,0,17,0,76,,,0028-0836,1476-4687,,,,,,,,,,"ETH, Inst Geol, CH-8092 Zurich, SwitzerlandPrinceton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USAUniv Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USAUniv British Columbia, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, CanadaUniv Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, GermanyAlfred Wegener Inst, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany",,,,2013-03-28,WOS:000316682800042,23538831,

Very few studies have carried out simulations of the dispersion pattern and ground level concentration of pollutants emitted from real-world gas flares. The limited availability of official data on gas flares from the oil and gas industries makes accurate dispersion calculations difficult. Using ADMS 5 and AERMOD, this study assessed the sensitivity of dispersion and ground-level concentration of pollutants from gas flares in the Niger Delta to prevailing meteorological condition; fuel composition; and flare size. Although, during the non-WAM (West African Monsoon) months (November and March), the simulated ground-level concentrations of pollutants from a single flare are lower, the dispersion of pollutants is towards both the inland and coastal communities. In the WAM months, the ground-level concentrations are higher and are dispersed predominantly over the inland communities. Less buoyant plumes from smaller flares (lower volume flow rates) and/or flaring of fuel with lower heat content results in higher ground-level concentrations in areas closer to the flare. Considering the huge number of flares scattered around the region, a mitigation of the acute local pollution level would be to combine short stacks flaring at lower volume flow rates to enhance the volume flow rate of a single exhaust, and hence, the buoyancy of the plume exiting the stack.

Five days before the ship sank, the captain had reported to the maritime authorities that the old tanker was damaged and in trouble. During these five days leading up to the shipwreck, a crucial decision had to be made: what should be done with this dangerous oil tanker? Temporality is a property of the hazardous events which, after being noticed, are evaluated as imminent or deferred. This temporality makes a clear difference between a risk and a danger. Whereas the risk has time to anticipate the events, danger has just a very short time or even has no time. At this point, the Prestige disaster turns to be paradigmatic. To tow away this damaged oil tanker was a risk decision which estimated that there was still a time to prevent its running aground what meant to follow the story repeatedly told by the narrative context of risk. However, the Prestige had been spilling out oil all the time and the damage was not a probability but a fait accompli. This accident has not a risk temporality; in fact, it had not temporality at all because it demanded an immediate intervention. My conclusion here is that this crisis was managed in terms of risk when it should have been treated as a danger situation.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1366-9877,1466-4461,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Zaragoza, Dept Psychol & Sociol, Zaragoza, Spain",,,,2017-12-18,WOS:000417174600005,,

JOHN'S,,OCEANS-IEEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Proceedings Paper,2014,2014,"Upward-looking sonar (ULS) instruments have become the primary source of data for high resolution and long duration measurements of sea ice drafts to support engineering requirements for oil and gas exploration projects in Arctic and other ice-infested areas. ULS instruments, in the form of ASL's Ice Profiler Sonar (IPS), provide accurate measurements for ice draft on a continuous year-long basis and allow detailed characterization of keel shapes and other ice features. The IPS instrument was originally developed in the 1990' s and it was last upgraded by ASL Environmental Sciences Inc. in 2007-2008 through improved instrument design based on more capable microprocessors and more advanced on-board firmware.Another upgrade of the IPS instrument platform is presently underway with the design, testing and implementation of a logarithmic detector module in place of the previously used linear detector module which has been used for the past decade in the instrument. The linear detector module involves the use of an echo sounder detector which generates an analog voltage output from the raw transducer input supplied which is constant, i. e. independent of the time elapsed since the acoustic pulse was originally emitted. While this approach has proven reasonably serviceable, it has the disadvantage that the dynamic range of the instrument is curtailed from the alternative approach of using a logarithmic detector module which has previously been implemented in other ASL upward looking sonar instruments. The larger dynamic range of the log detector avoids using approximate TVG compensation. With the logarithmic sonar detector, the use of discrete threshold values for target detection is avoided and the resulting target detection capability is more robust.The project involved three principal components: (a) construction of a prototype 420 kHz log sonar card; (b) simulations of the response of the IPS log sonar instrument from previous IPS data sets which guided the development of operating firmware; and (c) assembly and field testing of a prototype IPS log sonar unit operated simultaneously with a standard IPS5. The simulations of the IPS5 log sonar outputs derived from previous standard IPS5 data indicate that there are occasional differences in the target detection for borderline cases, but they will not be significant. After iterations to improve the robustness of the target detection algorithm, development of the remaining functions of the IPS5 operating firmware was then carried out and further tested. Finally the prototype IPS5 log sonar instrument unit, along with a standard IPS5 instrument, was field tested in a deep open water environment (to 200 m water depth) in order to test the accuracy of the acoustic range of the sonar targets.",,,,,Oceans ConferenceOceans Conference,"SEP 14-19, 2014SEP 14-19, 2014",,"St Johns, CANADASt Johns, CANADA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4799-4918-2,,,,,,,,,"ASL Environm Sci Inc, Victoria, BC, Canada",ASL Environm Sci Inc,,,2014-01-01,WOS:000369848800136,,

These wetlands are in peril because Louisiana currently experiences greater coastal wetland loss than all other States in the contiguous United States combined. The analyses of landscape change presented here have utilized historical surveys, aerial, and satellite data to quantify landscape changes from 1932 to 2016. Analyses show that coastal Louisiana has experienced a net change in land area of approximately -4,833 square kilometers (modeled estimate: -5,197 +/- 443 square kilometers) from 1932 to 2016. This net change in land area amounts to a decrease of approximately 25 percent of the 1932 land area. Previous studies have presented linear rates of change over multidecadal time periods which unintentionally suggest that wetland change occurs at a constant rate, although in many cases, wetland change rates vary with time. A penalized regression spline technique was used to determine the model that best fit the data, rather than fitting the data with linear trends. Trend analyses from model fits indicate that coastwide rates of wetland change have varied from -83.5 +/- 11.8 square kilometers per year to -28.01 +/- 16.37 square kilometers per year. To put these numbers into perspective, this equates to long-term average loss rates of approximately an American football fields worth of coastal wetlands within 34 minutes when losses are rapid to within 100 minutes at more recent, slower rates. Of note is the slowing of the rate of wetland change since its peak in the mid- 1970s. Not only have rates of wetland loss been decreasing since that time, a further rate reduction has been observed since 2010. Possible reasons for this reduction include recovery from lows affected by the hurricanes of 2005 and 2008, the lack of major storms in the past 8 years, a possible slowing of subsidence rates, the reduction in and relocation of oil and gas extraction and infrastructure since the peak of such activities in the late 1960s, and restoration activities. In addition, many wetlands in more exposed positions in the landscape have already been lost. Most notable of the factors listed above is the lack of major storms over the past 8 years. The observed coastwide net stability in land area observed over the past 68 years does not imply that loss has ceased. Future disturbance events such as a major hurricane impact could change the trajectory of the rates. Sea-level rise is projected to increase at an exponential rate, and that would also expedite the rate of wetland loss.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-06-04,DRCI:DATA2019077015699212,,

Subsequently, the engine dual fuel model was further developed by considering the injection of two different fuels; methane in the cylinder inlet ports and pilot diesel fuel into the engine cylinders. The derived results were analysed for revealing the differences of the engine performance and emissions at each operating mode. In addition, the turbocharger matching was investigated and discussed to enlighten the turbocharging system challenges due to the completely different air fuel ratio requirements in the diesel and gas modes, respectively. Finally, parametric simulations were performed for the gas mode at different loads by varying the pilot fuel injection timing, the inlet valve closing and the inlet manifold boost pressure, aiming to identify the engine settings that simultaneously reduce the CO2 and NOx emissions considering the air fuel ratio operation window limitations.

The availability of these products has also coincided with increased grower adoption of changes to the sugarcane farming system including controlled traffic through wider row spacing and dual-row planting. To examine combinations of insecticide options, four trials were established in 2000. These trials evaluated potential options for improving grub control by combining suSCon (R) Plus with BioCane (TM) and the efficacy of combinations suSCon (R) Plus and BioCane (TM) in dual-row planted cane.

Effectiveness of plant-derived sorbent as a wicking agent was evaluated in microcosms simulating intertidal wetlands. Microcosms were designed to impose three different oil penetration depths (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 cm), two different tidal amplitudes (+/- 5 and +/- 10 cm above oil-contaminated surface), and two different types of sorbents (raw bagasse and hydrophobic-treated bagasse). We observed that the use of plant-derived sorbent was beneficial not only in removing oil but also in preventing further contamination. Oil penetration depth and tidal amplitude both negatively influenced the effectiveness of the sorbent. Effectiveness of the hydrophobic-treated sorbent was always higher than that of untreated one at any given oil penetration depth and tidal amplitude. Effectiveness of hydrophobic-treated sorbent was relatively low compared to that of raw bagasse. The most plausible explanation is that oil wicking mainly occurred during low tide. From a cost-effectiveness point of view, we suggest the use of raw bagasse immediately after an oil spill for remediation of low-energy intertidal wetlands.

Bioremediation of contaminated beach sand through landfarming is both simple and cost-effective to implement compared to other treatment technologies. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of alternative nutrients on biodegradation of crude oil contaminated beach sand in an effort to reduce the time required for bioremediation employing only indigenous hydrocarbon degraders.A natural sandy soil was collected from Agios Onoufrios beach (Chania, Greece) and was contaminated with weathered crude oil. The indigenous microbial population in the contaminated sand was tested alone (control treatment) or in combination with inorganic nutrients (KNO3 and K2HPO4) to investigate their effects on oil biodegradation rates. In addition, the ability of biosurfactants (rhamnolipids), in the presence of organic nutrients (uric acid and lecithin), to further stimulate biodegradation was investigated in laboratory microcosms over a 45-day period.Biodegradation was tracked by GC/MS analysis of aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons components and the measured concentrations were corrected for abiotic removal by hopane normalizations. It was found that the saturated fraction of the residual oil is degraded more extensively than the aromatic fraction and the bacterial growth after an incubation period of approximately 3 weeks was much greater from the bacterial growth in the control.The results show that the treatments with inorganic or organic nutrients are equally effective over almost 30 days where C-12-C-35 n-alkanes were degraded more than 97% and polyaromatic hydrocarbons with two or three rings were degraded more than 95% within 45 days. The results clearly show that the addition of nutrients to contaminated beach sand significantly enhanced the activity of indigenous microorganisms, as well as the removal of total recoverable petroleum hydrocarbons (TRPH) over a 45-day study period.

N. virginea was particularly tolerant to oil exposure, with the exception of a significant GSH depletion. Overall, enzymatic activities and oxidative damage in A. brasiliana and L. culveri were induced by frequent low-dosage spills compared to infrequent high-dosage spills, although the opposite pattern was observed for N. virginea antioxidant responses. Antioxidant responses in A. brasiliana and L. culveri were not affected by timing of exposure events. However, our results revealed that N. virginea might have a delayed response to acute high-dosage exposure. Experimental in situ simulations of oil exposure events with varying frequencies and intensities provide a useful tool for detecting and quantifying environmental impacts. In general, antioxidant biomarkers were induced by frequent low dosage exposures compared to infrequent high-dosage ones. The bivalve A. brasiliana and the polychaete L. culveri are more suitable sentinels due to their greater responsiveness to oil and also to their wider geographical distribution.

The results indicated that solidifier efficiency decreased substantially at the lower temperature, especially at lower application rates. The removal efficiency of the solidifier was in general directly proportional to temperature, except for the heavier oils, where removal by attachment was observed. Solidifier products with lower powder bulk density exhibited the best removal effectiveness. Analysis of experimental data yielded empirical correlations involving certain operational variables such as application rate, temperature, solidifier property (bulk density), and oil property (viscosity).

Plant litter, root exudates and microbial biomass can be used as C substrates to form organo-mineral complexes. Drought effects on plants and microbes could potentially compromise these relative stable soil C pools, by reducing plant C inputs and/or microbial activity. We conducted a 2-year drought experiment using rainout shelters in a semi-natural grassland. We measured aboveground biomass and C and nitrogen (N) in particulate organic matter (Pom), the organo-mineral fraction (Omin), and microbial biomass within the first 15 cm of soil. Aboveground plant biomass was reduced by 50% under drought in both years, but only the dominant C4 grasses were significantly affected. Soil C pools were not affected by drought, but were significantly higher in the relatively wet second year compared to the first year. Omin-C was positively related to microbial C during the first year, and positively related to clay and silt content in the second year. Increases in Omin-C in the second year were explained by increases in legume biomass and its effect on Pom-N and microbial biomass N (MBN) through structural equation modeling. In conclusion, soil C pools were unaffected by the drought treatment. Drought resistant legumes enhanced formation of organo-mineral complexes through increasing Pom-N and MBN. Our findings also indicate the importance of microbes for the formation of Omin-C as long as soil minerals have not reached their maximum capacity to bind with C (that is, saturation).",,,,,,,,,16,1,0,0,13,1,20,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Carbon Water & Food, 380 Werombi Rd, Camden, NSW 2570, AustraliaUniv Vienna, Dept Microbiol & Ecosystem Sci, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, AustriaEcole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, Lab Ecol Syst ECOS, CH-1015 Lausanne, SwitzerlandSwiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Site Lausanne,Case Postale 96, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",,,,2018-03-22,WOS:000426861900010,29540992,

It is poorly understood how differences in environmental conditions during oil exposure impact its toxicity. The present study investigated the effects of crude oil high-energy water accommodated fraction (HEWAF) on SHM reproduction in three environmental scenarios (normoxic, hypoxic, and hypoxic with low salinity) to determine if differences in salinity (brackish vs low salinity) and dissolved oxygen (normoxia vs hypoxia) could exacerbate the effects of HEWAF-derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We observed that HEWAF exposure significantly increased liver somatic index of SHM compared to control, but this effect was not exacerbated by hypoxia or low salinity. HEWAF exposure also significantly decreased egg production and egg fertilization rate, but only in the hypoxic and hypoxic with low salinity scenarios. A significant correlation existed between body burdens of PAHs and reproductive endpoints, providing substantial evidence that oil exposure reduced reproductive capacity in SHM, across a range of environmental conditions.

Biocathode MCL catalyzes the production of cathodic current coupled to carbon fixation through the activity of the uncharacterized Chromatiaceae, renamed as Candidatus Tenderia electrophaga, but the contribution of M. atlanticus is currently unknown. Here, we report on the electrochemical characterization of pure culture M. atlanticus biofilms grown under aerobic conditions and supplemented with succinate as a carbon source at applied potentials ranging from 160 to 510 mV vs. SHE, and on three different electrode materials (graphite, carbon cloth, and indium tin oxide). M. atlanticus was found to produce either cathodic or anodic current that was an order of magnitude lower than that of the Biocathode MCL community depending on the oxygen concentration, applied potential, and electrode material. Cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and square wave voltammetry (SWV) were performed to characterize putative redox mediators at the electrode surface; however no definitive redox peaks were observed. No effect on current was observed when genes encoding a putative rubredoxin (ACP86_RS07295), as well as a putative NADH:flavorubredoxin oxidoreductase (ACP86_RS07290), were deleted to evaluate their role in EET. The addition of either riboflavin or excess trace mineral solution increased anodic current by ca. an order of magnitude under the conditions in which Biocathode MCL is typically grown. These results indicate that M. atlanticus has a non-negligible ability to utilize electrodes as an electron acceptor, which can be enhanced by the presence of excess trace minerals already available in the growth medium. The ability of M. atlanticus to utilize trace minerals as electron shuttles with extracellular electron acceptors may have broader implications for its natural role in biogeochemical cycling.

Among renewable energies, carbon neutral biofuels frommicroalgae appear to be a promising move towards sustainability and cleaner fuels owing to its attributes of high CO2-sequestering capability, high lipid productivity and being easily cultivable in an open pond and waste/marine/brackish water. However, the commercial viability of algae-based fuels suffers mainly from the cost incurred during the process. Among the steps involved in the biodiesel production from microalgae, lipid extraction in particular consumes not only a significant amount of energy and time but also causes environmental contamination by usage of toxic solvents. Conventional solvents used in lipid extraction process may further aggravate the quality of the product by dissolving other compounds like chlorophyll that may lead to erroneous results of lipid content. To circumvent the problem, green solvents and process intensification methods/techniques (green extraction technologies) potentially improve the characteristics of energy reduction, eco-friendliness, non-toxicity and efficient lipid extraction. Hence, this review focuses on the prospects of green solvents and extraction techniques that could improve the commercial viability of biodiesel production. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

This investigation aimed to develop indices of environmental vulnerability to oil (IEVO), by combining information about environmental sensibility to oil and results of numerical modeling of spilled oil. To achieve that, a case study concerning to oil spills scenarios in a subtropical coastal area was designed, and IEVOs were calculated and presented in maps, in order to make the information about the areas' vulnerability more easily visualized. For summer, the extension of coastline potentially affected by oil was approximately 150 km, and most of the coastline presented medium to high vulnerability. For winter, 230 km coastline would be affected, from which 75% were classified as medium to high vulnerability. Thus, IEVO maps allowed a rapid and clearer interpretation of the vulnerability of the mapped region, facilitating the planning process and the actions in response to an oil spill.

These are the first TTCESPs deployed inside of 7-in. casing. Electrical submersible pumps (ESPs) are a form of artificial lift that consists of a pump, motor, and electric cable, typically deployed by a rig and connected to electric power at surface. Their advantage is that they create greater drawdown than other forms of artificial lift, thus achieving higher production rates. However, conventional ESPs require expensive workover rigs to replace pumps, the component that fails most frequently. ConocoPhillips Alaska developed TTCESP technology to replace failed pumps rapidly and economically. In this system, a rig conventionally deploys the electric cable, motor, and seal sections with a special latching device for the pump. The pump is pulled and replaced with slickline (wireline) or coiled tubing, eliminating the requirement of a rig.The original through-tubing-conveyed (TTC) systems were developed for 75/8-in.-cased wells. During approximately the past 10 years, it was common belief that they could not be deployed at the Milne Point field in Alaska because of the limitations of its smaller wells (7-in., 26-lbm/ft casing). This paper discusses the enabling technologies that were developed to allow running TTCESPs in 7-in, casing, including a wellhead spoolpiece and low-clearance ESP clamps.West Sak TTCESP run-time data indicate that the time between rig workovers (RWOs) will increase from 3.5 to 6 years. Pumps can be replaced for 5-10% of rig costs without the safety and environmental impacts associated with rigs. Additionally, production impacts while waiting for a rig are eliminated because slickline and coiled-tubing units are readily available on the North Slope of Alaska. TTC pumps can easily be upsized or downsized to optimize pump flow rate because of changes in production rates. This technology is of interest in areas where rig costs are high, including Arctic, remote, and offshore locations. It is also beneficial where rig availability is low.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1930-1855,,,,,,,,,,,"Baker Hughes, SPE, Houston, TX 77019 USA",,,,2011-12-21,WOS:000297240400003,,

Field measurements of water table, salinity, and tracer (lithium) concentration were obtained for around a week during the summer of 2008. The numerical model MARUN was used to simulate the field observations. On the basis of field experiments and numerical simulations, the beach was identified to have a two-layered hydraulic structure: a high-permeability surface layer underlain by a low-permeability lower layer. The hydraulic conductivity was found to be 5 x 10(-2) m s(-1) for the surface layer and 7 x 10(-6) m s(-1) for the lower layer. The simulations reproduced the observed water table, salinity, and lithium concentrations accurately. The small flow entering the beach from the land side resulted in a beach water table dropping below the interface of the two layers. This seems to be the major reason for the presence of oil in the lower layer. The exchange flow between the beach and the sea due to tidal influence was similar to 2.12 m(3) d(-1) m(-1). The patterns of inflow and outflow rates showed that the maximum seawater-groundwater exchange occurred in the middle to high intertidal zone, which explains the persistence of oil in the lower intertidal zone. To explore bioremediation of the beach with nutrient amendment, a numerical simulation of nutrient application on the beach surface was conducted, where the applied nutrient concentration was 5,000 mg L(-1). The results showed that the nutrient concentration remaining in oiled areas after a week was larger than 50 mg L(-1), which is larger than that needed for maximum microbial growth (2-10 mg L(-1)). This implies that the bioremediation via nutrient application on the beach surface could be adopted if nutrients were the only limiting factor.",,,,,,,,,49,6,0,0,21,0,58,,,0043-1397,,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies & Biogeol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R ChinaTemple Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USAChina Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Geosci, Environm Geol Lab, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",,,,2010-10-16,WOS:000283100700003,,

In subsea DC transmission and distribution, wet-mate (WM) connectors are considered as a challenging component due to the complicated electrical field distribution in the insulation system and harsh undersea wet-mating environmental conditions. In order to design reliable liquid insulation systems for subsea connectors, it is essential that the behavior of the DC-stressed liquid insulation be fully characterized for thorough understanding. In this paper, liquid conduction phenomena in synthetic ester oil are studied using the current-voltage characteristics and electric field distribution mapping based on the Kerr electro-optic effect. The correlations between the current-voltage characteristics and DC field grading among different electrode gaps and oil types were analyzed. The experimental results suggest that for applied voltage less than the saturation voltage (V-s), the conduction is dominated by ion dissociation in the bulk oil. Correspondingly, the liquid conduction is ohmic and with formation of heterocharges around the contacts giving symmetrical field distribution. At applied voltage higher than saturation voltage (V-s), this bulk conduction will transit to extrinsic dominated conduction with carriers injected through liquid-electrode interfaces. Under such carrier injection, the corresponding field distribution becomes asymmetrical. In addition to the laboratory experiments, computer simulations with an ion drift-diffusion conduction model taking into account electrode injection were carried out to validate the experimental field distribution at different electrode gaps. The effect of electrode material on the electric field distribution in the oil is investigated and implications for wet-mate connector design principles are presented.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1070-9878,1558-4135,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Connecticut, Inst Mat Sci, Elect Insulat Res Ctr, 97 North Eagleville Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USAUniv Connecticut, Elect & Comp Engn, 97 North Eagleville Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USAVirginia Tech, ECE Dept, 1185 Perry St, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USAGE Global Res Ctr, Niskayuna, NY 12309 USA",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000446866400013,,

Time-series of chi(CH4), delta C-13-CH4, and delta D-CH4 in ambient air were analysed using the Keeling plot method.

Analysis of isotope and wind data indicated that (i) emissions from off-shore oil and gas platforms in the North Sea were not detected during this period, (ii) CH4 from fossil fuel related sources was usually advected from the east, pointing towards the Groningen gas field or regions further east in Germany. The results from two atmospheric transport models, CHIMERE and FLEXPART-COSMO, using the EDGAR v4.3.2 and TNO-MACC III emission inventories, reproduce chi(CH4) variations relatively well, but the isotope signatures were over-estimated by the model compared to the observations. Accounting for geographical variations of the delta C-13 signatures from fossil fuel emissions improved the model results significantly. The difference between model and measured isotopic signatures was larger when using TNO-MACC III compared to EDGAR v4.3.2 inventory.

In the 1980s, techniques were developed to model systems by means of binary trees, which did not allow for the representation of the context in which human actions occur. Thus, these techniques cannot model the representation of individuals, their interrelationships, and the dynamics of a system. These issues make the improvement of methods for Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) a pressing need. To eliminate or at least attenuate these limitations, some authors have proposed modeling systems using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs). The application of these tools is expected to address many of the deficiencies in current approaches to modeling human actions with binary trees.This paper presents a methodology based on BBN for analyzing human reliability and applies this method to the operation of an oil tanker, focusing on the risk of collision accidents. The obtained model was used to determine the most likely sequence of hazardous events and thus isolate critical activities in the operation of the ship to study Internal Factors (IFs), Skills, and Management and Organizational Factors (MOFs) that should receive more attention for risk reduction.

The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have been adopting innovations and policies in order to diversify their economies and decrease environmental degradation. After decades of high demographic and economic growth, balancing ecological concerns and the need for more dynamic growth have now become cornerstones of those countries' national, urban, and infrastructure planning strategies. This review article introduces the ecological modernization in the GCC region through innovations and reforms. Such a pathway might be a viable model for other oil- and gas-rich economies. The review outlines the current model in the GCC region for achieving a low-carbon future through interventions in the built environment, deployment of renewables, technological investments, and gradual integration in knowledge-intensive global industries. On the other hand, the review points to mixed results with regards to megaprojects and the still existing barriers to adoption of renewables. The obstacles in addressing large environmental footprints and fossil fuel dependency are evaluated. Overall, modernization policies in the Gulf region are still emerging, are rather supply-side focused, and are implicitly driven by the idea of technological primacy. At the same time, in an effort to develop local capacities, policymakers seek to promote comparatively high-potential sectors and maintain the region's global image as a crossroads of trade and modernity.This article is categorized under:The Carbon Economy and Climate Mitigation > Decarbonizing Energy and/or Reducing DemandTrans-Disciplinary Perspectives > Regional Reviews",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,6,0,25,,,1757-7780,1757-7799,,,,,,,,,,"Qatar Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Doha, QatarUniv Appl Sci, Tech Hsch Koln, Inst Technol & Resources Management Trop & Subtro, Cologne, Germany",Univ Appl Sci,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000435286300009,,

By accounting for regional and temporal differences in the relationship between wind speed and reservoir inflow behavior during wind farm site selection, the benefits of energy diversification can be maximized. The goal of this work was to help maximize the value of wind power by quantifying the long-term (30-year) relationships between wind speed and streamflow behavior, using British Columbia (BC) and the Pacific Northwest (PNW) as a case study. Clean energy and self-sufficiency policies in British BC make the benefits of increased generation during low streamflow periods particularly large. Wind density (WD) estimates from a height of 10m (North American Regional Reanalysis, NARR) were correlated with cumulative usable inflows (CUI) for BC (collected from BC Hydro) for 1979-2010. The strongest WD-CUI correlations were found along the US coast (r similar to 0.55), whereas generally weaker correlations were found in northern regions, with negative correlations (r similar to -0.25) along BC's North Coast. Furthermore, during the lowest inflow years, WD anomalies increased by up to 40% above average values for the North Coast. Seasonally, high flows during the spring freshet were coincident with widespread negative WD anomalies, with a similar but opposite pattern for low inflow winter months. These poorly or negatively correlated sites could have a moderating influence on climate related variability in provincial electricity supply, by producing greater than average generation in low inflow years and reduced generation in wet years. Wind speed and WD trends were also analyzed for all NARR grid locations, which showed statistically significant positive trends for most of the PNW and the largest increases along the Pacific Coast.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,7,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",,,,2015-09-02,WOS:000359492800104,26271035,

These geochemical tools are used to estimate source type, maturity and depositional environment, and as a correlation technique. In many cases the natural gas signatures in near-surface samples and drill cuttings can be used to classify or predict a deeper lying source rock or reservoir.Corresponding interpretative schemes for coals, Type III kerogens and their associated hydrocarbons are progressing quickly. The shift in attention to humic sources is driven primarily by depletion of conventional oil and gas resources and the economic and societal requirements of coal and coal-bed methane.Carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen stable isotope variations can be large between different coals and humic kerogens. These differences can often be recognized in their bulk delta(13)C(org), delta D-org and delta(15)N(org) values. Isotope signatures of coals can be diagnostic of several factors, including deposit age, type, geographic location, maturity and generation history. However, these characteristic isotopic variations are substantially better defined by the C-, H- and N-isotope ratios of the separate maceral groups, such as vitrinite, exinite and inertinite. This new application of stable isotopes, at the maceral and compound levels, have great potential to improve the interpretative precision over conventional whole coal or bulk techniques.Hydrocarbon gases, including coal gases, derived from coals and humic kerogens can be distinguished from Type I/II sources, based on their molecular ratios, i.e., C-1/(C-2 + C-3) and by comparing their stable isotope compositions, especially C-13(CH4) and delta D-CH4. The delta(13)C(C2H6) can also be valuable, but ethane is generally present in small amounts (< 1 vol.%) and requires measurement by Gas Chromatography-Combustion-Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). in certain cases delta(15)N(N2) in coal or humic gases is a diagnostic parameter. Combinations of these parameters are useful to identify mixtures of different sources and maturities, and to recognize secondary alteration effects or artifacts (e.g., bacterial oxidation, gas sorption by coals and kerogens).

The total organic carbon (TOC) contents of the Paleogene to Neogene source rocks range from 0.43% to 6.11%, with an average TOC value of 1.00%, indicating fair to very good source-rock potential. The Paleogene Ghaydah and Umm Er Radhuma source rocks are relatively higher in genetic petroleum potential than Neogene Sarar source rocks. Mainly oil and gas are anticipated from the Ghaydah and Umm Er Radhuma source rocks with hydrogen index (HI) values ranging from 95 to 715 mg hydrocarbon (HC)/g TOC. This is supported by the presence of significant amounts of liptinite macerals in the Ghaydah and Umm Er Radhuma source rocks. The Sarar source rocks are dominated by vitrinitic type III kerogen (HI < 200 mg HC/g TOC) and are thus considered to be gas source rocks. The Paleogene to Neogene source rocks have vitrinite reflectance (R-o) values in the range between 0.30% and 0.77% R-o, and pyrolysis maximum temperature values range from 412 degrees C to 444 degrees C (774 degrees F to 831 degrees F), consistent with the immature to early mature oil window.

This article will briefly analyze the current global warming problem and propose a method that we apply algae cultivation to absorb carbon and use shellfish to sequestrate it. Despite the importance of decreasing CO2 emissions or developing carbon-free energy sources, carbon sequestration should be a key issue, since the amount of carbon dioxide that already exists in the atmosphere is great enough to cause global warming. Algae cultivation would be a good choice because they have high metabolism rates and provides shellfish with abundant food that contains carbon. Shellfish's shells, which are difficult to be decomposed, are reliable storage of carbon, compared to dead organisms like trees and algae. The amount of carbon that can be sequestrated by shellfish is considerable. However, the sequestrating rate of algae and shellfish is not high enough to affect the global climate. Research on algae and shellfish cultivation, including gene technology that aims to create super plants and super shellfish, is decisive to the solution. Perhaps the baton of history will shift to gene technology, from nuclear physics that has lost appropriate international environment after the end of the Cold War.

These electronic microdevices have significantly reduced power requirements but at the same time require more attention in terms of integrated thermal management and power management and distribution. Micro thermoelectric converters are considered a promising technology approach for meeting some of these new requirements.Thermoelectric microdevices can convert rejected or waste heat into usable electric power, at moderate (200-500K) temperatures and often with small temperature differentials. They can also be easily integrated and provide effective cooling for devices specific in optoelectronics, such as mid-IR lasers, dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) components and charge-coupled-device (CCD) detectors.In the Materials and Device Technology Group at JPL, we have developed a unique fabrication method for a thermoelectric microdevice that utilizes standard integrated circuit techniques in combination with electrochemical deposition of compound semiconductors (Bi2Te3/Bi2-xSbxTe3). Our fabrication process is innovative in the sense that we are able to electrochemically micro mold different thermoelectric elements, with the flexibility of adjusting geometry, materials composition or batch scalability. Successive layers of photoresist were patterned and electrochemically filled with compound semiconductor materials or metal interconnects (Au or Ni). A thermoelectric microdevice was built on either glass or an oxidized silicon substrate containing 63 couples (63 n-legs/63 p-legs) at approximately 20 microns in structure height and with a device area close to 1700 mum x 1700 mum. In cooling mode, we evaluated device performance using an IR camera and differential thermal imaging software. We were able to detect a maximum cooling effect of about 2K. in power generation mode, a 75 watt light source was illuminated directly above the device while the current generated was measured.

Panagiotopoulos The project supports attendance of U.S. researchers at the Properties and Phase Equilibria for Product and Process Design (PPEPPD) international conference this coming May, 2016 in Porto, Portugal. The PPEPPD conference is the premier worldwide conference in the area of molecular thermodynamics as related to chemical process and product design. By subsidizing airfare for attendance of both senior and junior academic researchers at the conference, the award will foster exchange of scientific ideas and the latest advances in this important area of chemical research focusing on thermophysical properties and phase equilibrium data needed to lower costs and improve efficiencies across a broad spectrum of chemical products and processes. PPEPPD 2016 will bring together international researchers in the application of molecular thermodynamics to industrially relevant product and process design. The conference will provide a forum for interactions between both junior and senior researchers at the cutting edge of techniques for thermophysical properties and phase equilibrium measurement and estimation, and identify the challenges in the growing areas of alternative energy resources and storage, gas and oil upstream and downstream processing, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, marine and saline systems and processes, nanotechnology, and sustainability. One of the primary goals of PPEPPD is to provide interaction between academic, government, and industrial researchers on how molecular thermodynamics (experimental and computation) can benefit real-world industrial product and process design. The meetings are the most important gatherings for molecular thermodynamicists from all over the world - typically attracting 200-300 participants from North America, South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The topics selected by the International Organizing Committee of the 14th PPEPPD include both fundamental aspects of molecular thermodynamics (thermodynamics and transport properties, surfaces, interfaces and confinement effects, quantum calculations and force fields, and molecular and multiscale simulations),and applied aspects (product and process engineering, gas and oil downstream and upstream processes, alternative energy resources and storage, environmental processes, sustainability and risk management, carbon capture and storage, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, food processing, agrochemicals and biomass, marine and saline systems, materials, and nanotechnology). The purpose of PPEPPD is the sharing of state-of-the-art techniques to further product and process design that will fuel world-wide economic growth in the chemical and related industries, and allow the modeling of new separation processes for meeting lower greenhouse gas emission goals. U.S. participation is essential for making contributions to the general knowledge base, for building awareness of global activities, and for fostering international collaboration. The requested funding would provide air fare support for a few senior invited U.S. lecturers and members of the international organizing committee, but will mainly provide support for approximately 16 young researchers who would not be able to attend without such support. From an educational standpoint, this represents a unique opportunity for young attendees to network with peers from around the world and experience the latest worldwide perspective on research trends in the areas of thermodynamics, transport properties, phase equilibria, etc. as related to a broad range of chemical processes and products.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1624141,,,,,,,,Princeton University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13888668,,

Especially for deep-water fields electrical heating of pipeline systems is attractive. Norwegian oil companies have since 1986 been investigating alternative electrical heating methods for prevention of hydrates and wax plugging the pipelines. A joint industry project 'Concept Verification - Direct Heating of Oil & Gas Pipelines' was initiated in 1996 and terminated in October 1999. During this-work the electrical heating system was proved to be feasible on; several fields in the North Sea and is installed on 7 flowlines of 13% chromium (Cr13) material with a length between 6 km and 16 km. The work is continued to implement electrical heating of rigid steel risers. Flexible risers with hot water heating - IPB (integrated Production Bundles) - have been developed and tested for application in shallow and deep water. Electrical heating of flexible risers is being reviewed in the present programme. Different configurations of steel risers are studied with individual and simultaneous heating of random selected risers. Some development work of cable and connector technology is scheduled for application in 2000 m water depth.The single-phase power supply to the heating system is based on commercially available components and connected to the platform power supply. Application of a frequency converter is evaluated for optimising the heating system.The electrical heat is used to maintain or raise the thermally insulated steel riser temperature above the critical value for hydrate (typically 15 - 25 degrees C) or wax formation (typically 20 - 40 degrees C). Both heating during,planned shutdowns and continuous heating are evaluated. Melting of plugs are considered, but must be handled carefully due to differential pressure problems.Measurements performed on pipe joints during the earlier qualification program confirm that the magnetic characteristic may vary within a wide range for a specific steel quality and that mechanical stress and heat treatment can effect the magnetic characteristic. These data are not common available.The difference in magnetic characteristic of individual Cr13 risers results in variation of the riser temperature and problems concerning differential pressure during melting of hydrate plugs. The problem can be handled by sorting the pipes for the individual risers prior to welding.As a part of the specification for steel risers both electrical and magnetic characteristics should be available. These characteristics may be determined by a simple measuring arrangement in the production line of the mill. It may be possible to restrict the variations of the magnetic characteristics through a modification of the production process.",,,,,10th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE-2000)10th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE-2000),"MAY 28-JUN 02, 2000MAY 28-JUN 02, 2000",Int Soc Offshore & Polar EngnInt Soc Offshore & Polar Engn,"SEATTLE, WASEATTLE, WA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1098-6189,,1-880653-48-6,,,,,,,,,"Coflexip Stena Offshore Norge AS, Lysaker, Norway",Coflexip Stena Offshore Norge AS,,,2000-01-01,WOS:000089401700007,,

This study will focus on the unwanted shutdown of aero derivative gas turbine causes by variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) issue that affects the production reliability. In modern days, the health of gas turbine is monitored by complex predictive instrumentation and control system, which normally focus direct on individual physical sensor operational alarm limit such as Variable inlet guide vane deviation above hi alarm limit and not on failure mode such as Variable inlet guide vane system drifted outside normal operating envelope. Hence, understanding the relationship between independent variables or predictor versus dependent or response variables and having a failure mode virtual sensor is the key factor to improve the variable inlet guide vane predictive monitoring by developing a failure mode virtual sensor. Based on the study, the failure mode virtual sensor is capable to predict the expected operating condition of the variable inlet guide vane at a steady state condition. This is measured by stability and normality analysis and error simulation using offline data. From the results analysis, which supported by hypothesis testing, it can be determined that failure mode virtual sensor could be used to predict the potential failure of variable inlet guide vane at the steady state, by comparing the deviation between the expected value from the virtual sensor model versus the actual value from the control panel. The detected deviation, which provides an early detection or a warning mechanism, will help to improve the maintenance planning and operability actions ahead.

The intense use of fossil fuel burning, such as mineral coal and oil, brings with it health problems with the increasing of air pollution and environmental degradation related to climate change. In this context, the search for renewable energy sources has been intensifying, with consequent rise of the participation from these sources in the energy matrix. Solar and wind energy are the most known in these panel, however, the study about ocean energy has also been increasing. In this branch, energy can be generated by waves, tides, thermal gradients and ocean currents. The present project aims to study tidal energy, having as specific objective the optimization of a tidal turbine located in a canal, where there are blockage effects. For the realization of this study, it will be developed a numerical method based on CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). In a first moment, computational simulation will be realized reproducing the flow around the turbine with forced rotation. With the data collected, a comparative analysis and validation with the literature will be performed in order to implement the model with free rotation. Subsequently, a comparison will be done between the turbine performance in situation with blockage and without, and in the end, develop turbine geometries for these two conditions in order to optimize your efficiency.

Major and minor accidents in this industry cause losses of lives and result in financial and reputational losses. The first step to reduce accidents and losses in this industry is identification and assessment of the attended risks. After this, the risks can be prioritized in terms of their importance, and then proper long-term strategies to reduce the accidents can be identified and implemented. In this article, with a study of past research and accident statistics and reports, and using standards checklists and expert opinion, significant HSE risks in Iranian drilling industry were identified and assessed with a new structured method. The result of scrutiny of the 60 identified risks showed that management, human and hardware are, respectively, the most important influential factors in accident causation. The results of the assessment of the 20 most important risks also showed that the level of the most of these risks, despite existing controls, was still in unacceptable area. It is expected that with implementation of the controls proposed in this research, the risks will be reduced to an acceptable level. The priority of the strategies to reduce incidents in Iranian drilling industry should be development of long-term strategic plans for implementation of the proposed controls.

The conservation state of ivory, determined by prolongated immersion in a marine environment, was established by a multi-technique methodology: light microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy X-ray microanalysis (FESEM-EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), spectrophotometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The analyses demonstrated that the structure and composition of both tusk parts, namely the inner ivory and outer cementum, were altered due to characteristic diagenetic processes of a marine environment. Ca enrichment was observed in both tusk parts, which gave higher Ca/P molar ratio values than for ideal hydroxyapatite. Mg leaching was observed, together with uptake of exogenous elements (F, Cl, Si, Al, S, Na, Fe, Cu, Sr, Pb, Sn, Ag, V, Ni, Cd and Zn), which were prevalently identified in the external tusk part. Uptake of S and Fe was associated with the neoformation of pyrite framboids. The high carbonate content measured by FTIR, which agreed with the higher Ca/P ratios found in the archaeological tusk, was ascribed to the carbonate substitution of phosphate groups (type-B) in the bioapatite accompanied by some authigenic calcium carbonate that infilled ivory. An increased degree of crystallinity was observed when comparing the values of several crystallinity indices found in the archaeological bioapatite with those of a modern tusk, used as the reference material. Increased crystallinity prevalently took place in the cementurn. In accordance with increased crystallinity, the HPO42- content index indicated that the hydrated layer of bioapatite nanocrystals diminished in the archaeological tusk, and prevalently in the cementum. All these changes correlated with the significant organic matter loss reported for the archaeological tusk. Interestingly, remaining collagenous matter noticeably altered with enrichment in glycine and depletion in acid amino acids. Changes in the secondary structure of proteins were also recognised and associated with collagen gelatinisation. In addition to proteinaceous materials, small amounts of long-chain fatty acids, monoglycerides and cholesteryl oleate were identified by GC-MS. Cholesteryl oleate was associated with blood, which could have precipitated at the time of specimen death.

As a result, changes in IFT affect the displacement efficiency and the residual oil saturation having direct impact on the Recovery Factor. Fluids in Pre-salt fields (offshore Brazil) have particular characteristics, such as high salinity in the brines, elevated content of asphaltenes and resins in the oils and high CO2 content in the produced gas for some fields. The effect of CO2 on the IFT depends on complex electrostatic and acid-base equilibria, and cannot be predicted by a single fluid property. This work presents the experimental study of the effect of CO2 dissolution on the IFT between a Pre-salt oil with a high total base number (TBN) and non-negligible total acid number (TAN) and a high salinity brine using the pendant drop technique. The oil and its asphaltenic fraction were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and elemental analysis identifying characteristic functional groups and indicating both acidic and basic polar functional groups. CO2 dissolution resulted in an IFT increase of 56% evidencing that, despite the high TBN of this oil, basic groups have low surface-activity. Moreover, a study of IFT as a function of pH showed that the maximum IFT was found in strongly acidic environments, but constant IFT values were obtained at neutral and basic pH values. Thus, the interfacial activity is governed by asphaltenes and resins with polar groups of varying acid/base behavior. The presence of CO2 also accelerated the dynamic behavior of IFT reducing the equilibrium time by 70%. This is caused by the reduction of oil viscosity, which impacts the relaxation time and enhances the diffusion of surface-active species towards the interface. The results in this work evidence that the CO2 content should be considered when modeling fluid properties for this type of reservoirs, as it affects the oil-brine IFT. In addition, for this oil with high content of surface-active compounds and non-negligible TAN and TBN, CO2 flooding does not contribute to reduce the IFT. Therefore, the efficiency of this Enhanced Oil Recovery technique in this type of field relies on viscosity reduction, miscible displacement and wettability alteration rather than IFT reduction.",,,,,,,,,22,1,0,0,1,1,23,,,0920-4105,1873-4715,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, LRAP Enhanced Oil Recovery Lab, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,,,2020-05-27,WOS:000531623500005,,

Previous research suggests that intermodal transport might lead to emissions savings when traffic is shifted from high- to low-emission vehicles. This study aims to test this hypothesis by comparing intermodal truck-ferry routes and road-only routes within Scandinavia. The environmental performance of 66 routes in eight transport corridors was assessed in terms of carbon footprint using methods, databases, and software from the Life Cycle Assessment domain. To improve the robustness of the comparison between alternative routes, stochastic error propagation was applied to obtain a distribution of carbon footprint values for each route and pairwise statistical tests were performed between these distributions. Shifting freight traffic on ferries leads to emission reductions which size depends on the route, ferry type, and fuel used. Long distance routes by sea must sensibly cut road distance to allow for net emission reductions. The use of ferries transporting cargo only and of liquefied natural gas-powered ferries is highly preferable to the use of ferries carrying both cargo and passengers and of diesel ferries. The results can support the decision making of different stakeholders within the freight transport sector interested in lowering their carbon footprint. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The performance of the proposed model is demonstrated by simulating kick control operation and compared their results with a single-phase linear model. The results confirm that the single-phase model underestimates key well control parameters (including kick size, bottomhole pressure and choke pressure), which may be due to ignoring gas-phase flow behaviour on mud density and the choke valve performance. Additionally, the performance of the proposed model is tested by validating the gas kick simulation results from a lab-scale MPD setup and a gas kick event from a field's case study based on North Sea drilling operation.

Seawater intrusion has the potential to cause the corrosion of underground cavern facility and leakage of gas and oil from the storage caverns, therefore, seawater intrusion into the underground storage caverns should be evaluated carefully to avoid unexpected operation problems. In this study, the extent of seawater intrusion into underground oil storage cavern in Yeosu, Korea, was assessed through field monitoring and numerical modeling to evaluate the storage cavern sustainability against seawater intrusion. The mean values of seawater mixing ratios of seepage water in each cavern, estimated through modeling, range from 0.01 to 8.70 %, which are less than the measured mixing ratio (2.3-12.8 %) based on the Cl- concentrations. This result indicates that other source of Cl- may have contributed to the observed salinity in the cavern seepage water. Spatial and temporal variations in monitoring data and numerical modeling demonstrate that the location of storage, seepage water flow rate, and the fracture zones are important factors controlling seawater mixing ratio.

Importing shale gas in the form of LNG from Canada is one such pathway. It starts with the recovery of shale gas in Canada and its export to China. This paper quantifies well-to-wire (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per kilowatt hour (kWh) of Canadian shale gas-fuelled electricity in China through models. WTW emissions include emissions from recovery, processing, transmission, liquefaction, marine shipping, re-gasification, power plant operations, and electricity transmission and distribution. Four Canadian shale gas reserves - Montney, Horn River, Liard, and Cordova - are considered. The results show that the WTW GHG emissions of Canadian shale gas-fired combined cycle technology range from 567 to 610 gCO(2)/kWh (57-62% of the GHG emissions from China's present coal-fired electricity), and total well-to-port (WTP) GHG emissions (emissions from recovery, processing, and transmission to a liquefaction facility) range from 7.68 to 13.4 gCO(2e)/MJ. Sensitivity analysis results show that venting emissions during raw gas processing, flaring rates during well completion, and lifetime productivity of the gas significantly influence WTP emissions.

However, the application of traditional geochemical and isotopic methods to infer temperatures of mineralization, the nature of mineralizing fluids, and the mechanisms controlling the transformation of dissolved CO2 into magnesium carbonates in these settings is difficult because the fluids are usually not preserved. Clumped-isotope compositions of magnesium carbonates provide a means to determine primary mineralization or (re) equilibration temperature, which permits the reconstruction of geologic processes that govern magnesium carbonate formation. We first provide an evaluation of the acid fractionation correction for magnesium carbonates using synthetic magnesite and hydromagnesite, along with natural metamorphic magnesite and low-temperature hydromagnesite precipitated within a mine adit. We show that the acid fractionation correction for magnesium carbonates is virtually indistinguishable from other carbonate acid fractionation corrections given current mass spectrometer resolution and error. In addition, we employ carbonate clumped-isotope thermometry on natural magnesium carbonates from various geologic environments and tectonic settings. Cryptocrystalline magnesite vein deposits from California (Red Mountain magnesite mine), Austria (Kraubath locality), Turkey (Tutluca mine, Eskisehir district) and Iran (Derakht-Senjed deposit) exhibit broadly uniform Delta(47) compositions that yield apparent clumped-isotope temperatures that average 23.7 +/- 5.0 degrees C. Based on oxygen isotope thermometry, these clumped-isotope temperatures suggest mineralization at shallow crustal depths in the presence of meteoric water. Hydrous magnesium carbonates from a 400-km latitudinal transect along the serpentinized-peridotite bodies of the California Coast Ranges record clumped-isotope temperatures between 14.2 and 22.7 +/- 2.8 degrees C, in agreement with historical maximum temperatures during the rainy season for California. Talc-carbonate alteration of ultramafic rocks in Greenland (Isua Supracrustal Belt) and Vermont (Ludlow) yields clumped-isotope alteration temperatures of magnesite and dolomite between 326 and 490 degrees C, broadly consistent with paragenesis and thermodynamic analysis for CO2 metasomatism of ultramafic rocks. These metamorphic carbonates extend the applicability of clumped-isotope thermometry to high-temperature magnesium carbonate systems and indicate equilibrium blocking temperatures for magnesite of similar to 490 degrees C. Our study demonstrates the applicability of the clumped isotope approach to provide information on the formation of magnesium carbonates as ore resources, surface records of climate, and metamorphic assemblages.

Taking into account that renewable energy, solar and wind power particularly are very dependent on the climate, Hydro Power takes a new role in energy systems. Electricity conversion and storage in periods of lower consumption or available excess production, and electricity production from the stored energy in periods of higher demand or reduced production, are crucial for the maintenance of stable and efficient electrical system. This requirement has especially strengthened nowadays in the world due to the expansion of integration of new wind and solar plants. These renewable sources are characterized with inherent intermittent production both in daily periods and periods of several days, weeks or even months.A number of technologies might be considered for the electricity conversion and storage, but the only nature and high capacity available technology is based on the pumped-hydro storage plants. This article studies the potential of the pumped storage plants as the effective and economically competitive technology for the storage of wind, solar, run-of-river and other environmentally friendly energies, as well as energy from other conventional thermal plants including nuclear. Nuclear and coal fired plants can change power output to achieve demand but only at the price of extremely high maintenance cost. In addition, natural gas generators contribute to climate change and pollution only slightly less than coal. The pumped storage method is the most common storage system in the electricity sector. It is traditionally dependent on natural conditions, usually making use of rivers or lakes. However, some innovative methods have emerged in recent years, such as the use of the sea as the lower reservoir, or a proposal to use a surface reservoir as the upper reservoir and an underground reservoir as the lower. Analyses indicate that there is a strong economic incentive for further investment in pumped-storage installations when other hydro storages and sites are not available.",,,,,29th IAHR Symposium on Hydraulic Machinery and Systems (IAHR)29th IAHR Symposium on Hydraulic Machinery and Systems (IAHR),"SEP 16-21, 2018SEP 16-21, 2018",Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res; Turbomachinery Soc JapanInt Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res; Turbomachinery Soc Japan,"Kyoto, JAPANKyoto, JAPAN",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1755-1307,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Univ Belgrade, Fac Mech Engn, Kraljice Marije 16, Belgrade 11000, Serbia300 Webb Dr 1411, Mississauga, ON L5B 3W3, CanadaUniv Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, CanadaAcad Engn Sci Serbia, Kraljice Marije 16, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",Acad Engn Sci Serbia,,,2020-09-03,WOS:000560282603009,,

Soils in southeastern United States have lost much of their original soil organic carbon (SOC) as a result of intensive row-cropping systems. One example is an annual rotation of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) under conventional tillage (CT). Incorporation of perennial grasses such as bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Fluegge) into the peanut-cotton crop rotation (also called a forage-crop rotation or FCR) can increase SOC storage. Cattle (Bos sp.) grazing on bahiagrass and winter cover crops can improve productivity of the FCR system, but may result in increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study evaluates the impact of a grazed FCR on SOC storage and GHG emissions to assess its environmental impact of Coastal Plain soils. A closed chamber method was used to examine emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O in the FCR. Results indicated that the FCR has potential to increase SOC storage when conservation tillage is used. Grazing of bahiagrass reduced SOC in the 5- to 10-cm depth, but this effect was not observed in the subsequent peanut crop in the rotation following grazing. A moderate stocking rate of 2.5 cattle ha(-1) resulted in fewer emissions of CO2 and N2O during seasonal measurements compared with ungrazed management, dependent on location, season, and crop. Flux of CH4 was often negligible; however, grazing increased soil uptake of CH4 in some instances.

Recent measurements have shown that the LNG offloading process had the largest contribution to methane emissions in the refueling portion of the supply chain. However, there are limited studies analyzing the LNG offloading process for small-scale applications. This study investigates six methods used to offload LNG from a tanker truck to an LNG refueling station and their contribution to methane emissions. A verified thermodynamic model is created by comparing numerical results with the experimental data collected from an LNG offloading process in a refueling station. The modeling results show that the LNG transfer by using a pressure buildup unit causes methane emissions as high as 104 g/kg LNG. In contrast, LNG transfer by using a pump and controlled pressure buildup unit provides the lowest risk of methane venting. Also, the results of parametric study indicate that rigid foam insulation can be considered as an economical alternative to vacuum jacketed pipes in LNG refueling stations.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,0,14,,,1359-4311,1873-5606,,,,,,,,,,"Univ British Columbia, Clean Energy Res Ctr, 2360 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada",,,,2019-10-24,WOS:000488423600085,,

Increased pressures from extreme climatic events and invasive pests and pathogens pose major threats to the future stability of C storage in indigenous forests through elevated canopy-tree mortality. We assessed the potential for interspecific differences in wood decay resistance to moderate decadal-scale net C losses following canopy tree mortality. We recorded tree mortality, growth and recruitment over a period spanning almost 40 years in repeatedly surveyed plots spanning a wide range of mortality rates. We combined these survey data with national data on species-specific wood decay resistance (i.e. retention of wood density) to estimate contemporary C lost through decay of trees that died during our study. We also included C losses from CWD contributed by a major synchronous mortality event before the study period (legacy CWD C loss) for a subset of the plots where CWD C storage measurements were available. C flux from live to dead biomass (1.36 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), s.e. 0.16) was the main factor influencing estimated net contemporary changes in C storage, with the largest net contemporary C losses (-1.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) observed in plots experiencing high mortality. Estimated net contemporary C loss from tree mortality was reduced when the dominant species had highly decay-resistant wood. The ability to predict contemporary changes in C was significantly improved when a plot-level indicator of CWD decay resistance was included in multiple regressions. Mean legacy CWD C loss was 0.39 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), s.e. 0.16. When legacy losses were incorporated in net C change estimates, both the size of the legacy CWD pool and its interaction with legacy CWD decay resistance explained a significant amount of variation in net C change in multiple regressions. In plots losing large (around 3 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) amounts of C from live biomass (or with more than 300 Mg ha(-1) C stored in legacy CWD at the start of the study) wood decay resistance altered the net C balance by as much as 1.11 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), which is a considerable effect given that the mean annual C assimilation rate across plots was 1.38 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). Thus, our study reveals strong potential for interspecific variation in decay resistance to moderate the impact of canopy tree mortality on C storage in forests. We suggest that research effort on wood decay rates should be prioritised toward areas, such as drought-prone regions of Amazonia, where forests are likely to experience synchronous mortality events more frequently in future.

Samples were collected from the borewells, and observations were made that included parameters such as odor, moisture, contamination characteristics, lithology, groundwater level, thickness of the free product that are used to demarcate the extent of soil, and water contamination. Furthermore, a multigas detector was used to detect hydrocarbon presence as soil vapor. Moreover, to capture the transport of dissolved hydrocarbons, 10 samples were collected in the periphery of the study area and were analyzed for the presence of petroleum hydrocarbon and polyaromatic hydrocarbon. Analysis of the data indicated the presence of free-phase hydrocarbon in soil and groundwater close to the junction of Thiruvottiyur high (TH) road (TH) and Varadaja Perumal Koil (VPK) street. Although the contaminant plume is confined to a limited area, it has spread more to the southern and eastern side of the pipeline possibly due to continuous abstraction of groundwater by residential apartments. After cutting a trench along the VPK street and plotting of the plume delineation map, observations indicated that the source of the hydrocarbon leak is present in VPK street close to TH road.

The findings demonstrate that is possible to eliminate or reduce the oxidizing action of water, thereby extending the allowable time before painting after hydrojetting, and that the new corrosion inhibitor technology does not interfere with the final quality of paint adhesion.Design/methodology/approach - Metallic specimens were treated/washed by hydrojet (35000 Psi). It was employed as a 2 per cent V-active VCI SPH 1,712 water solution by dilution of the inhibitor in industrial water. Metal sample plates were examined after blasting and after subsequent drying, and were submitted to the paint adhesion tests, to evaluate the duration of temporary protection, oxidation prevention and influence on the adherence of paint (pull off).Findings - Using the V-active VCI proposed technology, it was possible to minimize or eliminate the oxidizing action of the water when the metal is exposed to the saline moisture in a closed environment, extending the acceptable time before painting without interference in the final quality of painting.Practical implications - The proposed technology allows to the area of prepared (wet blasted) steel surface to be increased during cleaning and preparation, thereby reducing labor and product costs, and reduces water consumption during the preparation process. Practical applications in the shipbuilding, ship maintenance and oil and gas production industries, include the preservation of internal tubes and pipes, protection during hydrostatic test processes and cleaning with water and corrosion prevention in diesel tanks contaminated with water.Originality/value - The intent of this paper is to present the obtained results for a new formulation of organic chemical inhibitors that use water medium as the application method. In addition to this property, this group of organic inhibitors maintains the property of volatile inhibitors.

Clear discrimination was observed with flow cytometer provided with 375 or 405 nm lasers in addition to the standard 488 nm laser necessary to identify phytoplankton. Using this method, we measured the relationship between the percentages of phytoplankton organisms with PAHs, with the decrease in the growth rate.

Differential expression analysis revealed that 1641 and 2142 genes were significantly up- and down-regulated. Enrichment analysis identified a set of GO terms and putative pathways involved in the response of P. olivaceus to WAF exposure. Analysis of the transcripts revealed the effective protective mechanisms of P. olivaceus to reduce the toxic effects of WAF. Moreover, WAF exposure induced the metabolism of energy substrates, and downstream pathway genes were modified to provide protection against toxic damage. Transcripts analysis demonstrated that the genes involved in circadian rhythm signaling were regulated in gills of P. olivaceus exposed to WAF.

We estimate the effect of incorporating H on tropics-wide forest biomass estimates in 327 plots across four continents using 42 656 H and diameter measurements and harvested trees from 20 sites to answer the following questions:1. What is the best H-model form and geographic unit to include in biomass models to minimise site-level uncertainty in estimates of destructive biomass?2. To what extent does including H estimates derived in (1) reduce uncertainty in biomass estimates across all 327 plots?3. What effect does accounting for H have on plot- and continental-scale forest biomass estimates?The mean relative error in biomass estimates of destructively harvested trees when including H (mean 0.06), was half that when excluding H (mean 0.13). Power- and Weibull-H models provided the greatest reduction in uncertainty, with regional Weibull-H models preferred because they reduce uncertainty in smaller-diameter classes (< 40 cm D) that store about one-third of biomass per hectare in most forests. Propagating the relationships from destructively harvested tree biomass to each of the 327 plots from across the tropics shows that including H reduces errors from 41.8 Mg ha(-1) (range 6.6 to 112.4) to 8.0 Mg ha(-1) (-2.5 to 23.0). For all plots, aboveground live biomass was -52.2 Mg ha(-1) (-82.0 to -20.3 bootstrapped 95% CI), or 13%, lower when including H estimates, with the greatest relative reductions in estimated biomass in forests of the Brazilian Shield, east Africa, and Australia, and relatively little change in the Guiana Shield, central Africa and southeast Asia. Appreciably different stand structure was observed among regions across the tropical continents, with some storing significantly more biomass in small diameter stems, which affects selection of the best height models to reduce uncertainty and biomass reductions due to H. After accounting for variation in H, total biomass per hectare is greatest in Australia, the Guiana Shield, Asia, central and east Africa, and lowest in east-central Amazonia, W. Africa, W.

Thus, if tropical forests span 1668 million km(2) and store 285 Pg C (estimate including H), then applying our regional relationships implies that carbon storage is overestimated by 35 Pg C (31-39 bootstrapped 95% CI) if H is ignored, assuming that the sampled plots are an unbiased statistical representation of all tropical forest in terms of biomass and height factors.

For each step in the dispersion process, we review available experimental data in order to identify overall trends and propose an algorithm or calculation method. Additionally, the conditions for successful mechanical and chemical dispersion are defined.Two commonly identified key parameters in surface oil dispersion are: oil properties (viscosity and presence of dispersants) and mixing energy (often wind speed). Strikingly, these parameters play a different role in several of the dispersion sub-processes.

Concentrated solar power solar tower with thermal energy storage such as Crescent Dunes, or concentrated solar power solar tower without thermal energy storage but boost by natural gas combustion such as Ivanpah are disregarded for the higher costs, the performances well below the design, and the extra difficulties for the specific location such as temperatures, humidity and sand/dust that suggest the use of an enclosed trough.

Insights into the effects of rock composition on pore structure can aid understanding of the storage and migration mechanisms of shale gas in a reservoir. To investigate the compositional effects on pore structure, a combination of geochemical and petrophysical experiments were conducted on four bulk shale samples and their corresponding extracted organic matter (OM) and clay mineral samples. The experimental results show that the removal of OM using H2O2 during clay mineral extraction oxidizes and removes pyrite and siderite from the samples while other inorganic phases remain unaffected. OM hosted more abundant micropores compared with clay minerals, while mesopores and fine-macropores are dominant in clay minerals. Effects of the OM and clay minerals on pore volume and surface area are quantitatively evaluated on the basis of weight-normalized poresize distribution (PSD) curves of extracted OM and clay mineral samples. In terms of the CO2 adsorption, contribution from OM and clay minerals to micropore volume (MIV) are 19.43-32.92% and 18.75-39.05% respectively, and to micropore surface area (MIS) are 19.30-32.28% and 16.42-35.72%. Other minerals (other than organic matter and clay minerals) account for 34.29-48.93% of the MN and 39.75-52.98% of the MIS. N-2 adsorption results reveal that the pore volume and surface area are mainly attributable to the clay minerals, providing 54.37-80.75% of the BJH pore volume (BJHV) (average 65.83%) and 70.68-87.04% of the BET surface area (BETS) (average 78.71%). The primary medium for pore development in marine shale is OM, whereas pores in the transitional shale are mostly found in the clay and other inorganic minerals. Therefore, the hydraulic fracturing design and drilling-related operations involved in the exploitation of transitional shale gas should be appropriately adjusted and improved in order to accommodate intrinsic characteristics of the transitional shale gas reservoir.",,,,,,,,,11,1,0,0,0,0,11,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Geosci Beijing, Beijing 100083, Peoples R ChinaNatl Energy Shale Gas R&D Expt Ctr, Langfang 065007, Hebei, Peoples R ChinaPetroChina Res Inst Petr Explorat & Dev, Beijing 100083, Peoples R ChinaGreat Wall Drilling Co, China Natl Petr Corp, Sichuan Shale Gas Dept, Panjin 124040, Liaoning, Peoples R China",Natl Energy Shale Gas R&D Expt Ctr,,,2019-12-13,WOS:000498747500040,,

Low area mass density spunbond nylon is capable of sorbing more than 16 times its mass in low viscosity crude oil and more than 26 times its mass in higher viscosity gear lube oil. Nylon bags separated more than 95% of gear lube oil contaminate from a 4.5% oil-in-water emulsion. Field testing of spunbond nylon fences by oil spill first responders has demonstrated the ability of this material to contain the oily contaminate while allowing water to flow through.

This cost level is similar to or even lower than the cost level for CO2 removal for new coal fired power plants. Global Co-2 emissions could be reduced by 4%, Japanese CO2 emissions could be reduced by 6.5% (80 Mt/yr) in case this option were applied to its full extent by the iron and steel industry.

Jordan is considered one of the driest countries in the world, which poses an additional challenge for oil shale development, because a vast quantity of water is needed for this process. El-Lajjun study area is located in central Jordan; the oil shale in the study area was deposited in marine environment; it comprises massive beds of brown-black, kerogen-rich, bituminous chalky marl. Ten representative oil shale rock samples were collected for risk assessment investigations from different localities of oil shale exposures. A standardized laboratory Fischer assay test delivered oil shale characteristics. Sequential extraction was used to evaluate mobility and distribution of the trace elements Ti, V, Cr, Co, Zn, As, Zr, Cd, Pb, and U. Column leaching experiments were performed to simulate the leaching behavior of the above elements from oil shale and spent shale to evaluate the possible negative impact on groundwater in the study area. Results of sequential extraction indicate that concentration of trace elements and trace elements are richer in oil shale and in the spent shale compared to most rocks and soils.

Its ability to mix and disperse energy or mass (like chemicals or particles) plays a key role in every day applications, like flows in oil and gas pipelines, in industrial reactors, in mixing, in heating or cooling, as well as in the atmosphere and in oceans. The goal of this project is to understand the effects of flow features that are commonly observed in turbulent flow on the transport of energy and mass using advanced computational techniques. The findings of this research could lead to efficient energy management, efficient design of industrial equipment where heat and mass transfer take place, and better prediction and control of pollutant dispersion. The database generated through this project will become available to the scientific community, and simulation data generated through this project will be used to develop animations of turbulent dispersion that can be used in K-12 science demonstrations. Central concerns for the development of a comprehensive turbulent transport theory have been the prediction of the spatial variation of turbulent viscosity, the effect of molecular dispersion on turbulent transport, and the effect of coherent velocity structures on the transport properties. The main hypothesis here is that the reason for the failure in predicting scalar transfer from momentum transfer is that only some of the velocity structures participate in turbulent transfer close to a wall, and the range of scales that participate in the transfer depends on molecular dispersion effects. Main questions to be answered are what is the role the very large scales of motion (known as VLSM) in turbulent transport, and how the interplay between molecular diffusion and convection affects mixing or separation of particles in anisotropic turbulence. The proposed approach is to use computations with Lagrangian methods for analysis, which afford the study of a range of fluids that span several orders of Prandtl number in magnitude (e.g., liquid metals, gases, refrigerants, and electrochemical fluids) making it possible to handle cases where conventional methods are often not feasible with the current supercomputers. Expected results could lead to the development of a comprehensive model for the prediction and control of turbulent transport.

Currently agricultural activities contribute a significant portion (approximately 20%) of global anthropogenic GHG emissions, and agricultural soils have been identified as one of the main GHG source categories within the agricultural sector. However, compared to many other GHG sources, inventory methods for soils are relatively more complex and have been implemented only to varying degrees among member countries. This review summarizes and evaluates the methods used by Annex 1 countries in estimating CO, and N2O emissions in agricultural soils. While most countries utilize the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default methodology, several Annex 1 countries are developing more advanced methods that are tailored for specific country circumstances. Based on the latest national inventory reporting, about 56% of the Annex 1 countries use IPCC Tier I methods, about 26% use Tier 2 methods, and about 18% do not estirnate or report N2O emissions from agricultural soils. More than 65% of the countries do not report CO2 emissions from the cultivation of mineral soils, organic soils, or liming, and only a handful of countries have used country-specific, Tier 3 methods. Tier 3 methods usually involve process-based models and detailed, geographically specific activity data. Such methods can provide more robust, accurate estimates of emissions and removals but require greater diligence in documentation, transparency, and uncertainty assessment to ensure comparability between countries.

As part of the project objective of developing methodologies to detect, locate, and quantify potential leakage of the stored fluid into the atmosphere, we formulate an inverse atmospheric model based on a Bayesian probabilistic framework coupled to a state-of-the-art backward Lagrangian particle dispersion model. A Markov chain Monte Carlo method is used for efficiently sampling the posterior probability distribution of the source parameters. Controlled experiments used to test the model involved releases of the injected fluid from one of the nearby wells and were staggered over 1 month. Atmospheric measurements of CO2 and CH4 concentrations were taken at two stations installed in an upwind-downwind configuration. Modeling both the emission rate and the source location using the concentration measurements from only two stations is difficult, but the fact that the emission rate was constant, which is not an unrealistic scenario for potential geological leakage, allows us to compute both parameters. The modeled source parameters compare reasonably well with the actual values, with the CH4 tracer constraining the source better than CO2, largely as a result of its 6 times higher signal-to-noise ratio.

Cost-efficiency is a crucial criterion for the achievement of such targets, requiring analyses of all possible options. Enhancing the oceanic carbon sink via ocean iron fertilization (OIF) provides such an option. Our analysis reveals that the critical unit costs per net ton of CO2 sequestered by OIF range from 22 to 28 USD (price level 2000) in a post-Kyoto compliance scenario. The critical unit costs are defined as those that would make an emitter indifferent between various abatement options. With reference to hypothetical short-term large-scale Southern Ocean OIF we are able to show that seven years of OIF provide a number of credits exceeding those obtainable from global forestation projects lasting 20 years. From an economic perspective, our results indicate that OIF can be considered a potentially viable carbon-removal option.

Therefore, the detection of CO2 and/or entrained contaminants that migrate into shallow groundwater aquifers is important both to assess storage permanence and to evaluate impacts on water resources. Naturally occurring elements (i.e., Li, Sr) in conjunction with isotope ratios can be used to detect such leakage. We propose the use of laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) as an analytical technique to detect a suite of elements in water samples. LIBS has real time monitoring capabilities and can be applied for elemental and isotopic analysis of solid, liquid, and gas samples. The flexibility of probe design and use of fiber optics make it a suitable technique for real time measurements in harsh conditions and in hard to reach places. The laboratory scale experiments to measure Li, K, Ca, and Sr composition of water samples indicate that the technique produces rapid and reliable data. Since CO2 leakage from saline aquifers may accompany a brine solution, we studied the effect of sodium salts on the accuracy of LIBS analysis. This work specifically also details the fabrication and application of a miniature ruggedized remotely operated diode pumped solid state passively Q-switched laser system for use as the plasma excitation source for a real time LIBS analysis.

This method of sequestering CO2 overcomes the major limitations of sequestering appreciable CO2 using existing technologies, such as microalgae cultured in open ponds, photobioreactors, or continuous bioreactors on land or near shore. Open ponds require vast surface areas and generally have low net productivity due to light and temperature limitations during the night and winter periods. Continuous algal bioreactors are much more productive, but this comes at the expense of controlling the parameters of the bioreactors, such as light regimes and temperature. The additional energy inputs used to control the parameters of the bioreactors negate their effectiveness of sequestering CO2 on a global scale. Near shore photobioreactors lack the capacity to be scaled up to sequester appreciable CO2. Alternatively, we propose that atmospheric CO2 and/or the flue gases (containing CO2, NOx and SOx) can be collected and transferred to enclosed vessels or bags containing algal cultures situated in the open-oceans. The productivity of the enclosed cultures could be optimized by moving the bags to various locations in the oceans, allowing for control of temperature, irradiance, and hours of daylight.Theoretical calculations using demonstrated CO2 sequestration efficiencies and production rates of microalgal batch cultures suggest that 4 cylindrical enclosures, each with a diameter of 100 m and a depth of 40 m would be able to sequester the CO2 emitted by a 500 MW coal-fired generating plant. On a grander scale, using the same CO2 consumption rates and the enclosures described above, roughly 14,000 enclosures could reduce the CO2 in the troposphere by 1 ppm on a yearly basis, representing half of the total CO2 added to the atmosphere annually.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,0,6,,,1364-0321,,,,,,,,,,,"Thompson Rivers Univ, Open Learning Div, Kamloops, BC V2C 0C8, CanadaThompson Rivers Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Kamloops, BC V2C 0C8, CanadaUniv Alberta, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, CanadaMIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Thompson Rivers UnivThompson Rivers Univ,,,2018-04-10,WOS:000428613200006,,

Although forest management may have substantial impacts on soil C storage, experimental data from forest harvesting studies have not been synthesized recently. To quantify the effects of harvesting on soil C, and to identify sources of variation in soil C responses to harvest, we used meta-analysis to test a database of 432 soil C response ratios drawn from temperate forest harvest studies around the world. Harvesting reduced soil C by an average of 8 +/- 3% (95% CI), although numerous sources of variation mediated this significant, overall effect. In particular, we found that C concentrations and C pool sizes responded differently to harvesting, and forest floors were more likely to lose C than mineral soils. Harvesting caused forest floor C storage to decline by a remarkably consistent 30 +/- 6%, but losses were significantly smaller in coniferous/mixed stands (-20%) than hardwoods (-36%). Mineral soils showed no significant, overall change in C storage due to harvest, and variation among mineral soils was best explained by soil taxonomy. Alfisols and Spodosols exhibited no significant changes, and Inceptisols and Ultisols lost mineral soil C (-13% and -7%, respectively). However, these C losses were neither permanent nor unavoidable. Controls on variation within orders were not consistent, but included species composition, time, and sampling depth. Temporal patterns and soil C budgets suggest that forest floor C losses probably have a lesser impact on total soil C storage on Alfisols, Inceptisols, and Ultisols than on Spodosols, which store proportionately large amounts of C in forest floors with long C recovery times (50-70 years). Mineral soil C losses on Inceptisols and Ultisols indicate that these orders are vulnerable to significant harvest-induced changes in total soil C storage, but alternative residue management and site preparation techniques, and the passage of time, may mitigate or negate these losses. Key findings of this analysis, including the dependence of forest floor and mineral soil C storage changes on species composition and soil taxonomic order, suggest that further primary research may make it possible to create predictive maps of forest harvesting effects on soil C storage.

The External Albanides are subdivided into distinct tectonic-stratigraphic units: the Kruja zone (shallow carbonate water) in the east and the Ionian zone in the west, which is represented by pelagic limestone. The Ionian zone, located between the Sazan (Pre-Apuliane) and Kruja zones, consists of three anticlinal belts: the Berati, Kurveleshi and Cika anticlinal belts. Their western margin is bordered on overthrust faults, which have produced large westward overthrusts on each of them, with amplitudes of 10-30 kms, and are utilized through a large diapir masses. Therefore, they mask perspective plays in subthrusts. The Berati anticlinal belt is the most eastern in the Ionian zone and lies mostly in the Albanian territory and partly in the Greek territory. It has a length of about 225 kms and a width 12-22 kms, and is differentiated into two sectors: the southern sector (south of the Qafa Kicoku) and the northern sector (north of the Qafa Kicoku). Understanding the evolution of evaporite tectonics is important in determining the principal features of the structural model on the Berati anticlinal belt. The changes in the lithostatic pressure on the space have a greater role in the development of evaporite tectonics, which are conditioned by the deposition thickness of the cover sediments above the evaporites and the presence of weak tectonic loops. These loops belong to the intersecting places of transverse and longitudinal fault generated since the rifting phase (T3-Cr1). Such intersecting places are the Dumrea (Albania) and Zavrohon (Greece) on the surface. We stress that evaporites are also extended over regional thrust faults of the Berati belt, helping its over-thrusting westward about 20-30 km (depicted by seismic and deep wells data). The tectonic evaporite effect differs from the expansion of the Berat thrust belt. Thus, in its southern part, as a result of a diapirism that has not emerged on the surface, it is helping orogenies in developing large fan-type anticline structures (Golika, Nemercka, Mitsikeli anticlines, etc.), that have backthrusts in their eastern flank. Moreover, we encountered the presence of a carbonate massive in the middle of the Epiro-Akarnani syncline (e.g. Timfeu massive in Greece), caused by the blind evaporite body effect. The northern sector (north of Qafa e Kicoku), is characterized by a smaller evaporite effect, which is reflected in increasing density of the anticlinal structures on the surface units and their normal passing to each other. The Dumrea diapir is a considerable ellipsoid-shape evaporite mass outcropping with a surface area of about 210 km(2) and axes 20 9 10 km. It is an ordinary diapir with a westward overthrust (20-30 km). Most oil fields in Albania are in carbonate sections (Cr2-Pg2) in the anticline structures delivered to the thrust of adjacent units. There is another new prospect of the high perspective: The carbonate structures under overthrust of different units (subthrust complex) of the Ionian zone. The subthrust in the Ionian zone is divided into three types: 1. The subthrust beneath overthrust of thrust belts. These overthrusts are related to the evaporite detachment horizon, and they mask folded structures of subthrust. 2. The subthrusts beneath the overthrusts of the anticline units.These overthrusts have a local character and they are more developed in the Kurveleshi thrust belt. 3. The subthrusts beneath the overthrusts of the tectonic zones of the orogenetic front (Ionian and Kruja Zones) above the western autochthonous (Apulian Platform and South Adriatic Basin). These structures display duplex and triplex style. Currently, the more interesting opportunity lies in the subthrust beneath the Berati thrust belt. This has a higher perspective than the other subthrusts beneath the Kurvelesh and Cika anticlinal belts. Actually, the Berati subthrust is in the processes of being the subject of a seismic survey and exploration drilling. The discovery of a new oil field in the subthrust of the Berati anticlinal belt, with drilling of the Shpiragu-2 well, which in the first test gave 800-1300 barrels (light oil with density 35-37 degrees API) and 2-5 mmcfd gas per day, is of great importance for the entire tectonic ensemble of the Dinaric-Albanid-Hellenic. The presence of prospective structures such as the Dum-rea anticline in the north and its continuation southward (the Shpiragu oil field, Molishti anticline, etc.), beneath the thrust belt, as shown by both drilling and seismic data, together with the presence of the surface structures (e.g. the Kasidhiaris, Kurenton and Thesprotikon anticlines) in Greece, shows the regional scale potential of petroleum plays. These prospects for new oil and gas discoveries constitute the object of this important paper, offering completely new ideas.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,0,19,,,2190-0558,2190-0566,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-06-01,WOS:000363898900002,,

An enhancement of this slow natural process could remove substantial amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere, aiming to offset some unavoidable anthropogenic emissions in order to comply with the Paris Agreement, while at the same time it may decrease ocean acidification. We provide the first comprehensive assessment of economic costs, energy requirements, technical parameterization, and global and regional carbon removal potential. The crucial parameters defining this potential are the grain size and weathering rates. The main uncertainties about the potential relate to weathering rates and rock mass that can be integrated into the soil. The discussed results do not specifically address the enhancement of weathering through microbial processes, feedback of geogenic nutrient release, and bioturbation. We do not only assess dunite rock, predominantly bearing olivine (in the form of forsterite) as the mineral that has been previously proposed to be best suited for carbon removal, but focus also on basaltic rock to minimize potential negative side effects. Our results show that enhanced weathering is an option for carbon dioxide removal that could be competitive already at 60 US $ t(-1) CO2 removed for dunite, but only at 200 US $ t(-1) CO2 removed for basalt. The potential carbon removal on cropland areas could be as large as 95 Gt CO2 a(-1) for dunite and 4.9 Gt CO2 a(-1) for basalt. The best suited locations are warm and humid areas, particularly in India, Brazil, South-East Asia and China, where almost 75% of the global potential can be realized.

The combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing can extract huge quantities of natural gas from impermeable shale formations, which were previously thought to be either impossible or uneconomic to produce. This review offers a comprehensive insight into US shale gas opportunities, appraising the evolution, evidence and the challenges of shale gas production in the US. The history of US shale gas in this article is divided into three periods and based on the change of oil price (i.e., the period before the 1970s oil crisis, the period from 1970s to 2000, and the period since 2000), the US has moved from being one of the world's biggest importers of gas to being self-sufficient in less than a decade, with the shale gas production increasing 12-fold (from 2000 to 2010). The US domestic natural gas price hit a 10-year low in 2012. The US domestic natural gas price in the first half of 2012 was about $2 per million British Thermal Unit (BTU), compared with Brent crude, the world benchmark price for oil, now about $ 80-100/barrel, or $14-17 per million BTU. Partly due to an increase in gas-fired power generation in response to low gas prices, US carbon emissions from fossil-fuel combustion fell by 430 million ton CO2 - more than any other country - between 2006 and 2011. Shale gas also stimulated economic growth, creating 600,000 new jobs in the US by 2010. However, the US shale gas revolution would be curbed, if the environmental risks posed by hydraulic fracturing are not managed effectively. The hydraulic fracturing is water intensive, and can cause pollution in the marine environment, with implications for long-term environmental sustainability in several ways. Also, large amounts of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, can be emitted during the shale gas exploration and production. Hydraulic fracturing also may induce earthquakes. These environmental risks need to be managed by good practices which is not being applied by all the producers in all the locations. Enforcing stronger regulations are necessary to minimize risk to the environment and on human health. Robust regulatory oversight can however increase the cost of extraction, but stringent regulations can foster an historic opportunity to provide cheaper and cleaner gas to meet the consumer demand, as well as to usher in the future growth of the industry.

Increasingly, these agricultural operations add significant amounts ofpollutants, from water run off into the watersheds, and infiltrate the groundwater. For example,the Shenandoah Valley has suffered from years of agricultural operations and livestockproduction causing increased nitrates and phosphorus in the groundwater. Typically, elevatedlevels of nitrates, nitrites, phosphorus, and arsenic among others, are found, causing watershedfish kills and impact to public health in myriad ways.Micronic Technologies has developed, MicroDesalTM, a patented low-pressure, low-temperature,rapid-evaporation technology, to treat contaminated water, including these dangerous contaminants. Preliminary MicroDesalTM testing indicates effective removal of heavy metals andother contaminants, including phosphorous, arsenic, nitrates, and bacteria. For example, thetechnology reduced phosphorous to less than 0.03 mg/L from 2.0 mg/L, nitrates to .40 mg/l from446.1, and nitrites to 0.4 mg/L from 27 mg/L.The proposed SBIR Phase I research objective is to validate reliability and reproducibility of theseinitial test results by reducing highly contaminated water pollutants to below EPA drinking waterstandards, through a robust testing regime. Phosphates, nitrites, nitrates, arsenic, heavy metals, and other agriculturally related pollutants from surface runoff water into the Chesapeake Bay, willbe tested over two seasons. Micronic will obtain samples from four strategic watershed locationsthat are representative of agriculturally related water runoff conditions selected in collaborationwith the Chesapeake Bay Program Office, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Potomac River Keepers,and Shenandoah River Keepers. This effort will provide the framework for Phase II which will include customization and fabrication of a field pilotsystem, as well as testing a wider suite of contaminants, including endocrine disruptors, bacteria,and other particular contaminants that are health hazards.This research will benefit the agricultural community by providing a low-cost, highly efficienttechnology to remove pollutants commonly associated with agricultural operations. It willsupport LPPFs and CAFOs in meeting increased regulatory requirements as well as theagricultural industry commitment to reduce impact on surface water pollution and protectgroundwater sources.MicroDesalTM is compact and expected to be scalable to larger capacity based on externalengineering assessments. Micronic has identified markets for 1,500; 5,000; 15,000; 20,000; and150,000 gallons per day of treatment capacity. Each capacity level is targeted for a specificcommercial customer application based on extensive discussions with a variety of public andprivate industry sectors and market research.

In this study, thin section, cathodoluminescence (CL), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectrum, carbon and oxygen isotopes, and fluid inclusion analyses are used to restructure paragenetic sequences and detect origins of carbonate cements recorded in this deeply buried member. Based on petrographic analyses, the Es-3 sandstones are identified as lithic arkoses and feldspathic litharenites at present, but derived from original arkoses and lithic arkoses, respectively. Geohistorically, the Es-3 sandstones have undergone two diagenetic episodes of eogenesis and mesogenesis. Events observed during eogenesis include chemical compaction, leaching of feldspar, development of chlorite coating and kaolinite, precipitation of the first generation of quartz overgrowth (QogI), dissolution of feldspar, and precipitation of calcite and nonferroan dolomite cement. Mesogenetic alterations include chemical compaction, precipitation of kaolinite aggregate and the second generation of quartz overgrowth (QogII), precipitation of ankerite, development of I/S and illite, and formation of pyrite. Carbon and oxygen isotopic data show that calcite cements are characterized by C-13 (delta 13CPDB ranging from -0.7 parts per thousand to 1.0 parts per thousand with an average of 0.1 parts per thousand) and O-18 (delta 18OSMOW varying from 12.3 parts per thousand to 19.0 parts per thousand with an average of 16.2 parts per thousand); these stable isotopic data combined with Z value (from 114.69 to 122.18) indicate skeletal debris (delta 13CPDB ranging from -1.2 parts per thousand to -1.1 parts per thousand with an average of -1.15 parts per thousand; delta 18OSMOW varying from 23.0 parts per thousand to 23.2 parts per thousand with an average of 23.1 parts per thousand) and ooids in adjacent carbonate beds involved in meteoric water and seawater from outside jointly served as the carbon sources. For nonferroan dolomite, the delta 13CPDB value of -4.1 parts per thousand is a little bit negative than the calcite, and the delta 18OSMOW of 14.3 parts per thousand is coincident with the calcite, which suggest the nonferroan dolomites come from the diagenetic fluids with a similar oxygen isotopic composition to that of the calcite but modified by the external acidic delta C-13-depleted water. However, the ankerites are actually rich in C-12 (delta 13CPDB ranging from -10.0 parts per thousand to -1.2 parts per thousand, mean=-4.3 parts per thousand) and O-16 (delta 18OSMOW varying from 10.1 parts per thousand to 19.4 parts per thousand, mean=14.9 parts per thousand), when combined with the distribution of cutting down along the direction pointing to sand-body center from the margin and microthermometric temperature (Th's) data mainly varying between 115.2 degrees C and 135.5 degrees C with an average of 96.0 degrees C, indicating the main origination from the Es-3 source rocks with effective feldspar buffer action for the acidic fluids in the margins of the Es-3 sandstones. In addition, the necessary elements for ankerite such as Fe2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ions also come from organic matter and clay minerals during thermal maturation of the Es-3 source rocks.The study provides insights into diagenetic processes and origination of carbonate cements in the Es-3 sandstones; it will facilitate the cognition of predictive models of deeply buried sandstone reservoirs to some extent, which can reduce the risks involved in oil and gas exploration and development.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1468-8115,1468-8123,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Geomech, Beijing 100081, Peoples R ChinaMinist Nat Resources, Key Lab Paleomagnetism & Tecton Reconstruct, Beijing 100081, Peoples R ChinaPetroChina Huabei Oilfield Co, Renqiu 062552, Hebei, Peoples R ChinaShaanxi Yanchang Petr Grp Corp Ltd, Xian 710075, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Chengkaidelin Sci & Technol Corp Ltd, Beijing 102200, Peoples R China",Beijing Chengkaidelin Sci & Technol Corp Ltd,,,2020-12-22,WOS:000595932900003,,

This heterogeneity, however, is hard to investigate by conventional geological and (organic) geochemical tools and thus is critical and challenging to study. Here, we attempted multivariate statistical analysis to reveal the heterogeneity based on a case study in the lacustrine tight oil accumulation in the middle Permian Lucaogou Formation of the Jimusar sag, Junggar Basin, NW China. Clustering heat maps and multi-dimensional scaling analysis revealed the heterogeneity of tight oil accumulation. The heterogeneity is reflected by the complex relationship between the two reservoir sweet spots as well as the oil migration and accumulation vertically and spatially, rather than the previous thoughts that it is a closed system associated with proximal hydrocarbon accumulation patterns. Multiple biomarkers show that the source rocks and reservoirs have similar characteristics in the lower part of the formation, reflecting a proximal hydrocarbon accumulation pattern in the lower sweet spot (near-source accumulation, abbreviated as NA). This represents a relatively closed system. However, the upper sweet spot and the middle section mudstone sequence intervening the two sweet spots are not a completely closed system in a strict sense. These sequences can be divided into three tight oil segments, i.e., lower, middle, and upper from deep to shallow. The lower segment is sited in the lower part of the middle section mudstone sequence. The middle segment is composed of the upper part of the middle section mudstone sequence and the lower part of the upper sweet spot. The upper segment is composed of the upper part of the upper sweet spot and the overlying upper Permian Wutonggou Formation reservoirs. Oils generated in the lower segment migrated vertically to upper sweet spot reservoirs through faults/fractures, and laterally to distal reservoirs. Oils generated in the middle segment were preserved in reservoirs of the upper sweet spot. Oils in the upper segment require accumulation by vertical and lateral migration through faults/fractures. As such, the tight oil accumulation is complex in the Lucaogou Formation. From base to top, the accumulation mechanisms in the Lucaogou Formation were NA, VLMA (vertical and lateral migration and accumulation), NA and VLMA, thereby showing strong heterogeneities. Our data suggest that these processes might be typical of tight oil accumulations universally, and are important for future exploration and exploitation in the region to consider the heterogeneities rather than a closed system.

The author suggests to insert several provisions to address the problems in the KCC.The SPC(Special Purpose Company) is established for the purpose of protecting the lender’s interest in ship financing. It has only a ship. When the SPC vessel becomes a wreck, the creditor which removed it tries to collect the expenses from the SPC as the registered owner who is the debtor. However, the SPC has no other property than the sunken vessel and thus the creditor has difficulty in materializing its claim against the shipowner. The claimant may try to pierce the corporate veil of the SPC as a result which the bareboat charterer is regarded as the debtor because it is the actual owner of the vessel. The author finds that the attempt of the creditor to pierce corporate veil of the SPC will not be successful because it has been established based on the relevant law. The author proposes to impose upon the SPC buying the compulsory liability insurance for the purpose of protecting the claimants.The unmanned vessel which is currently developed is a hybrid type of the AI (Artificial Intelligence) and the controller at shore. Because there is no crew on board at all in the unmanned vessel, lots of rules and regulation involved in crew will not be abided by. Nevertheless, most of the cases will be solved by changing the master on board with the controller at shore. The controller at shore will be regarded as a servant or agent of the carrier and thus the carrier will be liable for the cargo damages caused by the fault of the controller at shore. In the time charter party the shipowner should provide the controller at shore rather than the master when it lends the unmanned vessel to the time charterer. The piracy will be disappeared in the age of the unmanned vessel.Even though the unmanned vessel is technically feasible, the number of crews on board should be decided from the view point of socially acceptable level. In this regard, the minimum manning requirement under the SOLAS will play a great role in deciding the appropriate number of crew on board.The rationale for the commercial law to pursue is to protect the merchant, to protect the opposing party of the merchant and to facilitate commercial transaction by providing foreseeability. The author tries to achieve the above three rationale for the commercial law by providing analysis and proposal against three upcoming issues including the container, SPC and unmanned vessel.",,,,"본 논문에서 필자는 21세기 전반기동안 해상법에서 큰 충격을 가져올 3가지 사항-컨테이너, SPC(특수목적회사) 및 무인선박-에 대하여 다룬다.컨테이너는 약 20년 동안 이미 정기선 운항에 사용되어왔다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 한국해상법은 이것을 해상기업의 물적 수단으로 수용하지 않고 있다. 그 때문에 컨테이너관련 이해당사자들 사이에 법적 불안정이 존재한다. 특히 운송인이 담보로서 이를 활용하여 차금을 하거나 유치권을 행사하는 경우, 그리고 운송인이 이를 수하인으로부터 회수하는 경우에 문제가 있다. 필자는 컨테이너를 상법상 물적 수단으로 도입하는 안을 제안한다.특수목적회사는 선박금융시에 금융제공자의 이익을 보호하기 위하여 설립된다. 특수목적회사는 단지 한척의 선박만 소유한다. 그 선박이 난파물이 되는 경우 이를 제거한 채권자는 그 비용을 소유자로부터 회수하려고 한다. 그러나, 특수목적회사는 침몰한 선박 이외에는 재산이 없기 때문에 채권회수에 어려움이 있다. 채권자는 법인격부인론을 활용하여 선체용선자를 채무자로 하려고 하지만 특수목적회사는 법률에 근거하여 설립되었기 때문에 법인격부인론의 적용이 어려울 것으로 보인다. 필자는 등록선박소유자에게 강제책임보험에 가입하게 하는 등 채권자를 보호하기 위한 여러 수단을 제안한다.현재 개발되고 있는 무인선박은 인공지능과 육상의 관리자의 혼합형이다, 무인선박에는 전혀 사람이 승선하지 않기 때문에 선원과 관련된 규정이나 규칙은 지켜질 수 없을 것이다. 대부분의 사안은 선장을 육상의 관리자로 대체함으로써 해결될 수 있을 것이다. 육상의 관리자는 운송인의 대리인 혹은 사용인으로 간주될 수 있고 따라서 운송인은 육상의 관리자의 과실로 인하여 발생한 운송물손상에 대하여 책임을 부담하게 될 것이다. 정기용선계약 하에서 무인선박이 정기용선자에게 용선될 때 선박소유자는 선장이 아니라 육상의 관리자를 공급하여야 한다. 무인선박시대에는 해적은 사라질 것이다. 무인선박이 기술적으로 가능할 것이라도 승선중인 선박의 숫자는 사회적으로 가능한 관점에서 결정되어야 할 것이다. 이점에서 SOLAS협약의 최소승무정원요건(minimum manning requirement)은 적절한 승선선원의 숫자를 정함에 있어서 중요한 기능을 할 것으로 보인다.상법의 이념은 상인과 그 상대방을 보호하고 예측가능성을 제공하여 상거래를 원할히 하는 것에 있다. 필자는 컨테이너, SPC 그리고 무인선박의 쟁점도 이러한 상법의 이념을 달성하는 관점에서 분석하고 제안한다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1226-3362,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-09-30,KJD:ART002141018,,

In this context, the present study examines the effect of economic growth, urbanization, electricity consumption, fossil fuel energy consumption, and total natural resources rent on pollutant emissions in Africa over the period 1980-2014. By employing selected African countries, the current study relies on the Kao and Pedroni cointegration tests to cointegration analysis, the Pesaran's Panel Pooled Mean Group-Autoregressive distributive lag methodology (ARDL-PMG) for long run regression while Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) is employed for the detection of causality direction among the outlined variables. The study traces long run equilibrium relationships between examined indicators. The ARDL-PMG results suggest a statistical positive relationship between pollutant emissions and urbanization, electricity consumption and non-renewable energy consumption. Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) Granger causality test lends support to the long-run regression results. A bi-directional causality is observed between pollutant emissions, electricity consumption, economic growth and pollutant emissions while a unidirectional causality is apparent between total natural resources rent and pollutant emission. Based on these results, several policy implications for the African continent were suggested. (a) The need for a paradigm shift from fossil fuel sources to renewables is encouraged in the region (b) The need to embrace carbon storage and capturing techniques to decouple pollutant emissions from economic growth on the continent's growth trajectory. further policy insights are elucidated.

It remains, however, difficult to realistically simulate the economic circumstances and decisions, while including the economic uncertainties that surround the relevant markets and policies, and the geological and technological uncertainties that are inherent to dealing with reservoirs and novel technologies in a challenging environment. A new method is proposed here introducing a unique combination of innovations, that include true limited foresight, project flexibility, and the consideration of realistic investment risk. The value of project is here expressed as the Net Present Value (NPV). These elements are combined in the PSS IV simulator. This is a techno-economic simulator for CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR), which applies limited foresight and Real Options Analysis to make realistic investment decisions on projects with significant uncertainties and thus risk. Consecutive project decisions are taken based on a decision tree. Multiple oil fields can be approached as a single cluster project, which can provide a lower investment hurdle. In a first test case for PSS IV, the Claymore and Scott oil fields are assessed, and it is shown that economic simulations where FOR projects are regarded as a sum of the individual field assessments will undervalue projects. Simulation results show that results are in a realistic range compared to published numbers, with individual project values for the Claymore field on average of 15.8 sic/barrel (bbl; standard deviation SD = 8.3) and for the Scott field of 14.3 sic/bbl (SD = 8.6). Due to the inclusion of uncertainties and the application of limited foresight, results range from -6 sic/bbl (loss) to over 30 sic/bbl. In a cluster configuration 5 sic/bbl of additional value is created. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this regard, determination of the changes in the chemical composition of the spilled product is crucial for evaluation purposes. The GC-MS fingerprint approach requires the identification of several key parameters in order to differentiate between weathering processes. In this context, we performed a 900 -day study (eight sampling campaigns) of natural attenuation on a rocky shore affected by a heavy fuel oil spill. The residues coating the rocks were studied by extraction, separation and evaluation of SARA fractions, followed by GC-MS analysis for saturates and aromatics. The results identified a group of diagnostic ratios with irregular capabilities to differentiate between volatilization, photodegradation, and biodegradation (using n-alkanes, isoprenoids and PAHs), while a second group of primarily stable ratios (using dibenzothiphenes, tricyclics and hopanes) was also obtained. Notably, this is the first time that some of these ratios have been used for marine spill monitoring purposes. The ratios were applied not only to evaluate weathering at the study site, but also to obtain a comparison with the degradation of floating oil slicks a demonstration that weathering of the latter was quicker than that of oil on the shore rocks. Additionally, Pyrolysis-GC-MS analysis of the asphaltene fraction of residues coating the rocks revealed moderate changes in the composition of this initially recalcitrant fraction. These changes were consistent with those found in the proportion of resins and asphaltene fractions over time. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Possible products include fish oils, gelatin, biopolymers and minerals. These could be used in a range of industries from food, medicine and biotechnology to mining, chemical, oil and gas sectors. Chitin is a biopolymer that makes up to 30% of the waste in crustacean (shrimp, lobster and crab) shells. We have been looking at new uses for it beyond its application as a biomedical material. Our results in this area will be described. Fin-fish processing plants produce a varied waste stream but an oil-rich product can be isolated and used as a heating oil.

Under typical conditions, aqueous boron is present as boric acid (H3BO3), which is uncharged, making B particularly challenging to remove by mechanisms commonly applicable to removal of trace constituents. Adsorption of B onto aluminum hydroxide solids (Al(OH)(3)(s)) generated using aluminum-based electrocoagulation (EC) is a promising strategy for B removal. Infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated complexation of B(OH)(3) with aluminum hydroxide solids via surface hydroxyl groups, while X-ray and infrared spectroscopy results indicated that the structure of the Al(OH)(3)(s) was influenced both by EC operating conditions and by water quality. A linear adsorption model predicted B removal well when initial concentrations were lower than 50 mg/L, but fit the experimental data poorly at higher initial B concentrations. The Langmuir adsorption model provided a good fit for a broader range of initial B concentrations (5-1000 mg/L). Factors affecting B adsorption during the EC process, including current intensity, Al dissolution rate, boron concentration, pH, and total dissolved solid (TDS), were investigated. Increasing current intensity initially led to a higher Al dissolution rate, and therefore higher B adsorption, but there was a limit, as further increases in current intensity caused rapid formation of Al(OH)(3)(s) having a large particle size and a low capacity to complex B. Boron removal decreased as its concentration increased. The best removal of B occurred at pH 8, corresponding to a slightly positive zeta potential for aluminum hydroxide and a small but significant fraction of negatively charged B species. Higher TDS concentrations facilitated the use of higher current intensities, i.e., the limit on the effective Al dissolution rate increased with increasing TDS. Two real water samples (river water and oilfield produced water) spiked with B were treated using EC, resulting in up to 50% B removal from river water (C-0 = 10 mg/L, current = 0.2 A) in 2 h, and 80% B removal from produced water (C-0 = 50 mg/L, current = 1.0 A) in 2 h.

We examined major electron accepting processes in mature fine tailings (MFT). Beside methanogenesis and sulphate reduction, microbial iron reduction was an important process of anaerobic respiration. Microbial numbers and activity were comparable to those reported for natural lakes. To understand metabolic interactions of indigenous methanogenic and sulphate-reducing communities, we conducted a 6 month microcosm experiment with MFT supplemented with easily available carbon sources and molybdate and/or 2-bromoethane sulphonate (BES) as specific inhibitors for sulphate reduction and methanogenesis. Methanogenesis increased when microcosms were supplemented with extra carbon, but was completely inhibited by the addition of BES. Molybdate not only inhibited sulphate reduction, but also methanogenesis, indicating a positive relation between the two processes. The turnover of extra carbon sources differed between microcosms treated with molybdate and BES. Acetate and propionate were not consumed in microcosms amended with molybdate, indicating that sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were responsible for their metabolisation, and that methane was rather produced by hydrogenotrophic methanogens. In microcosms without molybdate, acetate transiently accumulated, indicating the activity of both incomplete and complete oxidizing SRB. Ethanol and lactate were also consumed in the simultaneous presence of BES and molybdate, demonstrating the occurrence of other anaerobic processes. Biomass increased by the addition of extra carbon, mainly due to a relative increase in the proportion of SRB. The addition of extra carbon lowered the degradation of BTEX compounds.

The demand for LNG is forecasted to reach 400 million tonnes by 2020, increasing up to 500 million tonnes in 2030. Due to its high mass and volumetric energy density, LNG is the perfect fuel for long-distance transport, as well as for use in mobile applications. It is also characterized by low levels of emissions, which is why it has been officially approved for use as a marine fuel in Emission Control Areas (ECAs) where stricter controls have been established to minimize the airborne emissions produced by ships. LNG is also an emerging fuel in heavy road and rail transport. As a cryogenic fuel that is characterized by a boiling temperature of about 120 K (-153 degrees C), LNG requires the special construction of cryogenic mobile installations to fulfill conflicting requirements, such as a robust mechanical construction and a low number of heat leaks to colder parts of the system under high safety standards. This paper provides a profound review of LNG applications in waterborne and land transport. Exemplary constructions of LNG engine supply systems are presented and discussed from the mechanical and thermodynamic points of view. Physical exergy recovery during LNG regasification is analyzed, and different methods of the process are both analytically and experimentally compared. The issues that surround two-phase flows and phase change processes in LNG regasification and recondensation are addressed, and technical solutions for boil-off gas recondensation are proposed.

A Pr/n-C-17 versus Pr/n-C-18 plot can be used to identify the end-numbers of mixed oils and the (C-13 + C-14)/(C-25 + C-26) ratio is a useful diagnostic ratio to detect the degree of weathering.

Following the analysis, it is identified that a pressurised and cooled H-2 storage system is the best suited to an LNG vessel due to its simplicity and the fact that it does not pose a safety hazard. There are a number of methods for consuming the H-2 generated in the DF engines that comprise the propulsion plant, but the use of a mixture of 70% CH 4-30% H-2 is the most suitable as it does not require any modifications to the injection system. Installation of an on-board reforming plant and H-2 storage system generates sufficient H-2 to allow for almost 3 days' autonomy with a mixture of 70%CH 4-30%H-2. This reduces the engine consumption of CH4 by 11.38%, thus demonstrating that the system is not only energy-efficient, but lends greater versatility to the vessel.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,0,17,,,1233-2585,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ A Coruna, Energy Engn Res Grp, Sch Naut Sci & Marine Engn, C Paseo Ronda 51, La Coruna 15011, SpainUniv La Rioja, Dept Mech Engn, C Luis de Ulloa 20, Logrono 26004, Spain",,,,2020-06-23,WOS:000539634500009,,

In Australian agricultural systems, this has the potential to deliver multiple benefits: increased whole-farm profitability and improved natural resource management. The profitability of shrubs was investigated using Model of an Integrated Dryland Agricultural System (MIDAS), a bio-economic model of a mixed crop/livestock farming system. The modelling indicated that including forage shrubs had the potential to increase farm profitability by an average of 24% for an optimal 10% of farm area used for shrubs under standard assumptions. The impact of shrubs on whole-farm profit accrues primarily through the provision of a predictable supply of 'out-of-season' feed, thereby reducing supplementary feed costs, and through deferment of use of other feed sources on the farm, allowing a higher stocking rate and improved animal production. The benefits for natural resource management and the environment include improved water use through summer-active, deep-rooted plants, and carbon storage. Forage shrubs also allow for the productive use of marginal soils. Finally, we discuss other, less obvious, benefits of shrubs such as potential benefits on livestock health. The principles revealed by the MIDAS modelling have wide application beyond the region, although these need to be adapted on farm and widely disseminated before potential contribution to Australian agriculture can be realized.

At all sampling times and sites, average P. marinus infection intensity (g wet wt tissue(-1) or ml hemolymph(-1)) was lowest in hemolymph samples, and generally highest in the digestive gland. Perkinsus marinus prevalence was 100% at both FL and NY sites for each of the 5 collection times, and, for the VA site, was less than 100% in only 1 month (May 1994). Seasonal intensity patterns and mean total body burdens differed among the sites. Average body burden was highest in VA during October and progressively declined to a minimum in May. This decline was probably due to mortality of heavily infected oysters and diminution of parasite activity associated with colder temperatures and reduced salinities. Intensities varied little during the months of October and December at both the FL and NY sites. Minimum average intensities were observed in March in FL oysters and May in NY oysters. Relatively high P. marinus infection levels that persisted throughout the winter in NY oysters compared with VA oysters could reflect constant high salinity in Long Island Sound which favors parasite activity, and also rapid decline in temperature in the fall that may have prevented epizootic oyster mortalities.",,,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,29,1,48,,,0177-5103,1616-1580,,,,,,,,,,"US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Gulf Ecol Div, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561 USAInst Marine & Coastal Sci, Haskin Shellfish Res Lab, Port Norris, NJ 08349 USAVirginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA",Inst Marine & Coastal Sci,,,1998-09-11,WOS:000077039000010,9789979,

As a result Kuwait's sparse fresh groundwater resources were severely contaminated with crude oil. Since then limited research has focused on the microbial community ecology of the groundwater and their impact on the associated contamination. Here, the microbial community ecology (bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic) and how it relates to the characteristics of the hydrocarbon contaminants were examined for the first time since the 1991 event. This study was conducted using 15 wells along the main groundwater flow direction and detected several potential hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms such as Hyphomicrobiaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and Eurotiomycetes. The beta diversity of the microbial communities correlated significantly with total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentrations and salinity. The TPH consisted mainly of polar compounds present as an unresolved complex mixture (UCM) of a highly recalcitrant nature. Based on the proportions of TPH to dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the results indicate that some minor biodegradation has occurred within highly contaminated aquifer zones. However, overall the results from this study suggest that the observed variations in TPH concentrations among the sampled wells are mainly induced by mixing/dilution with pristine groundwater rather than by biodegradation of the contaminants. The findings make an important contribution to better understand the fate of the groundwater pollution in Kuwait, with important implications for the design of future remediation efforts.

Crack path and microstructure,,,,,,,,METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE,,,,32,9,,,2315,2324,,,,,,,,,,,Article,SEP 2001,2001,"In Part I of this article, the influence of various testing parameters and environments on the fatigue-crack growth rates in samples of beta-annealed Ti-6Al-4V-0.1Ru (extra-low interstitials) ELI was reported.([1]) A design-of-experiments (DOE) approach was used to survey different combinations of variables, all expected to be important for dynamically loaded offshore oil and gas production risers, and to identify significant effects on the fatigue-crack propagation rate at a stress-intensity range of DeltaK = 17 MPa rootm. The da/dN vs DeltaK curves also were examined for the DOE and supplementary tests, and the results of the two approaches were compared. In this part of the study, the microstructural basis for the robust fatigue-crack growth resistance of beta-annealed Ti-6Al-4V-0.1Ru (ELI) samples was investigated with optical metallography and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A gradual transition from structure-sensitive (microfacet formation) to structure-insensitive (striation formation) crack propagation centered at DeltaK(trans) congruent to 24 MPa rootm, regardless of the combination of testing/environmental conditions examined; the absence of a sharp transition in the slope of the da/dN vs AK curves was, therefore, entirely consistent with the fracture-surface morphology. The size of the reversed cyclic plastic zone at the transition AK value correlated with the size of the lamella packets, but the number of cycles required to generate a striation ranged between one and ten, suggesting that the crack actively grew over only a portion of its front at any one instant. It is interesting to note that DeltaK(trans) was the same as the stress range where the da/dN curves at 0.2, 2, and 20 Hz (in seawater) converged to a single curve (refer to Part I of this article): at lower stress ranges, crack growth rates at 20 Hz were significantly higher than those at 0.2 and 2 Hz. The quantitative data showed that fatigue cracks propagated parallel to lamellae interfaces when the long axes of the lamellae made a relatively small angle (< 30 deg) to the nominal crack-propagation direction. The crack cut directly across lamellae (i.e., perpendicular to their surfaces) when the long axes of the lamellae were nearly perpendicular to the nominal crack-propagation direction. If the lamellae long axes lay 45 deg to the crack-propagation direction, the crack deflected to run parallel or perpendicular to the lamellae. This behavior occurred regardless of the environment and loading conditions investigated. There was considerable variation in the amount that the cracks deviated from their nominal plane (i.e., the plane normal to the load axis and through the notch tip), with much greater deflections in the cold-rolled than in the parent material, but the angle of the macroscopic crack plane did not exceed I I deg. Crack branching was observed both at the center and outer surfaces of the samples, regardless of AK or other parameters. The relationship between micro- and macrobranches was examined, and branching was more prominent below DeltaK(trans) which separated the structure-sensitive and continuum-mode-crack-propagation regimes. The relative amounts of micro- and microbranches are reported, and this branching may explain the large scatter in the measurements of the fatigue-crack growth rate often encountered in Ti-6Al-4V and its variants and points to the need for thorough characterization of crack paths, both midplane and surface, as part of the interpretation of da/dN vs AK data.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,,,1073-5623,,,,,,,,,,,"Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USAGeorgia Inst Technol, Mech Properties Res Lab, Atlanta, GA 30332 USAScana Stavanger AS, Strateg Business Unit Casting Proc Foundry, Stavanger, Norway",Scana Stavanger AS,,,2001-09-01,WOS:000170925100015,,

As the use of oil dispersants has become one of the main practices in remediation of oil spill, the effect of oil dispersants on the treatment effectiveness remains unexplored. Specifically, little is known on the removal of dispersed oil from contaminated water using conventional adsorbents. This study investigated sorption behavior of three prototype activated charcoals (ACs) of different particle sizes (4-12, 12-20 and 100 mesh) for removal of dispersed oil hydrocarbons, and effects of two model oil dispersants (Corexit EC9500A and Corexit EC9527A). The oil content was measured as n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs). Characterization results showed that the smallest AC (PAC100) offered the highest BET surface area of 889 m(2) /g and pore volume of 0.95 cm(3) /g (PHezc = 6.1). Sorption kinetic data revealed that all three ACs can efficiently adsorb Corexit EC9500A and oil dispersed by the two dispersants (DWAO-I and DWAO-II), and the adsorption capacity followed the trend: PAC100 > GAC12 x 20> GAC4 x 12. Sorption isotherms confirmed PAC100 showed the highest adsorption capacity for dispersed oil in DWAO-I with a Freundlich K-F value of 10.90 mg/g center dot (Limmtin (n = 1.38). Furthermore, the presence of Corexit EC9500A showed two contrasting effects on the oil sorption, i.e., adsolubilization and solubilization depending on the dispersant concentration. Increasing solution pH from 6.0 to 9.0 and salinity from 2 to 8 wt% showed only modest effect on the sorption. The results are useful for effective treatment of dispersed oil in contaminated water and for understanding roles of oil dispersants. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Calculations were based on a standard static vegetation model (BIOME 1.1) driven by the most recent climate change scenarios from three coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (GCMs). The results indicated that boreal terrestrial carbon stocks increased greatly following the retreat of continental ice sheets, before which boreal forests covered only about a third the amount of land they cover now. Carbon stocks and wood supplies in boreal forests were also projected to increase if vegetation stabilized under all three future climate scenarios (6-15%). However, the opposite response occurred with the addition of expected constraints on forest growth, provided by the lags in immigration of tree species suitable for warmed climate. This transient depauperate condition reduced wood supplies considerably (4-6%). Inclusion of present and future agricultural land uses permitted by a warming climate forced carbon stocks and wood supplies to decline even more (10-20%).

Uncertainty is first estimated by allowing modelled equilibrium climate sensitivity, aerosol forcing and intrinsic physical and biogeochemical processes to vary within widely accepted ranges. Results are then constrained by comparison against contemporary measurements. For both constrained and unconstrained projections, our calculated allowable emissions are close to the standard (harmonised) emission scenarios associated with these pathways. For RCP4.5, which is the most moderate scenario considered in terms of required emission abatement, then after year 2100 very low net emissions are needed to maintain prescribed year 2100 CO2 concentrations. As expected, RCP2.6 and SCP4.5 to 2.6 require more strict emission reductions. The implication of this is that direct sequestration of carbon dioxide is likely to be required for RCP4.5 or higher mitigation scenarios, to offset any minimum emissions for society to function (the 'emissions floor'). Despite large uncertainties in the physical and biogeochemical processes, constraints from model-observational comparisons support a high degree of confidence in predicting the allowable emissions consistent with a particular concentration pathway. In contrast the uncertainty in the resulting temperature range remains large. For many parameter sets, and especially for RCP2.6, the land will turn into a carbon source within the 21st century, but the ocean will remain as a carbon sink. For land carbon storage and our modelling framework, major reductions are seen in northern high latitudes and the Amazon basin even after atmospheric CO2 is stabilised, while for ocean carbon uptake, the tropical ocean regions will be a source to the atmosphere, although uncertainties on this are large. The parameters which most significantly affect the allowable emissions are aerosols and climate sensitivity, but some carbon-cycle related parameters (e.g. maximum photosynthetic rate and respiration's temperature dependency of vegetation) also have significant effects. Parameter values are constrained by observation, and we found that the CO2 emission data had a significant effect in constraining climate sensitivity and the magnitude of aerosol radiative forcing.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,0,8,,,1600-0889,,,,,,,,,,,"Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, JapanCtr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England",,,,2013-12-25,WOS:000327743800001,,

Here we present high pressure (P)-temperature (T) experiments that offer new constraints upon the partitioning of carbon between metallic and silicate melt in a shallow magma ocean. Experiments were performed at 1-5 GPa, 1600-2100 degrees C on mixtures of synthetic or natural silicates (tholeiitic basalt/alkali basalt/komatiite/fertile peridotite) and Fe-Ni-C +/- Co +/- S contained in graphite or MgO capsules. All the experiments produced immiscible Fe-rich metallic and silicate melts at oxygen fugacity (fO(2)) between similar to IW-1.5 and IW-1.9. Carbon and hydrogen concentrations of basaltic glasses and non-glassy quenched silicate melts were determined using secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS) and speciation of dissolved C-O-H volatiles in silicate glasses was studied using Raman spectroscopy. Carbon contents of metallic melts were determined using both electron microprobe and SIMS. Our experiments indicate that at core-forming, reduced conditions, carbon in deep mafic-ultramafic magmas may dissolve primarily as various hydrogenated species but the total carbon storage capacity, although is significantly higher than solubility of CO2 under similar conditions, remains low (<500 ppm). The total carbon content in our reduced melts at graphite saturation increases with increasing melt depolymerization (NBO/T), consistent with recent spectroscopic studies, and modestly with increasing hydration. Carbon behaves as a metal-loving element during core-mantle separation and our experimental D-C(metal/silicate) varies between similar to 4750 and >= 150 and increases with increasing pressure and decreases with increasing temperature and melt NBO/T.Our data suggest that if only a trace amount of carbon (similar to 730 ppm C) was available during early Earth differentiation, most of it was partitioned to the core (with 0.20-0.25 wt.% C) and no more than similar to 10-30% of the present-day mantle carbon budget (50-200 ppm CO2) could be derived from a magma ocean residual to core formation. With equilibrium core formation removing most of the carbon initially retained in the terrestrial magma ocean, explanation of the modern bulk silicate Earth carbon inventory requires a later replenishment mechanism. Partial entrapment of metal melt in solid silicate matrix, carbon ingassing by magma ocean-atmosphere interaction, and carbon outgassing from the core aided by reaction of core metal and deeply subducted water are some of the viable mechanisms.

J,,,,,,,,,"SHERRIFF, RO, .",,TREE GROWTH AND CARBON ACCUMULATION IN THE FACE OF DROUGHT: DOES FOREST MANAGEMENT CONFER RESISTANCE AND RESILIENCE?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Aug 01 2014,2014,"A century of fire exclusion across many forest types in the western U.S. has resulted in unforeseen changes, including high fuel accumulations, high densities of trees and increasing dominance of fire-intolerant species. In response, federal and state agencies promote large-scale forest management programs to reduce understory fuels and forest density. Treated stands are expected to be more resistant (showing measurably less response) to future disturbances, such as wildfire. While thinning and prescribed fire will likely help achieve second-growth restoration goals in terms of forest structure (size, arrangement, and tree species composition), the consequences for forest resiliency to drought stress and carbon are unclear. Forest thinning, by definition, will remove carbon from the system. However, the enhanced growth of remaining trees may offset these losses. The severe drought extending from 2012 to 2014 across much of California provides a remarkable natural experiment to test if thinning and prescribed fire treatments create conditions where forests are resistant to drought.We propose to measure how forest growth varies across a steep climatic gradient, from the Pacific Ocean to continental climates within five National Parks in the Klamath Mountain region, paying special attention to the effects of episodes of severe drought (1923-1924, 1976-1977 and 2012-2014). Moreover, we will determine how forest management interacts with these patterns, assessing variance in growth by treatment type (prescribed fire and thinning) and treatment intensity (e.g., the number, size class, and basal area of trees removed). Key forest management questions that our study will address include: 1) has prescribed fire and forest thinning removed enough small trees so that remaining trees have sufficient moisture to survive the current extended drought? And 2) how do forest management treatments influence tree growth response, also a measure of forest carbon, across the steep climatic gradient found in the Klamath region? This research agenda will provide regional land managers with information to assess if current strategies of prescribed fire and forest thinning practices sufficiently increase the resilience of remaining trees to maintain growth during and after extended drought periods, ultimately influencing stand carbon storage. The results of this study will be disseminated in a variety of ways to advance scientific knowledge and provide information on thresholds and types of forest management practices that can promote stand resistance and resilience to drought.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1003252; 690577,,,,,,,,HUMBOLDT STATE UNIVERSITY,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:12732120,,

Two separate geometries (two different models) are drawn for a ship's hull: with and without an air lubrication system. Our aim is to extract two different skin friction coefficients, which affect the fuel consumption and the CO2 emissions of the ship. A ship's hull has never been designed before in real scale with air lubrication injectors adjusted in a computational environment, in order to simulate the function of air lubrication system. The system's impact on the minimization of LNG transfer cost and on the reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions is also examined.

Some variability within and between samples was observed, arising from differences in exposure to light and water, which increase the amount of weathering. Oxygenated hydrocarbons (OxHC) produced by weathering processes dominate the majority of oil residues. These OxHC have continued recalcitrance in the environment, and increase in relative abundance over time.

Aboveground biomass was estimated from allometric equations relating stem and branch diameters of individual trees to their biomass. Biomass production was calculated from annual increments in tree diameters and measurements of litterfall. Maintenance and construction respiration were calculated for each component using equations given by Ryan (1991a). Total belowground C flux was estimated from measurements of annual soil CO2 efflux less the C content of annual litterfall (assuming forest floor and soil C were at approximate steady state for the year that soil CO2 efflux was measured). The total C content of the standing biomass of the unfertilized stand was 138 t ha(-1), with approximately 80% aboveground and 20% belowground. Forest floor C was 8.5 t ha(-1). Soil C content (0-1 m) was 369 t ha(-1) representing 70% of the total C pool in the ecosystem. Total gross annual C flux aboveground (biomass increment plus litterfall plus respiration) was 11.9 t ha(-1) and gross flux belowground (coarse root increment plus fine root production plus root respiration) was 5.1 t ha(-1). Total annual soil efflux was 7.1 t ha(-1), of which 2.5 t ha(-1) (35%) was contributed by litter decomposition.The short-term effect of changing the availability of P compared with C on allocation to aboveground versus belowground processes was estimated by comparing fertilized and unfertilized stands during the year after treatment. In the P-fertilized stand annual wood biomass increment increased by 30%, there was no evidence of change in canopy biomass, and belowground C allocation decreased by 19% relative to the unfertilized stand. Total annual C flux was 16.97 and 16.75 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and the ratio of below-to aboveground C allocation was 0.43 and 0.35 in the unfertilized and P-fertilized stands, respectively. Therefore, the major response of the forest stand to increased soil P availability appeared to be a shift in C allocation; with little change in total productivity. These results emphasise that both growth rate and allocation need to be estimated to predict changes in fluxes and storage of C in forests that may occur in response to disturbance or climate change.",,,,,,,,,66,2,0,0,40,1,69,,,0032-079X,,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV NEW S WALES,DEPT BIOL SCI,KENSINGTON,NSW 2052,AUSTRALIA",,,,1997-09-01,WOS:A1997YL66500009,,

As a result, warnings of impending climate disasters are growing every day in urgency. Beyond ordinary CO2 removal through natural CO2 sinks such as oceans and forest vegetation, direct CO2 conversion into valuable intermediaries is necessary. Here, a direct electrosynthesis of the peroxydicarbonate anion (C2062-) was investigated by the reaction of CO2 with the superoxide ion (021, electrochemically generated from 02 reduction in bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion derived ionic liquid (IL) media. This is the first time that the IL media were employed successfully for CO2 conversion into C2062-. Moreover, the charge transfer coefficient for the 02-generation process in the ILs was less than 0.5, indicating that the process was irreversible. Voltammetry experiments coupled with global electrophilicity index analysis revealed that, when CO2/02 was contacted simultaneously in the IL medium, 02. was generated in situ first at a potential of approximately -1.0 V. Also, CO2 was more susceptible to attack by 02-before any possible interaction with the IL except for [PMIm+][TFSI-]. This was because CO2 has a higher global electrophilicity index (.wco, = 0.489 eV) than those for the [EDMPAmml [TFSI-] and [MOEMMorl [TFSI-]. By further COSMO-RS modeling, CO2 absorption was proven feasible at the COSMO-surface of the [ITSI-] IL-anion where the charge densities were a =-1.100 and 1.1097 e/nm2. Therefore, the susceptible competitiveness of either IL cations or CO2 to the nucleophilic effects of 02-was a function of their positive character as estimated by their electrophilicity indices. As determined by experimental attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and DFT-FTIR computation, the reaction yielded C2062-in the ILs. Consequently, the presence of 0=0 symmetric stretching FTIR vibrational mode at '844 cm-1 coupled with the disappearance of the oxidative cyclic voltammetry waves when sparging CO2 and 02 confirmed the presence of C2062-. Moreover, based on DFT/B3LYP/6-31G, pure C2062-has symmetric 0=0 stretching at-805 and 844 cm-1 when it is in association with the IL cation. This was the first spectroscopic observation of C2062-in ILs, and the 0=0 symmetric stretching vibration has peculiarity for identifying C2062-in ILs. This will open new doors to utilize CO2 in industrial applications with the aid of reactive oxygen species.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,12,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, MalaysiaUniv Malaya, UMCiL, Kuala Lumpur 50603, MalaysiaSohar Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Fac Engn, POB 44, Sohar 311, OmanSunway Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Ctr Carbon Dioxide Capture & Utilisat CCDCU, Bandar Sunway 47500, Petaling Jaya, MalaysiaUniv Lancaster, Dept Engn, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",,,,2019-08-08,WOS:000477787200031,31305059,

The polymer-surfactant flooding, as one of the main subsets of chemical flooding methods, is a vigorous Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) method which can be applied with a high level of performance in sandstone reservoirs. Applying the aforementioned technique is very often unfeasible due to the expensive chemical additives and surfactant loss in term of adsorption on the reservoir rock. This paper mainly deals with the adsorption behavior (both static and dynamic) of the natural surfactant, which extracted surfactant from leaves of Zyziphus Spina Christi, onto a real shale-sandstone reservoir samples. Furthermore, adsorption kinetics and equilibrium are determined to help the understanding of the adsorption mechanism. To examine the effect of adsorbent dose on the adsorption efficiency, static adsorption experiments are performed. The effect of temperature on the kinetic and equilibrium of adsorption process was experimentally done. Finally, two core flooding experiments are carried out to determine the adsorption behavior in dynamic conditions. It was emerged that the Freundlich model has a more permissible fit for the adsorption equilibrium of natural surfactant after analyzing the related data for four models. Moreover, the laboratorial research about the adsorption kinetics proved statistically that pseudo-second order model prepares the best kinetics model for the natural surfactant.

Like a tangled skein, Voyage is packed with diverse episodes and unfamiliar characters without a coherent plot. So a reader or an audience member will find it difficult to follow the play and properly appreciate it. Hence the need to clarify the construction. As for the description of Bakunin, it requires a detailed study in that the question should not be simply ignored on the excuse of Voyage being a fiction. As a dramatic work, Voyage is no doubt a fictional work, but it is also true that it is constructed in such a way that the characters and events described in it are the real historical people and events.Voyage is made up of two acts; the first focuses on Bakunin’s private life in Premukhino, while the second is more concerned with Bakunin’s public life in Moscow. The first act is largely about the episodes of Bakunin’s sisters’ romance and marriages, which is depicted in a distinctively Chekhovian style.The second act is in a way more confusing in that, though Bakunin still plays the major role, it does not proceed with a firm focus on Bakunin. While preparing for the subsequent Shipwreck and Salvage with the introduction of Herzen, the protagonist in both plays, it seems to be intended to give a wide politico-cultural view of the age.Stoppard openly acknowledged that in writing his trilogy he owed a lot to such eminent scholars as Edward Carr, Isaiah Berlin and Aileen Kelly.Unfortunately, however, they happen to be antagonistic to Bakunin and his ideas in various degrees. And in Voyage, quite expectedly, Bakunin is depicted in a very negative way. The negative treatment of Bakunin, however, cannot be wholly ascribed to the influences of the above-mentioned scholars, because a number of recent works on Bakunin including a biography give a more balanced appreciation of Bakunin and his ideas. The treatment of Bakunin in Voyage, therefore, definitely reflects Stoppard’s own ideological orientation and prejudices. In the end, it depends on oneself whether he/she feels sympathy with Bakunin and what he stands for, but it must be borne in mind that Bakunin was basically a freedom fighter, and a true criticism of his life and ideas should be made at least on the basis of that recognition.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1226-3397,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-10-29,KJD:ART002022969,,

To achieve rational, efficient and clean use of energy, together with improved environmental quality within the city, the Shanghai municipal government has decided to expand the supply and utilization of natural gas. Shanghai plans to increase the share of natural gas in its primary energy mix to 7 per cent by 2010, up from 3 per cent in 2005. This increase in natural gas demand has to be matched with a corresponding increase in supply. To date, the Shanghai region has relied on offshore extracted natural gas but this supply is limited due to the size of the reserves. Since 2005, the West-East pipeline has provided an alternative for Shanghai but demands from other regions could reduce the potential for expanding supplies from that source. Since domestic production will not be sufficient to meet demand in the near future, Shanghai is building a liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification terminal at the Yangshan deep-water port that would allow an additional supply of more than 3 billion cubic meters per year of natural gas. Malaysia has already committed to supply LNG to the Shanghai terminal at a price that is significantly higher than the wholesale city-gate price for natural gas transported via pipeline, but still lower than the gas price to end-use consumers. The presence of both an LNG terminal and a transmission pipeline that connects Shanghai to domestic gas-producing regions will create gas-on-gas competition. This study assesses the benefits of introducing such competition to one of China's most advanced cities under various scenarios for demand growth. In this paper, the impact of imported LNG on market concentration in Shanghai's gas market will be analysed using the Herfindahl-Hirschmann index (HHI) and the residual supply index (RSI). Our results show that Shanghai remains a supply-constrained gas market that will continue to rely upon gas supplies from the western provinces and imported LNG. After 2017, the gas market in Shanghai can be regarded as unconcentrated since its HHI fall below 1800 under a very high growth scenario. In terms of RSI, the gas market can be considered competitive at low, moderate and high growth consumption between 2012 and 2015. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the literature, various methods have been utilized for the evaluation of renewable energy sources. In particular, multi-attribute decision making (MADM) methods have been widely used throughout the renewable energy literature for several purposes such as evaluation of energy policies, selection of the most suitable renewable energy source for electricity generation, evaluation of renewable energy sources, identification of the optimal site for a renewable energy facility, and selection of the best one among energy alternatives. In the scope of this paper, the studies employing MADM methods in renewable energy applications have been taken into consideration. The main aim of the study is to determine the reasons and factors explaining why these methods have been employed. It can be concluded that Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Analytic Network Process (ANP), ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalite (ELECTRE) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) have come into the forefront as the most widely employed methods in the literature. However, there are a few studies employing outranking methods, ELECTRE and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) for the purpose of evaluating renewable energy investments/projects. Furthermore, in the literature, there are limited papers considering utilization of renewable energy sources such as geothermal, hydro, and waste.

However, natural gas is comparatively difficult to be ignited and its flame penetrates slowly in a large bore combustion chamber especially for the lean condition. In order to analyze how the pre-chamber turbulent jet ignition promotes combustion in a large volume chamber, a comparative study with the traditional open chamber ignition mode was conducted to analyze the effect of excess air ratios and pre-mixed pressures on the combustion characteristics of methane/air mixtures. In rich fuel combustion, the advantage of pre-chamber is not obvious, and the flame propagation rate can only be increased by 2.8 times in maximum. In the case of lean combustion and stoichiometric combustion, the flame propagation speeds can be increased by 5-6 times, especially in lean combustion by pre-chamber. In general, the pre-chamber turbulent jet ignition technique can increase the flame propagation rate of methane/air, and improve combustion and thermal efficiency of natural gas large-bore engines under lean combustion conditions. With comparison to the open chamber ignition mode, the reduction percentage of ignition time by pre-chamber turbulent jet ignition decreases with the rise of initial pressure.

This places the process under substantial scrutiny in terms of its climate change impacts and thus, provides a strong case study for viable transition towards greater sustainable operations. Here we examine, for the first time, sustainable eco-park designs for the diversification of the ammonia industry utilizing industrial symbiosis. The network considers several carbon capture and utilization (CCU) applications as well as ammonia (NH3) integration to produce the following downstream products: NH3, urea, Urea Ammonium Nitrate (UAN), Melamine (Mel) and Methanol (MeOH). Our results demonstrate improved energy efficiency with the inclusion of MeOH while UAN decreases net energy demand. Economically, the incorporation of MeOH gave attractive returns on investment due to increased productivity. Insights into environmental sustainability, through the assessment of Planetary Boundaries (PBs), revealed high risk operations aligned to climate change and ocean acidification earth systems linked to BAU operations. These impacts improved considerably with the addition of MeOH, resulting in safe operations of the ammonia process, attributed to increased waste recovery. These results were further supported using Life Cycle Sustainability Assessments, highlighting the potential of the BAU + urea + UAN + Mel + MeOH eco-park design for enhanced sustainable development.

PtM arises for scenarios with 95% CO2 reduction, no CO2 underground storage and low CAPEX (75 (sic)/kW only for methanation). Capacity deployed across EU is 40 GW (8% of gas demand) for these conditions, which increases to 122 GW when liquefied methane gas (LMG) is used for marine transport. The simultaneous occurrence of all positive drivers for PtM, which include limited biomass potential, low Power-to-Liquid performance, use of PtM waste heat, among others, can increase this capacity to 546 GW (75% of gas demand). Gas demand is reduced to between 3.8 and 14 EJ (compared to similar to 20 EJ for 2015) with lower values corresponding to scenarios that are more restricted.

GC-FID results revealed a substantial hydrocarbon degradation rate in almost all hydrocarbon sources and in particular at 15 degrees C rather than 4 degrees C (for commercial oil engine, oily waste, fuel jet, and crude oil). A more efficient degradation was observed in cultures grown with diesel and bilge water at 4 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to tidal and waves actions, the oil spillage affects the shorelines by adhering to the soil, making it difficult for immediate cleaning of the soil. As shoreline clean-up is the most costly component of a response operation, there is a need for effective oil remediation technologies. This paper provides a review on the remediation technologies for soil contaminated with various types of oil, including diesel, crude oil, petroleum, lubricating oil, bitumen and bunker oil. The methods discussed include solvent extraction, bioremediation, phytoremediation, chemical oxidation, electrokinetic re mediation, thermal technologies, ultrasonication, flotation and integrated remediation technologies. Each of these technologies was discussed, and associated with their advantages, disadvantages, advancements and future work in detail. Nonetheless, it is important to note that no single remediation technology is considered the best solution for the remediation of oil contaminated soil.Capsule: This review provides a comprehensive literature on the various remediation technologies studied in the removal of different oil types from soil.

We applied a cultivation-independent genomic approach to define microbial community membership and predict roles for specific organisms in biogeochemical transformations in Alaska North Slope oil fields. Produced water samples were collected from six locations between 1,128m(24 to 27 degrees C) and 2,743m(80 to 83 degrees C) below the surface. Microbial community complexity decreased with increasing temperature, and the potential to degrade hydrocarbon compounds was most prevalent in the lower-temperature reservoirs. Sulfate availability, rather than sulfate reduction potential, seems to be the limiting factor for sulfide production in some of the reservoirs under investigation. Most microorganisms in the intermediate-and higher-temperature samples were related to previously studied methanogenic and nonmethanogenic archaea and thermophilic bacteria, but one candidate phylum bacterium, a member of the Acetothermia (OP1), was present in Kuparuk sample K3. The greatest numbers of candidate phyla were recovered from the mesothermic reservoir samples SB1 and SB2. We reconstructed a nearly complete genome for an organism from the candidate phylum Parcubacteria (OD1) that was abundant in sample SB1. Consistent with prior findings for members of this lineage, the OD1 genome is small, and metabolic predictions support an obligately anaerobic, fermentation-based lifestyle. At moderate abundance in samples SB1 and SB2 were members of bacteria from other candidate phyla, including Microgenomates (OP11), Atribacteria (OP9), candidate phyla TA06 and WS6, and Marinimicrobia (SAR406). The results presented here elucidate potential roles of organisms in oil reservoir biological processes.

This approach utilizes standard electrical wet-mate connectors on either end. Marinized media converters are contained within the back shells of each electrical connector which convert the Ethernet signal from electrical to optical. The optical signal can then be transmitted over distances far exceeding standard subsea electrical Ethernet capabilities.

J,,,,,,,,,Sandra Arndt,,Dynamics of the Earth System In REcovery ('DESIRE'),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Aug 31 2011,2011,"As we are doing now, at times in the distant geological past, there were massive releases of greenhouse gases such as CO2 to the atmosphere. In the rock record we find evidence for a warming of climate and change in rainfall patterns. How does the Earth recover from being put into this 'greenhouse' state? The obvious way of cooling climate is to remove the CO2 that has been added and to bury it in a form that will not quickly leak back to the atmosphere. By some complicated geochemical and biological trickery, the Earth can turn rocks such as granite into chalks and limestones, which contains carbon atoms bound tightly to calcium, locking up carbon for millions and millions of years (the carbon in the white cliffs of Dover has been safely stored there for over 65 millions years!). Another way to bury carbon is as organic matter and the Earth system has a really fascinating mechanism for preserving this carbon involving the gas given off by rotten eggs - hydrogen sulphide. This can react with organic matter to form new molecules that are more resistant to being broken down by bacteria. The process is a bit like making car tires (which appear highly resistant to decay judging by how many seem to lie strewn across our cities and countryside). So what conditions in the ocean lead to the most preservation and hence burial of organic matter, and what impact on atmospheric CO2 and climate does preserving organic matter with rotten eggs really have? Computer models are great tools and can help answer this. How we understand and represent the Earth's climate system in computer models, while still far from perfect, is progressively improving. Mostly the climate system involves physics, and despite what most students may conclude from school: physics is easy. More difficult to understand is chemistry and biology, particularly when it occurs in smelly (sulphidic) mud sitting at the bottom of the ocean. Yet this is important to understand, because if bacteria were to use up all the oxygen at the ocean floor, they would suddenly find it much harder to break down all the dead 'bodies' of the microscopic plants (phytoplankton) that live and grow in the sunlight at the ocean surface and sink down to depth when they die. I will therefore develop a computer model of chemical reactions to represent how hydrogen sulphide can turn the organic matter from phytoplankton into a much more resistant form in the sediments. Using this model I can firstly better understand the conditions that might produce the perfect rocks for producing oil (and gas). Together with a global carbon cycle and climate model, I will also utilize the geological record to help understand what is possible and how important the different modes of recovery are, and will investigate and compare the burial of these dead bodies in sulphidic mud during two past global warming events: Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum ('PETM') ~55 million years ago (Ma) and the Ocean Anoxic Events ('OAEs') of the early Jurassic (ca. 183 Ma - the Toarcian OAE). From all this, I expect to be able to understand better how increases in the amount of carbon being buried helps the Earth system recover from greenhouse climates and test whether the Earth system might have a special emergency mechanism - if climate gets too warm and oxygen starts to run out in the ocean - the production of hydrogen sulphide as oxygen starts to run out in the ocean and increased burial or organic matter.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/I021322/1,,,,,,,,University of Bristol,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15354850,,

Leaf anatomy and physiology changed markedly during canopy reinstation, and leaves produced in the second year (2010) were distinct from those produced later. Leaves produced in 2010 were thicker (all measures of leaf anatomy), yet more porous (increased intercellular airspace), causing specific leaf area also to be greater. Indicators of heterotrophic activity, leaf respiration rate and light compensation point, were twofold greater in 2010, whereas all measures of photosynthetic capacity were greatest in leaves produced in 2011 and 2012. Whilst stomatal density, vein density and leaf hydraulic conductance all progressively decreased with time, neither leaf water status nor carbon isotope discrimination were affected.

Natural gas, as an alternative to pollutant fuels such as coal, which is now widely used, could facilitate global transition to the age of renewable energy. Iran is one of the major emitters of CO2 in the world, and it is thus, crucial to move toward low-carbon economy in order to accomplish its commitment in reducing GHG emissions. This study evaluates Iran's natural gas industry development by reviewing reserves, production and consumption, infrastructures as well as natural gas agreements. The total proven natural gas reserves of Iran is estimated 33500 bcm by the end of 2015, where more than 60% of them are offshore. There exists 23 active fields in Iran and the largest of which is South Pars gas reservoirs in the Persian Gulf. The gross production of natural gas was 257623 million cubic meters in 2015 of which 80% was marketed. The current state of Iran's natural gas industry is assessed as an acceptable level due to massive reserves, high production capacity, wide transmission and distribution network and high penetration of natural gas in cities and villages. That is why natural gas has the highest contribution in the national energy mix, resulting in replacing petroleum fuels with natural gas to decrease CO2 emissions. However, in recent years, delays in implementing development projects of the natural gas industry made supplying domestic demand difficult during cold seasons. Furthermore, it negatively influenced the nation's gas export potential. Iran's natural gas industry faces some challenges including growing domestic demand, high energy loses in residential and commercial sectors and low efficiency of energy systems in industrial and power generation sectors. If challenges are solved, natural gas could serve as a bridge for transition toward the low-carbon future of Iran.",,,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,3,0,52,,,1364-0321,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tehran, Dept Renewable Energies & Environm, Fac New Sci & Technol, POB 14395-1561, Tehran, Iran",,,,2017-11-01,WOS:000410011500008,,

An online chromatography apparatus was used to determine CO2 solubility in steel-slag-enhanced seawater, and the thermodynamics and kinetics were studied. CO2 was more soluble in seawater with steel slag than that in seawater alone, and as the concentration of steel slag increased, the CO2 solubility increased and mass transfer coefficient increased, favoring CO2 absorption rate by seawater. CO2 solubility increased on average by 115.56% when the steel slag increased by 1.0%. Among steel slag components, MgO had the strongest ability to enhance CO2 capture. CO2 solubility of seawater with 0.4% MgO was 0.0044 at 25 degrees C and 0.3 MPa. In addition, the combination addition of MgO and CaO had a strong synergistic effect on CO2 capture by seawater. Fe2O3 had a more remarkable capacity to accelerate CO2 capture than other steel slag components.

The bowl has macroscopic openings in its sidewall, and its surface is first coated with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) and then with diffusion pump oil, which imparts exceptional hydrophobic, oleophilic, and high oil wettability properties. The use of a hydrogel makes it possible to obtain surface hydrophobicity and oleophilicity, while also being inexpensive, eco-friendly, and easy to fabricate. Using a prototype of the bowl and a small pump system, we demonstrate that oils with a broad range of viscosities (2.7-2000.0 cSt at 20-40 degrees C) are more rapidly and efficiently collected from the surface of both pure water and seawater than with any other reported technique. The hydrogel bowl can collect oil for more than one month without losing its efficiency and can be stored in oil for reuse. Therefore, such hydrogel bowls represent a new alternative to conventional oil spill remediation techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The N depletion may reflect large-scale differentiation events such as sequestration in Earth's core or massive blow off of Earth's early atmosphere, or alternatively the characteristics of a late-added volatile-rich veneer. As the behavior of N during early planetary differentiation processes is poorly constrained, we determined together the partitioning of N and C between Fe-N-C metal alloy and two different silicate melts (a terrestrial and a martian basalt). Conditions spanned a range of f(O2) from Delta IW-0.4 to Delta IW-3.5 at 1.2 to 3 GPa, and 1400 degrees C or 1600 degrees C, where Delta IW is the logarithmic difference between experimental 102 and that imposed by the coexistence of crystalline Fe and wustite.N partitioning (D-N(metal/silicate)) depends chiefly on f(O2), decreasing from 24 +/- 3 to 0.3 +/- 0.1 with decreasing f(O2)center dot D-N(metal/silicate) also decreases with increasing temperature and pressure at similar f(O2), though the effect is subordinate. In contrast, C partition coefficients (D-C(metal/silicate)) show no evidence of a pressure dependence but diminish with temperature. At 1400 degrees C, D-C(metal/silicate) partition coefficients increase linearly with decreasing f(O2) from 300 +/- 30 to 670 +/- 50. At 1600 degrees C, however, they increase from Delta IW-0.7 to Delta IW-2 (87 +/- 3 to 240 +/- 50) and decrease from Delta IW-2 to Delta IW-3.3 (99 +/- 6). Enhanced C in melts at high temperatures under reduced conditions may reflect stabilization of C-H species (most likely CH4). No significant compositional dependence for either N or C partitioning is evident, perhaps owing to the comparatively similar basalts investigated.At modestly reduced conditions (Delta IW-0.4 to -2.2), N is more compatible in core-forming metal than in molten silicate (1 <= D-N(metal/silicate) <= 24) while at more reduced conditions (Delta IW-2.2 to Delta IW-3.5), N becomes more compatible in the magma ocean than in the metal phase. In contrast, C is highly siderophile at all conditions investigated (100 <= D-C(metal/silicate) <= 700). Therefore, sequestration of volatiles in the core affects C more than N, and lowers the C:N ratio of the BSE. Consequently, the N depletion and the high C:N ratio of the BSE cannot be explained by core formation. Mass balance modeling suggests that core formation combined with atmosphere blow-off also cannot produce a non-metallic Earth with a C:N ratio similar to the BSE, but that the accretion of a C-rich late veneer can account for the observed high BSE C:N ratio.

Those goals intend to keep promoting and developing relevant activities in (i) fundamental/applied research in Earth Sciences; (ii) scientific and technical advanced training of post-graduate students, namely those involved in programs of the 2nd and 3rd cycles offered by the Geology Department of FCUL (GeoFCUL), where most of the CeGul’s researchers teach; (iii) consultancy and technical-scientific support to public and private entities; (iv) diffusion of Geology. Persistent incentives will continue to launch and consolidate potential to enhance: the scientific productivity; the internationalisation; the national cooperation and reinforcement of internal cooperation among Research Groups and with IDL; the improvement of external partnerships and interactions with industry and other stakeholders, seeking the diversification of financial sources and attraction of long-term contracts. These overall strategic guidelines are intended to: (i) increase expertise and team skills of the Unit; (ii) partly overcome the expected difficulties related to recruitment of young researchers and stable funding; (iii) increase the critical mass, keeping the quality and exigency levels; (iv) access to complementary analytical equipments, improving the existing multidisciplinary/systemic approaches to complex issues; (v) increase the economic impact and social relevance of research activities; (vi) improve the transfer of geoscientific knowledge to the non-geological community, so that it can play a stronger role in supporting policy and decision-making by Government and Society.Accordingly, the research planned will cling to specific aims oriented to the 2015-2020 cycle but as always based on firmly founded know-how, suitable research methods and approaches to emergent and innovative issues with scientific, social and economic impact. Transversely, the planed research may be outlined as follows:1) Improve multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and multiscale studies on exogenous geological processes, products and systems, from both the fossil geological record and modern contexts, pertaining to improve accuracy of using fossil and recent analogues for understanding key geological/palaeoclimatic settings, addressing also ongoing issues on Global Change and developing characterisation of natural resources under a sustainable management perspective. This objective requires the consolidation/development of two work-lines, though partially inter-related and sharing expertises, as imposed by the distinct physical nature and time realities of the study objects. The approaches will seek reinforcement through interaction with know-how within the scope of Climate Change and Geomagnetism.2) Undertake critical geological approaches to the structure and properties of Solid Earth, exploring also its interfaces with Hydrosphere, Biosphere and Atmosphere, improving the characterisation of fundamental biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes through interdisciplinary surveys, monitoring and modelling. This goal will involve, namely, studies on oceanic and continental magmatic activity, tectono-metamorphic and magmatic regimes in orogenic belts, and thermo-tectonic and geochemical constraints on ore-forming systems in distinct geodynamic frameworks. In addition, geochemical and geophysical studies applied to a range of interface topics are envisaged.3) Apply a systemic approach to issues related to the nature, potential impact, prevention adaptation and mitigation of geological hazards (e.g. landslides, extreme flooding events, water and sediment contamination), and to the sustainable use of geological resources (coastal areas, groundwater, oil and gas, ore deposits, rock and fossil units, landscapes, soils, urban subsoil). This requires addressing a range of topics, taking advantage of the many expertises existing within the present team and the enlarged one in future under the scope of the new IDL.4) Maximize recent investments in laboratory facilities and the inherent optimisation of data acquisition, through diversification of their potential applications in different research and industry fields. The existing facilities are partially shared with other RU (Creminer) also linked to the GeoFCUL and increasing collaboration will be favoured, more so as the latter RU will also be in IDL. The CeGUL intends to keep its long-term policy of strongly supporting the GeoFCUL library, opened to the pubic, and will maintain careful attention to advanced training, in strong connection with the GeoFCUL.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,PEst-OE/CTE/UI0263/2014,,,,,,,,Fundação da Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa,Fundação da Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15468391,,

During the experiments, the total carbonic acid concentration (Sigma CO2) in the fluid decreased from approximately 65 to 9 mmolikg. Carbonate minerals, magnesite, and subordinate amount of dolomite were formed via the water -rock interaction. The H-2 concentration in the fluid reached approximately 39 mmol/kg within 2736 h, which is relatively lower than the concentration generated by the reaction between olivine and a CO2-free NaCl solution at the same temperature. As seen in previous hydrothermal experiments using komatiite, ferrous iron incorporation into Mg-bearing carbonate minerals likely limited iron oxidation in the fluids and the resulting H-2 generation during the olivine alteration. Considering carbonate mineralogy over the temperature range of natural hydrothermal fields, H-2 generation is likely suppressed at temperatures below approximately 300 degrees C due to the formation of the Mg-bearing carbonates. Nevertheless, H-2 concentration in fluid at 300 degrees C could be still high due to the temperature dependency of magnetite stability in ultramafic systems. Moreover, the Mg-bearing carbonates may play a key role in the ocean-atmosphere system on the early Earth. Recent studies suggest that the subduction of carbonated ultramafic rocks may transport surface CO2 species into the deep mantle. This process may have reduced the huge initial amount of CO2 on the surface of the early Earth. Our approximate calculations demonstrate that the subduction of the Mg-bearing carbonates formed in komatiite likely played a crucial role as one of the CO2 carriers from the surface to the deep mantle, even in hot subduction zones.

Recovery was longest for spills with the following conditions: Cold climate; sheltered settings; thick oil on the marsh surface; light refined products with heavy loading; oils that formed persistent thick residues; and intensive treatment. Recovery was shortest for spills with the following conditions: Warm climate; light to heavy oiling of the vegetation only; medium crude oils; and less-intensive treatment. Recommendations are made for treatment based on the following oiling conditions: Free-floating oil on the water in the marsh; thicker oil (>0.5 cm) on marsh surface; thinner oil (<0.5 cm) on marsh surface; heavy oil loading on vegetation; and light to moderate oil loading on vegetation.

Results from the low-temperature N-2 adsorption and porosity measurement demonstrated that the variation trend of pore structure characteristics for the YY and GZ shale samples was quite different after reacting with slick water fracturing fluid. For YY shale, the specific surface area, total pore volume, and porosity increased after the reaction, whereas an opposite trend was observed in the GZ shale. Moreover, the fractal dimension analysis illustrated that the pore surface became less rough and the pore structure became more complex in the YY shale, whereas the degree of pore surface roughness and pore structure complexity of the GZ shale was reduced.

However, the modeling of a full-depth system has become difficult presently; no tank facility is sufficiently large to perform the testing of a complete FPS with compliant mooring in 1000 m to 3000 m depth, within reasonable limits of model scale. Until recently, the most feasible procedure to meet this challenge seems to be the so-called hybrid model testing technique. To implement this technique, the first and important step is to design the equivalent water depth truncated mooring system. In this work, the optimization design of the equivalent water depth truncated mooring system in hybrid model testing for deep sea platforms is investigated. During the research, the similarity of static characteristics between the truncated and full depth system is mainly considered. The optimization mathematical model for the equivalent water depth truncated system design is set up by using the similarity in numerical value of the static characteristics between the truncated system and the full depth one as the objective function. The dynamic characteristic difference between the truncated and full depth mooring system can be minished by selecting proper design rule. To calculate the static characteristics of the mooring system, the fourth order Runge-Kutta method is used to solve the static equilibrium equation of the single mooring line. After the static characteristic of the single mooring line is calculated, the static characteristic of the whole mooring system is calculated with Lagrange numerical interpolation method. The mooring line material database is established and the standard material name and the diameter of the mooring line are selected as the primary key. The improved simulated annealing algorithm for continual & discrete variables and the improved complex algorithm for discrete variables are employed to perform the optimization calculation. The C++ programming language is used to develop the computer program according to the object-oriented programming idea. To perform the optimization calculation with the two algorithms mentioned above respectively and the better result is selected as the final one. To examine the developed program, an example of equivalent water depth truncated mooring system optimum design calculation on a 100,000-t, turret mooring FPSO in water depth of 320 m are performed to obtain the conformation parameters of the truncated mooring system, in which the truncated water depth is 160 m. The model test under some typical environment conditions are performed for both the truncated and the full depth system with model scale factor lambda=80. After comparing the corresponding results from the test of the truncated system with those from the full depth system test, it's found that the truncated mooring system design in this work is successful.",,,,,,,,,18,9,0,0,0,0,25,,,1672-1799,,,,,,,,,,,"Zhejiang Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R ChinaChina Jiliang Univ, Coll Metrol Technol & Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",,,,2009-02-01,WOS:000262684700016,,

However, there typically is limited data concerning the specific structural design and tank arrangement of ships operating in a given area. Moreover, there is uncertainty about the accident scenarios potentially emerging from ship encounters. This paper proposes a Bayesian network (BN) model for reasoning under uncertainty for the assessment of accidental cargo oil outflow in a ship-ship collision where a product tanker is struck. The BN combines a model linking impact scenarios to damage extent with a model for estimating the tank layouts based on limited information regarding the ship. The methodology for constructing the model is presented and output for two accident scenarios is shown. The discussion elaborates on the issue of model validation, both in terms of the BN and in light of the adopted uncertainty/bias-based risk perspective. (C) 2013 The Authors.

It primarily consists of sandstone intervals that were deposited in a shallow marine, wave-dominated shoal environment and appears deceivingly simple on wireline logs. Deeper investigation finds that the clastic reservoir is actually rich in carbonate concretions with varying geometries and percentages. These carbonate concretions change from scattered ovoid to discontinuous thin beds alternating with bioturbated intervals throughout the structurally-separated fault blocks of the field. Evidence supports the concretions acting as baffles rather than barriers to flow within the reservoir.The main Woodruff rock types were categorized based on petrographic description of cores taken from different locations and fault blocks within Tinsley Field, and this approach helped to highlight the impact of diagenesis on the reservoir quality throughout the field. The probe permeameter data of the cored wells provided a discrete, high-resolution method to determine net reservoir sand. Calibration of probe permeability measurements from the cores with wireline log-based permeability provided a good control on the petrophysical properties throughout the field.The uncertainty related to distribution of reservoir properties was addressed by building a sector model representing one of the Tinsley fault blocks. Population of the properties was controlled by semi-variogram ranges. Although thickness and percentage of pay versus non-pay remained uncertain, validation of the sector model was achieved by matching the static properties and calculated pore volumes to the production history. The results of the flow simulation model demonstrated that the geological model had a reasonable distribution of properties to reflect actual reservoir behavior.The Woodruff geological model provides the foundation for detailed reservoir simulation study that can enhance the understanding of fluid flow within the reservoir intervals.

It was observed that a cold boundary and consequent low oil temperature increased the thermal inertia of the oil/mixture and consequently the time to sustained ignition also increased. As the water content in the ANS water-in-oil mixture increased, the critical heat flux for ignition was found to increase. This is mainly because of an increase in the thermal conductivity of the mixture with the addition of saltwater.

However, there is a lack of a comprehensive understanding on the variation in carbon storage across TMF compartments [namely aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), and soil organic matter] along altitudinal and environmental gradients and their potential trade-offs. This study aims to: 1) understand how carbon stocks vary along altitudinal gradients in Andean TMFs, and; 2) determine the influence of climate, particularly precipitation seasonality, on the distribution of carbon stocks across different forest compartments. The study was conducted in sixty 0.1 ha plots along two altitudinal gradients at the Podocarpus National Park (Ecuador) and Rio Abiseo National Park (Peru). At each plot, we calculated the amount of carbon in AGB (i.e. aboveground carbon stock, AGC), BGB (i.e. belowground carbon stock, BGC), and soil organic matter (i.e. soil organic carbon stock, SOC). The mean total carbon stock was 244.76 +/- 80.38 Mg ha(-1) and 211.51 +/- 46.95 Mg ha(-1) in the Ecuadorian and Peruvian plots, respectively. Although AGC, BGC, and SOC showed different partitioning patterns along the altitudinal gradient both in Ecuador and Peru, total carbon stock did not change with altitude in either site. The combination of annual mean temperature and precipitation seasonality explained differences in the observed patterns of carbon stocks across forest compartments between the two sites. This study suggests that the greater precipitation seasonality of colder, higher altitudes may promote faster turnover rates of organic matter and nutrients and, consequently, less accumulation of SOC but greater AGC and BGC, compared to those sites with lesser precipitation seasonality. Our results demonstrate the capacity of TMFs to store substantial amounts of carbon and suggest the existence of a trade-off in carbon stocks among forest compartments, which could be partly driven by differences in precipitation seasonality, especially under the colder temperatures of high altitudes.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,13,1,28,,,1664-462X,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, Madrid, SpainUniv Autonoma Madrid, Dept Geol & Geoquim, Madrid, SpainUniv Tecn Particular Loja, Inst Ecol, Loja, EcuadorUniv Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen, ScotlandPontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Inst Ciencias Nat Terr & Energias Renovables, Lima, PeruUniv Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol, Area Bot, Madrid, SpainUniv Autonoma Madrid, Ctr Invest Biodiversidad & Cambio Global CIBC UAM, Madrid, Spain",,,,2020-04-21,WOS:000524689300001,32194581,

It was therefore appropriate that an epic poet of the time should record the achievements of his contemporaries for posterity. That poet was Luís Vaz de Camões (c. 1524-1580), the creator of the timeless epic Os Lusíadas (The Lusiads). In this heroic poem Camões, through his brilliant depiction of Adamastor, created an enduring myth. There are different theories about Camões's motivation in creating the Adamastor myth. Vasco da Gama's battle against the howling south-easter off the Cape in November 1497 undoubtedly inspired the poet more than half a century later. The similarity between Camões's fatal love for a lady-in-waiting at the royal court in Lisbon and his consequent exile to the East and that of Adamastor's love for Thetis and his exile to the southern tip of Africa seems to be more than mere coincidence. When the Sao Bento, in which Camões sailed to the East in 1553, rounded the Cape, the sea was particularly stormy and the south-easter caused heavy clouds to hang over Table Mountain. This frightening personal experience had a profound effect on Camões, and thus the giant Adamastor probably took shape in his agitated mind. Camões was eminently suited to being the writer of the epic of Portugal because he not only knew the history of his country but was also well versed in Greek and Roman mythology, which must have inspired the creation of Adamastor. In Os Lusíadas Camões depicts both the glory and the decline of the Portuguese empire. The essence of the narrative is Vasco da Gama's voyage to India, but the poet has ingeniously woven the earlier history of Portugal into the course of the narrative by making Da Gama relate the history of his people to the friendly king of Malindi on the eastern coast of Africa. In Canto V, stanzas 37 to 61, Camões tells the story of Adamastor. When Da Gama's fleet approaches the Cape a terrifying cloud appears overhead, taking the shape of a powerful, monstrous being. The misshapen, bearded figure threatens the mariners who sail the seas over which he has long held solitary sway. He has a grudge against the Portuguese because he envies them their freedom of movement, their boldness and their excellence. He predicts disasters, shipwrecks and loss of life for those who dare to sail round the Cape of Storms. Adamastor tells of his revenge on Dias for being the first to sail these waters, the grave he has prepared for De Almeida, and the fate that will overtake Sousa de Sepúlveda and other castaways on the South African coast. While Adamastor continues his prophecies about the misfortunes awaiting the Portuguese, Da Gama interrupts him brusquely and asks him who in fact he is. Adamastor with a mighty roar and in a voice heavy with bitterness replies that he is the great hidden cape called the Cape of Storms by the Portuguese. He is one of the giants, a child from the marriage of Uranus and Earth, who rebelled against the gods of Olympus. He tells them the pitiful tale of his love for Thetis, the sea nymph whom he wooed but who spurned him because of his repulsive appearance. Because of his rebellion against the gods and his illicit love for Thetis, Adamastor was punished by the gods. They changed him into a rugged mountain at the southern tip of Africa, where he has to guard the southern seas and bring death to the sons of Luso who want to sail past him. In Adamastor Camões created a new mythological figure, the only great figure added to mythology since the classical period. By placing him at the Cape of Storms the poet brought southern Africa into the realm of the classical gods. According to the South African author Stephen Gray the figure of Adamastor is at the root of all subsequent white semiology invented to cope with the African experience. Adamastor is ominous and hostile and is observed across a divide: he belongs to an older but conquered culture and may annihilate the new European enlightenment if he is allowed within its borders. Vasco da Gama and Adamastor, as depicted by Camões, were therefore, in Gray's view, the beginning of the racist mythology on which white supremacy in South Africa is based. The Portuguese author António Figueiredo differs from this viewpoint and points out that Os Lusíadas and the Adamastor legend are above purely human and racial antagonisms and that they serve rather as a symbol of man's defiance of the elements. The Adamastor myth represents the triumph of the Portuguese over the untamed forces of nature as well as their reward which lay in their becoming the rulers of the oceans. Os Lusíadas has been translated into many languages. Although parts of it were translated into Afrikaans by André P. Brink, D.P.M Botes and René Immelman, it has never been done in verse form. The section relating to Adamastor (Canto V, 37-61) was translated for this article.",,,"In sy epiese gedig Os Lusíadas het Camões (ca. 1524-1580) tegelykertyd die glorie en ondergang van die Portugese ryk verwoord. Hy was 'n nasionale digter en sy meesterwerk is van die begin tot die einde aan die verhaal van sy heroïese volk gewy. Die kern van die verhaal is Vasco da Gama se reis na Indië (1497-1498) en is gegrond op die skeepsjoernaal wat Álvaro Velho aan boord van die São Rafael in Da Gama se vloot gehou het. Maar die digter het die voorafgaande geskiedenis van Portugal in sy epos ingewerk deur Da Gama die geskiedenis aan die heerser van Malindi te laat vertel. Die gebeure ná sy reis word gedeeltelik deur Da Gama self verwoord, maar ook deur die sinistere voorspellings van Adamastor, die gees van die Stormkaap. Camões vertel in sy Os Lusíadas die verhaal van Adamastor in kanto V, stansas 37 tot 61. Adamastor verskyn aan die Portugese in 'n vreesaanjaende vorm, vervloek hulle omdat hulle sy oseaan bevaar en voorspel dood en noodlot vir toekomstige togte. Hy vertel ook aan hulle sy verhaal en hoekom hy deur die gode na die suidpunt van Afrika verban is. Os Lusíadas is in vele tale vertaal. Slegs kort gedeeltes is in Afrikaans oorgesit en 'n poging is nog nie aangewend om die Adamastor-gedeelte in versvorm te vertolk nie.

Several strategies can be used to reduce the production costs of these surfactants and make the process more environmentally friendly. In this study, we combined some of these strategies to produce the rhamnolipid-type biosurfactant, including the use of the genetically modified strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa-estA, an industrial coproduct as a carbon source, a simple and low-cost medium, and a simple downstream process. The process resulted in a high yield (17.6 g L-1), even using crude glycerin as the carbon source, with substrate in product conversion factor (Y-RML/s) of 0.444. The cell-free supernatant (CFS) was not toxic to Anemia salina and selected mammalian cell lineages, suggesting that it can be used directly in the environment without further purification steps. Qualitative analysis showed that CFS has excellent dispersion in the oil-displacement test, emulsifying (IE24 = 65.5%), and tensoactive properties. When salinity, temperature and pressure were set to seawater conditions, the values for interfacial tension between crude oil and water were below 1.0 mN m(-1). Taken together, these results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a nontoxic crude rhamnolipid product, with high productivity, to replace petroleum-based surfactants in oil spill cleanups and other environmental applications.

Results showed maximum ion exchange capacity (IEC) value was recorded in case of aminated chitosan (7.6 meq/g), while lower IEC value was obtained for nonanyl chitosan schiffbase (2.5 meq/g). Furthermore, the contact angle data indicates that nonanyl chitosan schiffbase exhibit hydrophobic and oleophilic characters and recorded maximum values at 127 degrees, 36 degrees using water and crude oil droplet.

The CS is grafted into the carbonaceous materials like graphene oxide, multi-walled carbon nanotubes etc. to provide the large surface area, high porosity and a large number of amine group which facilitates the adsorption of CO2 gas. CS and carbonaceous materials undergo crosslinking by using cross-linker reagents, and freeze-drying technique to yield CS based aerogels with ordered porous structures. Crosslinking between CS and carbonaceous materials was confirmed by FT-IR. Physical properties of the CS-based aerogels were studied using SEM, TGA, XRD, BET isotherm analysis. The adsorption capacity of CO2 gas by CS grafted graphene oxide aerogels is around 0.257 mmol g(-1) at 1 bar, that is significantly higher in comparison to the adsorption capacity of pure CS. We believe that this study helps to reduce the cost of adsorbents due to the large availability of marine waste (CS) and thus aims to reduce the anthropogenic CO2 gas at low cost, favourable temperature and pressure as compared to previously reported.

UAVSAR is a fully polarimetric L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor for obtaining data at high spatial resolutions. Starting a month prior to the UAVSAR collections, visual observations confirmed oil impacts along shorelines within northeastern Barataria Bay waters in eastern coastal Louisiana. UAVSAR data along several flight lines over Barataria Bay were collected on 23 June 2010, including the repeat flight line for which data were collected in June 2009. Our analysis of calibrated single-look complex data for these flight lines shows that structural damage of shoreline marsh accompanied by oil occurrence manifested as anomalous features not evident in pre-spill data. Freeman-Durden (FD) and Cloude-Pottier (CP) decompositions of the polarimetric data and Wishart classifications seeded with the FD and CP classes also highlighted these nearshore features as a change in dominant scattering mechanism. All decompositions and classifications also identify a class of interior marshes that reproduce the spatially extensive changes in backscatter indicated by the pre- and post-spill comparison of multi-polarization radar backscatter data. FD and CP decompositions reveal that those changes indicate a transform of dominant scatter from primarily surface or volumetric to double or even bounce. Given supportive evidence that oil-polluted waters penetrated into the interior marshes, it is reasonable that these backscatter changes correspond with oil exposure; however, multiple factors prevent unambiguous determination of whether UAVSAR detected oil in interior marshes.",,,,,,,,,48,1,0,0,18,0,51,,,,2072-4292,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Natl Wetlands Res Ctr, Lafayette, LA USAIAP World Serv Inc, Cape Canaveral, FL 32920 USAASci Corp Inc, Mclean, VA 22101 USACALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA",IAP World Serv IncASci Corp Inc,,,2011-12-01,WOS:000306755300005,,

The seven sods were developed to different genetic stages.The carbon content of the bulk soils ranged from 8.7 to 19.7 g kg(-1). Clay mineralogy was confirmed to be constant, with illite contents > 80 %. Both, specific surface area (SSA, BET-N-2-method) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) of bulk soils after carbon removal were better predictors of carbon content than clay content or dithionite-extractable iron. SSA explained 55 % and CEC 54 % of the variation in carbon content. The carbon loadings of the soils were between 0.57 and 1.06 mg C m(-2), and therefore in the monolayer equivalent (ME) level. The increase in SSA after carbon removal (DeltaSSA) was significantly and positively related to carbon content (r(2) = 0.77). Together with CEC of carbon-free samples, DeltaSSA explained 90 % of the variation in carbon content.Clay (< 2 mum) and fine silt fractions (2-6.3 mum) contained 68-82 % of the bulk soil organic carbon. A significantly positive relationship between carbon content in the clay fraction and in the bulk soil was observed (r(2) = 0.95). The carbon pools of the clay and fine silt fractions were characterized by differences in C/N ratio, delta(13)C ratio, and enrichment factors for carbon and nitrogen. Organic matter in clay fractions seems to be more altered by microbes than organic matter in fine silt fractions.The results imply that organic matter accumulates in the fractions of smallest size and highest surface area, apparently intimately associated with the mineral phase. The amount of cations adhering to the mineral surface and the size of a certain and specific pail of the surface area (DeltaSSA) are the mineral phase properties which affect the content of the organic carbon in loess derived arable surface soils in Central Germany most.

The fabrication of a superhydrophobic sponge capable of efficiently separating oil from water was achieved by imitating or mimicking nature's designs. The original PU sponge was coated with zinc oxide (ZnO), stearic acid (SA) and iron oxide particles (Fe3O4) via a facile and environmentally friendly method. After each treatment, the properties of the modified sponge were characterized, and the changes in wettability were examined. Water contact angle (WCA) measurements confirmed the excellent superhydrophobicity of the material withhigh static WCA of 161 degrees andlow dynamic WCA (sliding WCA of 7 degrees and shedding WCA of 8 degrees). The fabricated sponge showed high efficiency in separation (over 99%) of different oils from water. Additionally, the fabricated PU@ZnO@Fe3O4@SA sponge could be magnetically guided to quickly absorb oil floating on the water surface. Moreover, the fabricated sponge showed excellent stability and reusability in terms of superhydrophobicity and oil absorption capacity. The durable, magnetic and superhydrophobic properties of the fabricated sponge render it applicable to the cleanup of marine oil spills and other oil-water separation issues, with eco-friendly recovery of the oil by simple squeezing process.",,,,,,,,,39,2,0,0,7,0,41,,,2045-2322,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Ulsan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Daehak Ro 93, Ulsan 680749, South Korea",,,,2017-12-13,WOS:000417796000040,29235525,

However, there are latent risks in which carbon dioxide (CO2) could migrate from the deep saline formations to shallower aquifers. In the event of a significant CO2 leakage to an underground source of drinking water, CO2 will dissolve in the water, thereby increasing its acidity, which could potentially enhance the solubility of various aquifer constituents, including hazardous compounds, subsequently compromising groundwater quality due to increased concentration of aqueous metals. In this paper we explore the possibility of detecting such leakage by the use of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The experiments were conducted in calcium chloride solution at three pressures of 10, 50, and 120 bar. To evaluate the direct effect of elevated CO2 on the intensity of calcium emission lines (422.67 and 393.37 nm), we also performed experiments with pure nitrogen (N-2) gas, offering large water solubility contrast. We found that when performed in presence of CO2, LIBS showed only a modest decrease in Ca emission intensity from 10 to 120 bar compared to N-2. These results indicate that LIBS is a viable tool for measuring brine/water contents in high-pressure CO2 environment and can be applied for monitoring CO2 leakage and displaced brine migration.",,,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,6,0,18,,,0003-7028,1943-3530,,,,,,,,,,"NETL RUA, Pittsburgh, PA 15236 USACarnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USAUS DOE, Natl Energy Technol Lab, Morgantown, WV 26507 USAMississippi State Univ, Inst Clean Energy Technol, Starkville, MS 39759 USAKing Saud Univ, Dept Phys, Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaNatl Energy Technol Lab, URS Washington Div, Pittsburgh, PA 15236 USA",NETL RUA,,,2014-09-17,WOS:000340865400010,25226253,

At each plot, surface fuel carbon was quantified by type, namely coarse, small, and fine woody material, duff, and litter, and carbon mass by fuel type was compared among severity classes. Total surface fuel carbon did not differ significantly between burned and unburned plots; however, there was significantly less duff and litter carbon in burned plots.

The objective of this study was to determine the biodegradation of dispersant surfactants in cold seawater, relevant for deep sea or Arctic conditions. Biotransformation of the surfactants dioctyl-sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), Tween 80, Tween 85, and alpha/beta-ethylhexylsulfosuccinate (EHSS, expected DOSS hydrolysis product) in the commercial dispersants Corexit 9500, Dasic Slickgone NS and Finasol OSR52 were determined. The biotransformation studies of the surfactants were performed in natural seawater at 5 degrees C over a period of 54 days without oil present. The surfactants were tested at concentrations of 1, 5, and 50 mg/L, the lower concentration being as close as possible to expected field concentrations. Experiments with dispersants concentrations of 1 mg/L resulted in rapid biotransformation of Tween 80 and Tween 85, with depletion after 8 days, while DOSS showed rapid biotransformation after a lag period of 16 days. The degradation half-life of DOSS increased from 4.1 days to >500 days as Corexit 9500 concentrations went from 1 mg/L to 50 mg/L, emphasizing the importance of performing experiments at dispersant concentrations as close as possible to environmentally relevant concentrations.

Oil was collected from the surface of the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon spill and exposed to simulated sunlight in thin films over water. Photochemical production of hydroxyl radical was measured with benzoic acid as a selective chemical probe in the aqueous layer. Total hydroxyl radical formation was studied using high benzoic acid concentrations and varying exposure time. The total amount of hydroxyl radical produced in 24 h irradiations of thin oil films over Gulf of Mexico water and pure water were 3.7 x 10(-7) and 4.2 x 10(-7) moles respectively. Steady state concentrations of hydroxyl radical were measured using a competition kinetics approach. Hydroxyl radical concentrations of 1.2 x 10(-16) to 2.4 x 10(-16) M were observed for seawater and pure water under oil films. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanomaterials were added to the system in an effort to determine if the photocatalyst would enhance oil photodegradation. The addition of TiO2 nanoparticles dramatically changed the observed formation rate of hydroxyl radical in the systems with NP water at pH 3, showing increased formation rate in many cases. With photocatalyst, the steady state concentration of radical decreased, predominantly due to an increase in the hydroxyl radical scavenging rate with oxide present. This study illustrates that oil is a strong and important source of hydroxyl radical when exposed to sunlight. The fate of oil and other dissolved species following oil spills will be heavily dependent on the formation and fate of hydroxyl radical. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

B.C. was to become. To do so, we first briefly describe the typological and physical characteristics of the lead stock and interpret the double Iberian inscription, baitolo, with which it was marked, probably a place-name, either that of the Ibero-Roman town of baitolo/Baetulo, which issued coins with the same legend (baitolo) in the second quarter of the 1st c. B.C., or the name of the nearby river, the modern Bess.(2) Subsequently, we contextualize the lead stock within the corpus of Greco-Roman lead stocks to show that no other specimen, either among stocks or any instrument or component of a ship's naval architecture, is known to have an inscription in the Iberian language. To contextualize the artifact, we will turn our attention to the native character of baitolo's population, always from a linguistic perspective, and discuss its importance as a key centre in the wine trade. Thereafter, we make an epigraphic and archaeological re-assessment of the prior evidence for the participation of the indigenous peoples of NE Hispania in all the phases (whether land or maritime) of the chaine operatoire that resulted in the production and commercialization of large amounts of wine for Narbonne and elsewhere. First, we reconsider all the Iberian inscriptions that have a maritime context or that can be related to the production and commercialization of wine. Second, we examine the archaeological evidence, especially shipwrecks, suggesting that Iberian-speaking individuals during the 1st c. B.C. owned ships and participated in trade by sea, an activity that can now be confirmed thanks to the new lead stock (fig. 1), which is of small dimensions (77 cm long, 11 cm high, 8 cm in width in the central box) and of modest weight (25.9 kg).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1047-7594,2331-5709,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Victoria, Dept Greek & Roman Studies, Victoria, BC, CanadaUniv Barcelona, Dept Filol Llatina, Barcelona, Spain",,,,2020-10-27,WOS:000577139100017,,

This is particularly true for pyrogenic carbon (PyC) which is considered long-lasting in soil environments. With a goal to characterize how PyC responds to climate-dependent erosion and deposition processes, two hillslopes from SE Australia, differing in climate (MAP: 549 vs. 815 mm) and vegetation but with similar topography were selected for this study. We examined the colluvial soils that include A and B horizons on eroding (convex) and depositional (convergent) areas within each hillslope. Mid-infrared measurements with a partial least squares regression model were adopted to quantify the size and distribution of SOC fractions (i.e., particulate organic carbon (POC) fraction, humus organic carbon (HOC) and resistant organic carbon (ROC; representing PyC fraction) along the two hillslopes. These SOC fractions were examined with respect to climate, topographic position and soil depth. Total SOC was dominated by HOC (44 to 88%) followed by PyC (7 to 37%) and POC (0 to 37%). Effects of topography on inventories of PyC were more strongly expressed in the drier hillslope (eroding vs. depositional: 0.39 vs. 1.73 kg m(-2)) than the wetter hillslope (eroding vs. depositional: 1.14 vs. 2.46 kg m(-2)), which also illustrates that climatic effects on soil PyC differ between eroding and depositional hillslope areas. In contrast, relative contributions of PyC to SOC showed less systematic variation with topography (6.9-36.8% in eroding soils vs. 6.9-37.3% in depositional soils) and climate (6.9-36.8% at drier site vs. 6.9-37.3% at wetter site), which together with other laboratory and field data suggest that erosion may not preferentially transport PyC over other organic carbon forms or that erosional PyC flux may not be large enough to alter SOC concentration and distribution into fractions.

However, the current research on hydrates risk prevention during deepwater drilling is still insufficient. In this work, a novel hydrate formation-blockage risk assessment method in wellbore is proposed. Firstly, a new hydrate formation region (HFR) prediction model consists of mass, momentum and energy balance equations was established and was verified on a deepwater gas well in South China Sea. Secondly, the wellbore blockage risk in different drilling stages is evaluated and the prediction results were in good agreement with field results. Finally, economical-effective hydrate inhibition measures are proposed to ensure the safety and efficiency of deepwater drilling. The results show that the increase of gas invasion rate, drilling fluid injection temperature and drilling fluid circulation rate are helpful to shorten HFR. In this study, the total length of HFR can be reduced by 59.26% when the gas invasion rate increases from 0 to 14 L/s, while the total HFR can be reduced to 74.93% when the drilling fluid circulation rate increases from 0.01 to 0.09 L/s. Increasing drilling fluid circulation temperature is the most direct and effective measure to reduce HFR and the HFR in annulus will disappear when drilling fluid circulation temperature rises above 36 degrees C. Due to the limitation of gas hydrate induction period and multi-phase flow characteristics, the wellbore plugging risk in drilling fluid circulation stage is very low, while the hydrate blockage risk in well shut-in stage is high relatively. Meantime, properly increasing drilling fluid circulation rate and injection temperature, choosing appropriate drilling balance mode during drilling fluid circulation stage, reasonable controlling the wellbore annulus pressure, optimizing shut-in time and injecting appropriate inhibitors during well shut-in stage can effectively ensure the completion of safe-economic-efficient deepwater gas wells drilling.",,,,,,,,,12,2,0,0,0,0,14,,,0920-4105,1873-4715,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Petr, State Key Lab Petr Resources & Prospecting, Beijing 102249, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Petr, Coll Safety & Ocean Engn, Beijing 102249, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Petr, Coll Petr Engn, Beijing 102249, Peoples R ChinaUniv Texas Austin, Dept Petr & Geosysterns Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Petr Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,,,2019-08-02,WOS:000474691800060,,

Exceeding the recommended pour rate overloads the cleaning capacity of modern harvesters and increases EM in the cane supply. To attempt to counterbalance the EM issue, it is usual to increase fan speeds above those recommended, resulting in greater cane toss. Use of HBP recommendations across the industry is low and full HBP adoption would substantially increase industry revenue. To address this, 43 replicated harvesting trials and workshops were undertaken in the 2017 harvest season across 12 sugarcane regions between Maryborough and Mossman. The performance of settings recommended by HBP were compared with each harvesting operation's standard practice by assessing yield, CCS, bin mass, EM, fibre, sugar loss and revenue. To highlight the strong relationship between cane loss and excessive pour rates and fan speeds, treatments with higher pour rates and fan speeds and lower pour rates and fan speeds were also trialled. Results were presented to each harvesting group to inform their decision-making and promote HBP adoption. Cane loss, production and revenue data from 28 replicated and randomised trials were analysed to identify differences between industry standard harvesting practices and those recommended by HBP. We found that harvesters are typically operated at ground and fan speeds that ore on average 1 km/h and 95 rpm above those recommended. The higher ground speed delivered an additional 22 t/h of cane into the machine on average but overloaded the cleaning capacity of the harvester. While the higher fan speed helped to remove the additional EM entering the machine, it also removed additional cane through the extractor with most being disintegrated, making it invisible to stakeholders. Testing indicated that mean sugar loss out of the extractor was increased by 0.15 t/ha compared with HBP settings, while there were no significant differences in EM or bin mass. Due to the additional cane being lost, less cone was delivered to the mill per hectare. Mill results across all trials identified that mean cane and sugar yields for the recommended practice were 5 t cane/ha (5.4%) and 0.8 t sugar/ha (5.7%) higher than standard practice. Neither CCS nor fibre levels were significantly different. The increased cane and sugar yields generated by the recommended settings boosted mean total grower revenue by $220/ha, equating to $173/ha after subtracting the additional harvesting costs (including fuel) and levies. Extrapolating these findings across the Australian green-cane-harvested area, full adoption of the recommended practices could deliver an additional 1.3 Mt of cane and 202,000 t of sugar valued at over $86 million for industry ($57 million in additional revenue for growers alone).",,,,,"Annual Conference of the Australian-Society-of-Sugar-Cane-Technologists (ASSCT) / Congress of the International-Society-of-Sugar-Cane-Technologists - Plenary, Agricultural Engineering, AgronomyAnnual Conference of the Australian-Society-of-Sugar-Cane-Technologists (ASSCT) / Congress of the International-Society-of-Sugar-Cane-Technologists - Plenary, Agricultural Engineering, Agronomy","APR 30-MAY 03, 2019APR 30-MAY 03, 2019",Australian Soc Sugar Cane Technologists; Int Soc Sugar Cane TechnologistsAustralian Soc Sugar Cane Technologists; Int Soc Sugar Cane Technologists,"Univ So Queensland, Toowoomba, AUSTRALIAUniv So Queensland, Toowoomba, AUSTRALIA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0020-8841,,,,,,,,,,,"Sugar Res Australia Ltd, Ingham, Qld 4850, AustraliaSugar Res Australia Ltd, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, AustraliaQueensland Dept Agr & Fisheries, Townsville, Qld 4810, AustraliaSugar Res Australia Ltd, Mackay, Qld 4740, Australia",Sugar Res Australia LtdSugar Res Australia LtdQueensland Dept Agr & FisheriesSugar Res Australia Ltd,,,2020-09-15,WOS:000564359700012,,

Moreover, the large scale burning of such fuels for the production of electrical energy or in industry/transport results in a significant rising of the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere and therefore a rising of global temperatures. Research and development regarding alternative energy sources such as e.g. nuclear fusion is proceeding but mankind also becomes more aware of the sun as being a giant fusion reactor, already at their free disposition and able to act as a lasting and sustainable energy source. The sun in fact delivers continuously about 89,000 TW of usable insolation (photons) power to our planet while the actual global power consumption is about 15 TW. From this point of view, the sun is thus able to provide about 6000 times the world's energy demand, thus highlighting the enormous potential of solar energy from such numbers in a very obvious way. A major disadvantage of insolation energy of course is its discontinuous and fluctuating availability during daytime. To circumvent such, a solution could eventually be found in the storage of solar power as osmotic energy in highly concentrated salt solutions. The development of salinity gradient power (SGP) based on reverse electrodialysis (SGP-RED) could therefore possibly become in important alternative approach. When combined with classic or solar power based seawater desalination technologies, the resulting hybrid system could well be a candidate for the simultaneous production of potable water and electrical energy. The concentration of the brine from the seawater desalination unit (SWDU) could be substantially increased by using solar energy while also producing additional sweet water (condensate). Electricity could then be produced from the mixing energy of the highly concentrated brine and seawater, by using the principle of reverse electrodialysis (RED).

Transport of carbon dioxide in offshore pipelines involves high pressure and low temperatures, conditions which may lead to formation of hydrates from residual water dissolved in carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide. The critical question is whether the water at certain temperatures and pressures will drop out as liquid droplets first, and then form hydrates, or alternatively, adsorb on the pipeline surfaces, and subsequently form hydrates heterogeneously. In this work, we used several different basis sets of density functional theory in ab initio calculations to estimate the charge distribution of hematite (the dominating component of rust) crystals. These rust particles were embedded in water and chemical potential for adsorbed water molecules was estimated through thermodynamic integration and compared to similar estimates for water clusters of the same size. While the generated charges were not unique, the use of high order approximations and different basis sets provides a range of likely charge distributions. Values obtained for the chemical potential of water in different surroundings indicated that it would be thermodynamically favorable for water to adsorb on hematite, and that evaluation of potential carbon dioxide hydrate formation conditions and kinetics should be based on this formation mechanism. Depending on the basis set and approximations, the estimated gain for water to adsorb on the hematite surface rather than condense as droplets varied between -1.7 kJ mole(-1) and -3.4 kJ mole(-1). The partial charge distribution on the hematite surface is incompatible with the hydrate structure, and thus hydrates will be unable to attach to the surface. The behavior of water outside the immediate vicinity of hematite (beyond 3 4 diameters) closely resembled that of bulk liquid. This indicates that it will be able to form hydrates with readily available carbon dioxide. Thus hematite may still act as adsorption medium in heterogeneous hydrate formation just a few water diameters away from its surface. Theoretical estimates were compared to experimental measurements of water content in carbon dioxide co-existing with liquid water, adsorbed water and hydrate.",,,,,,,,,43,4,0,0,1,0,46,,,1463-9076,1463-9084,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bergen, Inst Fysikk & Teknologi, N-5007 Bergen, Norway",,,,2012-04-04,WOS:000301235200014,22354372,

We use a commercially available life-cycle assessment (LCA) software to conduct a life-cycle inventory of airborne emissions from the ship fuel use. Our findings indicate possible improvement in total fuel-life-cycle GHG emissions from the use of LNG as alternative fuel to power ships.

Both ships exhibit great reduction in the emissions of NOx (38-39%) and CO (42-43%). The reduction is much more remarkable in SO2 (99.8%) and PM10 (97.5%).

Leaks can cost industries millions of dollars in loss of energy, while increasing emissions, creating safety hazards, and lowering the reliability of operations. Valves and piping systems can fail in a number of ways. Pipelines are widely used for transportation of fluids like oil & natural gas over long distances to the power plants, public supplies and various industries due to safety, efficiency and low cost. High pressure pipelines are generally buried below the ground level for safety, economic and environmental purposes. For smooth and safe operation of pipeline, there are some associated facilities underground as well above ground facilities like Valves, IJ, Fittings, Launcher & Receiver known as pipeline system. To maintain the integrity of the pipeline system, these facilities need periodic maintenance for their effective operability up to their design life. Valves are one the critical component of the pipeline system and failure of it may cause serious hazard and reduce the control over the various parameters like flow & pressure in the pipeline. Shutting down to repair the leak means a loss in associated industry's production leading to revenue loss.Darod - Jafarabad Pipeline (DJPL) is one the Natural Gas Pipeline laid by Gujarat State Petronet Limited (GSPL) to transport natural gas in the coastal region of Saurashtra in Gujarat. DJPL is a 212 KM long pipeline with 10 nos. of SV stations. There was leakage observed from bolted body of Ball Valve installed at Intermediate Pigging Station (IPS) and SV-6 of DJPL and these valves are butt welded and in upstream side which need shutdown of pipeline for maintenance or replacement. Maintenance of valve becomes critical, if there is gas leakage from valve body and the pipeline operation cannot be obstructed due to commitment with downstream customers. In such a situation, Stopple-in is the method to isolate the valve without obstructing / shutting the flow in the pipeline. The valves were in upstream side wherein replacement of valve was done by Stopple-in and Cross plugging method. However, gas leakage was from valve body so that hot work (i.e. pipe cutting) for stopple-in was also a challenge. To arrest the leak from bolted section of valve body, sealant injection methodology was adopted Before applying this technology on high pressure live pipeline, GSPL insisted to perform the demonstration on prototype arrangement. This prototype was manufactured in the way that it has a manmade leakage point. After sealant injection in the system to arrest the leak, system was kept under high pressure of 55 Bar(g) for 24 hours. During demonstration, system sustained the pressure without any failure at leakage point. After successful demonstration, said methodology applied on leakage valve installed on high pressure line without any shutdown to arrest the leak.",,,,,ASME India International Oil and Gas Pipeline ConferenceASME India International Oil and Gas Pipeline Conference,"APR 26-27, 2019APR 26-27, 2019","ASME, Pipeline Syst Div, India ChapterASME, Pipeline Syst Div, India Chapter","New Delhi, INDIANew Delhi, INDIA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5853-0,,,,,,,,,"Gujarat State Petronet Ltd, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India",Gujarat State Petronet Ltd,,,2019-10-16,WOS:000488337200014,,

J,,,,,,,,,Alexander Alfonso Alvarez,,Development of Thrusters and underwater connectors and their applications in ROVs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jul 01 2018,2018,"Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicles (ROVs) are intended for observation and exploration of aquatic environments, such as inspection of reservoirs, submerged structures, oil and gas pipelines, support for maintenance of scientific equipment in riverbeds and oceans bed, as well as other activities in places with difficult access to humans. Equipped with cameras, they are operated by remote control by a team located on a nearby vessel and are able to send information about the vehicle as well as real-time images of the area where the ROV is located. An ROV consists basically of thrusters, connectors, several actuators, sensors, cameras, umbilical cable for communication, control electronics and its frame. The ROVs offered in the domestic market are imported. Besides the high price, subject to our import taxes, they present problems related to the high cost of maintenance, as well as the difficulty of replacing its elements. The group's experience identified three major technological bottlenecks in the development of a mid-sized inspection ROV: thrusters, umbilical cable and connectors. Reasonable quality thrusters are expensive and difficult to aquire. Cheaper thrusters have questionable performance and negative impact on umbilical and vehicle size. Another important bottleneck to be researched refers to the replacement of connectors and the umbilical cord, whose import difficulty is an important barrier to the development of ROVs and marinized equipment in general. The data transmission system must be feasible over longer distances. The main objective of the research is to develop national electrical thrusters, underwater connectors and umbilical cables to be used in inspections made ROVs. For the execution of this project, the ROV Mandí II was taken as reference. It was developed in the Laboratory of Unmanned Vehicles of the Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo by members of the company Tétis Tecnologia Aquática. The starting point to use the ROV Mandí II thrusters, which are imported, as reference since they provide satisfactory power and compactness to the vehicle. The design proposed in this project selects the main components of the thruster so as to produce slightly better thrust than that produced by the imported and equivalent sized thruster. For the development of the connectors, given the depths involved in ROV applications, lower cost manufacturing processes, ie machining and transfer molding, will be adopted. The umbilical cord, already specified, will be ordered from a national company already identified. For this, will be investigated communication improvements between ROV and surface. Specifically, the application of VDSL2 technology will be addressed, in order to increase the communication distance, which is regularly limited by 100m using the Ethernet protocol. Expected results for this project include the development of a thruster prototype, connectors and umbilical cables capable of operating at a minimum depth of 200m.The project results will enable the company not only to supply underwater thrusters, but also to technical support and ROV maintenance on national soil.

Fortunately, many of these have been found in microalgae, and biological research is following up to improve production of these materials in microalgae. Many microalgae have excellent carbon storage mechanisms for carbohydrates and/or lipids. Lipids in particular represent a wide variety of glycerolipids and carotenoids that can be converted to biofuels and nutraceutical ingredients. Their residues can also be used as feeds or processed to provide carbons for secondary production of value-added products such as fucose from other organisms.

The main trend was the strong growth of oil as a percentage of total energy consumed. Not only did oil monopolise the rapidly growing transportation market but it also penetrated rapidly into the stationary energy market. In the second half of the sixties, after the discovery of the Groningen Gas field, pipeline natural gas took a sizable share of the domestic and commercial energy market in Western Europe. This market was mainly fed by gas from Groningen, the North Sea and Russia. Another trend was the steady growth of electricity as a percentage of the stationary market partly based on nuclear energy. Coal was the loser. This rather steady development was upset by the first oil crisis in 1972. This crisis was a political crisis which had little to do with the physical availability of crude oil. Between 1972 and the present, periods of reasonable price stability were interrupted by violent swings in the price of oil and gas. Moreover, during this period the environmental movement became a major influence in the energy field. Notwithstanding the generally unstable market, some new trends developed after 1972 and some old ones continued. Will these trends continue long enough to be useful for making a scenario for the future? The forecaster Should not assume that the development of energy consumption in the USA, Western Europe and Japan will continue to be of overwhelming importance. Developments in South East Asia and Eastern Europe should be watched very carefully. There are reasons to believe that at a certain stage in economic development, transportation demand shoots up much faster than economic growth, leading to a rapid demand growth for distillate oil. Of importance is also how will the rapidly developing countries generate their increasing demand for electricity and how will they fuel their industry? There can be little doubt that in the rich countries environmental concern will be a major influence in the energy market. But in developing countries environmental concerns take second place to economic growth.

Results show that the columnar AOD (an indicator of the column abundance of aerosols) is highest at Agartala (0.80 +/- 0.24) in the west and lowest at Imphal (0.59 +/- 0.23) in the east in the pre-monsoon season due to intense anthropogenic biomass burning in this region aided by long-range transport from the high aerosol laden regions of the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), polluted Bangladesh and Bay of Bengal. In addition to local biogenic aerosols and pollutants emitted from brick kilns, oil/gas fields, household bio-fuel/fossil-fuel, vehicles, industries. Aerosol distribution and climatic impacts show a west to east gradient within the NER. For example, the climatological mean AODs are 0.67 +/- 0.26, 0.52 +/- 0.14, 0.40 +/- 0.17 and 0.41 +/- 30.23 respectively in Agartala, Shillong, Imphal and Dibrugarh which are geographically located from west to east within the NER. The average aerosol burden in NER ranks second highest with climatological mean AOD 0.49 +/- 0.2 next to the Indo-Gangetic Plains where the climatological mean AOD is 0.64 +/- 0.2 followed by the South and South-East Asia region. Elevated aerosol layers are observed over the eastern most stations Dibrugarh and Imphal, while at the western stations the concentrations are high near the surface. The climate implications of aerosols are evaluated in terms of aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) and consequent heating of the atmosphere in the region which follows AOD and exhibit high values in pre-monsoon season at all the locations except in Agartala. The highest ARF in the atmosphere occurs in the pre-monsoon season ranging from 48.6 Wm(-2) in Agartala to 25.1 Wm(-2) in Imphal. Winter radiative forcing follows that in pre-monsoon season at these locations. The heating rate is high at 1.2 K day(-1) and 1.0 K day(-1) over Shillong and Dibrugarh respectively in this season. However, Agartala experiences higher surface forcing (-56.5 Wm(-2)) and consequent larger heating of the atmosphere of 1.6 K day(-1) in winter. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Variability in BD contributes to carbon stock uncertainty, in turn affecting how large a change in stock can be observed over time or space. However, BD is difficult and time-consuming to measure, and sample collection is further complicated by extremely dry field conditions, coarse-textured soils, and high coarse-fragment content, which are common in southern Australia and other semi-arid and Mediterranean-type climates. Two alternatives to reduce BD sampling effort are to take fewer BD samples at a site (i.e. volumetric rings or clod), and to use more time-efficient methods (i.e. gamma-neutron density meter, NDM). We evaluate these options in the context of a soil carbon stock survey in agricultural land in the south-west of Australia. The BD values within a monitoring site measured with conventional and NDM methods were statistically different when assessed using large sample sizes; the measurements diverged where the coarse fraction volume was >20%. However, carbon stocks were equivalent, reflecting the much larger relative variability in carbon percentage, which contributed 84-99% of the uncertainty in carbon stocks compared with <5% from BD.

We present herein a numerical model, BIOB, to simulate the biodegradation of insoluble attached hydrocarbon. The model was used to simulate an experimental oil spill on a sand beach. The biodegradation kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting the model to the experimental data of alkanes and aromatics. It was found that parameter values are comparable to their counterparts for the biodegradation of dissolved organic matter. The biodegradation of aromatics was highly affected by the decay of aromatic biomass, probably due to its low growth rate.

The way in which the Blue Economy is conceived and understood differs significantly across different sets of actors. A particular area of contestation exists around which ocean based industries or sectors can be considered to be 'Blue'. This highlights the possibility of the Blue Economy becoming a forum through which the legitimacy of different private uses of ocean resources is contested and debated. The question of legitimacy of Blue Economy activities and sectors is explored through a critical engagement with the notion of a 'social license to operate' (SLO). Whilst SLO is normally considered in the context of individual businesses or developments, in this article we explore the applicability of SLO at a cross-sectoral scale. In doing so we examine how the concept of SLO may inform debates over appropriate private use of public ocean resources, and how this might influence the legitimacy of the broader concept of a Blue Economy. A case study involving a range of private sectors actors engaged in diverse ocean industries was conducted, drawing on interviews, a cross-sectoral survey and an interactive workshop with the ocean business community. The case study explores the role that SLO is currently playing in ocean industries. In particular we explore perceptions of who grants a SLO, what kind of concerns impact a SLO and how sectors work to obtain, or maintain, a SLO. By comparing the responses of individual sectors to these three critical questions, we identify that many of the SLO challenges currently being experienced by ocean industries relate to conflicting social and political values. This is creating a range of complex, sometimes irresolvable, SLO challenges for maritime industries, largely concentrated in sectors engaged in resource extraction, such as mining and oil and gas. In addition we find that attempts to address SLO challenges to date focus mostly on technical or technological adaptations. When comparing this to Blue Economy narratives we find that current engagement with SLO speaks primarily to interpretations of the Blue Economy which favour growth based narratives, and largely neglect competing discourses. This has considerable implications for the overall legitimacy of the Blue Economy, as the loss of SLO within one sector may undermine the credibility of the concept overall. This research highlights the importance of broader societal and political engagement in questions about appropriate use and management of private sector activities in the ocean.",,,,,,,,,59,0,1,0,11,0,66,,,0301-4207,1873-7641,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Wollongong, Australian Natl Ctr Ocean Resources & Secur ANCOR, Bldg 233,Innovat Campus, Wollongong, NSW 2522, AustraliaWageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",,,,2019-07-24,WOS:000474330600010,,

No energy means no life, and supply of energy in a cheap, plentiful, long-sustainable and environmentally safe form is a boon for everyone. In the light of rising cost of oil and fears of its exhaustion coupled with increased pollution, the governments worldwide are deliberating and making huge strides to promote renewable energy sources such as wind. Integration of wind machines with the diesel plants is pursued widely to reduce dependence on fossil-fuel-produced energy and to reduce the release of carbon gases that cause global climate change. The literature indicates that commercial/residential buildings in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) consume an estimated 10-40% of the total electric energy generated. The aim of this study is to analyse wind-speed data of Dhahran (East-Coast, KSA) to assess the economic feasibility of utilising autonomous hybrid wind-diesel power systems to meet the electrical load of 100 typical residential buildings (with annual electrical energy demand of 3512 MWh). The monthly average wind speeds range from 3.3 to 5.6 m/s. The hybrid systems simulated consist of different combinations of 600kW commercial wind machines supplemented with diesel generators. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's hybrid optimisation model for electric renewables software was employed to perform the techno-economic analysis.The simulation results indicate that for a hybrid system comprising 600kW wind capacity together with a 1.0MW diesel system (two 500kW units), the wind penetration (at 50m hub-height, with 0% annual capacity shortage) is 26%. The cost of generating energy (COE, $/kWh) from this hybrid wind-diesel system was found to be 0.070 $/kWh (assuming diesel fuel price of 0.1 $/l). The study exhibits that for a given hybrid configuration, the number of operational hours of diesel generator sets (gensets) decreases with an increase in the wind-farm capacity. Concurrently, emphasis has also been placed on wind penetration, un-met load, effect of hub-height on energy production and COE, excess electricity generation, percentage fuel savings and reduction in carbon emissions (relative to diesel-only situation) of different hybrid systems, cost breakdown of wind-diesel systems, COE of different hybrid systems, etc.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1939-7038,1939-7046,,,,,,,,,,"King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Ctr Engn Res, Res Inst, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000214528000006,,

The Gaoqiao petrochemical industry (GQPI) site showed the highest concentrations, whereas the suburban Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) displayed the lowest. The PBM in nucleation, accumulation and coarse modes were 7.63-96.7, 69.5-455, and 9.43-176 pg/m(3), respectively, and the fractions of 0.56-1.00 and 0.32-0.56 mu m were the two most abundant. Both OC and EC displayed unimodal distribution patterns (peak of 0.56-1.00 mu m) at GQPI, while bimodal distributions were observed at urban and suburban sites. Statistically positive correlations between the overall PBM and the corresponding PM and carbonaceous compounds (r = 0.38 -0.54, p < 0.01), indicating their similar origins and OC/EC enhanced gaseous mercury forming PBM. The gas particle partition model predicted gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) were 253 +/- 133, 237 +/- 122, and 257 +/- 144 pg/m(3) for GQPI, SAES and SJTU, respectively. The particle proportions of divalent mercury in the fraction of 0.32-1.00 mu m were substantial (>80%), but smaller (<50%) for nucleation and coarse modes. The fraction of 9.90-18.00 mu m occupied nearly 50% of the overall dry deposition fluxes of mercury. These finding highlight the emissions from different mercury and OC/EC origins, caused different size-specific distributions of PBM, which further affect their gas-particle partitioning and dry deposition of mercury species.

Exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbons, such as shale gas, remains controversial in the UK primarily due to concerns surrounding the hydraulic fracturing process required to extract the resource. The key issue of how waste fluids produced by hydraulic fracturing in the UK will be safely managed has yet to be adequately addressed, and the capacity for the specialist treatment required is currently uncertain. To address this critical knowledge gap we review, for the first time, the available management options for these waste fluids in the UK. We find that these are limited in comparison to the options available in the U.S., due to uncertainty surrounding whether wastewater injection wells will be permitted in the UK. Consequently, it is highly probable that these fluids will need to be treated and safely disposed of at the surface. In order to constrain the composition of wastewater which will require treatment in the UK, we analyse the only existing data set of returned waters from hydraulic fracturing (n = 31). We supplement this with measurements of wastewater from UK conventional onshore hydrocarbon (n = 3), and offshore hydrocarbon (n = 14), operations which produce water from similar formations as those currently targeted for shale gas exploration. Comparison of this limited UK data to the more extensive unconventional production dataset from the United States (n = 3092) provides confidence in our projected UK wastewater compositions. We find that the high level of salinity and concentration of naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) in UK wastewaters will be problematic to treat for disposal into a freshwater environment. We use our data compilation to estimate costs of treating such wastewaters in a number of relevant scenarios. We find that the projected salinity in FP waters from UK hydraulic fracturing operations can be treated at a cost of between $2701 (similar to 2000) pound and $1376093 (similar to 1047000) pound per well, requiring between 2 and 26% of expected revenue. Additional costs, specific to the UK of up to 163 pound 450 per well, will be incurred due to the legislative requirement for disposal of NORM concentrated sludge in permitted landfill sites. We find that existing capacity to receive NORM waste at currently permitted UK treatment facilities is limited, and that this will pose management problems if wastewaters are generated from multiple unconventional wells simultaneously.",,,,,,,,,13,3,0,0,4,0,16,,,2053-1400,2053-1419,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Grant Inst, James Hutton Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FE, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2018-02-14,WOS:000424010900019,,

Thin oil films on water were subjected to simulated sunlight, and the resulting chemical and optical changes were observed. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) showed substantial photodegradation, with larger PAHs being more rapidly decomposed. About 60% of the fluorescence at the excitation and emission maxima was observed with 12 h of simulated solar irradiation equivalent to approximately 3 d of sunlight. Synchronous scan fluorescence measurements showed 80-90% loss of larger PAHs with 12 h of simulated solar irradiation. Absorbance of the oil decreased by only 20% over the same time period. Alkanes showed no significant photochemical losses. After irradiation, the toxicity of water in contact with the oil significantly increased, presumably due to the release of water soluble photoproducts that were toxic. Photocatalyst addition resulted in enhanced degradation rate for PAHs, and toxicity of the aqueous layer was altered in the presence of photocatalysts added to the oil film. Photochemistry is an important pathway for degradation of large PAHs, which are typically resistant to biodegradation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides surfactants, this produced water also holds various organic and inorganic pollutants which requires intensive treatment before being discharged offshore. Current research focused on a radical solution for actual application in which the PVDF-TiO2 hollow fiber photocatalytic membranes were fabricated to simultaneously separate and degrade the surfactants laden in produced water. The characterization study portrayed the membranes with increasing TiO2 nanoparticles exhibited an improvement in surface hydrophilicity, porosity and tensile strength; besides, having an appropriate surface morphology and topology to remove the surfactants from produced water. Nevertheless, an excessive loading of TiO2 nanoparticles beyond 2 wt% had deteriorated the membrane performances in terms of flux and surfactant rejection measured as COD removal. These deteriorations were justified by the agglomeration of excessive TiO2 nanoparticles as observed occluding the pores on membrane surface. In predicting the membrane flux and rejection amidst the simultaneous separation and degradation of surfactants from produced water, two statistical models were subsequently derived by manipulating the produced water pH and air bubble flow rate (ABFR) of reactor operating conditions. The models permitted the fundamental comprehension of the correlations between the membrane flux and rejection parameters against the reactor operating conditions. Considering these correlations, the optimization of reactor operating conditions was finally evaluated and determined to achieve at the pH of 6.00 and ABFR of 0.41 L/min, giving rise to the membrane flux and rejection of 47.95 +/- 1.34 L/m(2)h and 66.73 +/- 0.76%, respectively.

This was a gas well drilled from a semisubmersible drilling rig. Because well testing from semisubmersible rigs is a critical and sensitive operation, all planning had been carefully reviewed by the operator to ensure a safe, environmentally friendly operation.The formation of hydrate plugs during ultradeepwater well testing is a critical concern because water can be trapped and form a solid crystalline structure around gas when there are low temperatures near the mudline. This hydrate formation is a common occurrence in deepwater drilling operations, particularly while using water-based mud. Thermodynamic inhibition may not be effective in these cases because several limitations in achieving the required injection rate exist.Oilwell testing operations in deep and ultradeep water have become common practice around the world, and vast experience with these types of operations has been acquired; experience with gas wells, however, has not been as comprehensive, and only a few gas wells have been tested under the conditions presented in this type of scenario. Because of the low number of gas wells tested in these deepwater conditions, best-practice information is limited.The intention of this paper is to present a case history and the lessons learned during a well-testing operation in which water production in the gas well was greater than anticipated during the cleanup period. A massive hydrate plug was formed while coiled tubing was being pulled out of hole, and the coiled tubing became stuck. The steps taken to free the coiled tubing will be discussed, and the discussion will include the following:Conditions that must be present to form hydratesHow the problem in this case was resolvedHow to help prevent hydrate formationBest practices for well testing in deepwater gas wells to maintain safety and economic viabilityThis case history discusses a gas well being drilled with a semisubmersible drilling rig in ultradeep water, offshore Mexico.",,,,,,,,,24,9,0,0,0,0,33,,,1930-1855,,,,,,,,,,,"PEMEX, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",,,,2011-12-21,WOS:000297240400004,,

The residues from the spill still continue to be deposited on some of these beaches. Methods to track and monitor the fate of these residues require approaches that can differentiate the DWH residues from other types of petroleum residues. This is because, historically, the crude oil released from sources such as natural seeps and anthropogenic discharges have also deposited other types of petroleum residues on GOM beaches. Therefore, identifying the origin of these residues is critical for developing effective management strategies for monitoring the long-term environmental impacts of the DWH oil spill. Advanced fingerprinting methods that are currently used for identifying the source of oil spill residues require detailed laboratory studies, which can be cost-prohibitive. Also, most agencies typically use untrained workers or volunteers to conduct shoreline monitoring surveys and these worker will not have access to advanced laboratory facilities. Furthermore, it is impractical to routinely fingerprint large volumes of samples that are collected after a major oil spill event, such as the DWH spill. In this study, we propose a simple field testing protocol that can identify DWH oil spill residues based on their unique physical characteristics. The robustness of the method is demonstrated by testing a variety of oil spill samples, and the results are verified by characterizing the samples using advanced chemical fingerprinting methods. The verification data show that the method yields results that are consistent with the results derived from advanced fingerprinting methods.

In order to meet this demand, a large number of facilities such as platforms, FPSO (floating production, storage and offloading), FSRU (floating storage and regasification unit) and LNG ships and terminals are required for the storage, processing and transportation of LNG. Failure of any of these facilities may expose the market, companies, personnel and the environment to hazards, hence making the application of risk analysis to the LNG sector a very topical issue throughout the world. To assess the risk of accidents associated with LNG facilities and carriers, various risk analysis approaches have been employed to identify the potential hazards, calculate the probability of accidents, as well as assessing the severity of consequences. Nonetheless, literature on classification of the risk analysis models applied to LNG facilities is very limited. Therefore, to reveal the holistic issues and future perspectives on risk analysis of LNG facilities, a systematic review of the current state-of-the-art research on LNG risk analysis is necessary. The aim of this paper is to review and categorize the published literature about the problems associated with risk analysis of LNG facilities, so as to improve the understanding of stakeholders (researchers, regulators, and practitioners). To achieve this aim, scholarly articles on LNG risk analysis are identified, reviewed, and then categorized according to risk assessment methods (qualitative, semi-qualitative or quantitative; deterministic or probabilistic; conventional or dynamic), tools (ETA, FTA, FMEA/FMECA, Bayesian network), output/strategy (RBI, RBM, RBIM, facility siting, etc.), data sources (OREDA handbook, published literature, UK HSE databases, regulatory agencies' reports, industry datasets, and experts' consultations), applications (LNG carriers and LNG fuelled ships, LNG terminals and stations, LNG offshore floating units, LNG plants), etc. Our study will not only be useful to researchers engaged in these areas but will also assist regulators, policy makers, and operators of LNG facilities to find the risk analysis models that fit their specific requirements.",,,,,,,,,60,6,0,0,0,0,66,,,0950-4230,1873-3352,,,,,,,,,,"Reg Maritime Univ, Fac Engn & Appl Sci, Accra, GhanaCranfield Univ, Dept Energy & Power, Cranfield, Beds, England",Reg Maritime Univ,,,2020-03-04,WOS:000514018500001,,

While some actors stress environmental acceptability and independency as pillars of energy security, others prioritized supply reliability and geopolitical benefits associated with gas exportation. Each definition of energy security was also found to be anchored in different ideologies, goals, policies and legitimizing factors.

These include loss of operating space for fishing activities in the North Sea (windfarms, nature conservation areas, Brexit) and the need for further development of sustainable fishing methods and vessels (innovations to reduce ecological and environmental impacts). Whilst the Dutch fisheries face these challenges now and in the future, it has already gone through significant changes over the past 70 years. Since the dawn of fisheries policy in Europe in the 1970s, change and development have been part of the fishing industry, indicating that transitions and change are a permanent aspect of fisheries. From past transitions lessons can be learnt to take on current and future challenges. Past transitions in Dutch fisheries were analysed from the perspective of transition and governance. Based on literature and reports produced in recent decades and pooled knowledge gained from the fishing industry, government and environmental organisations, this paper shows that the roles of the different actors involved changed during past transitions, with a shift in playing field occurring from a regional to a European scale and that joint problem definition, collective sensemaking and a long term vision are essential in navigating transition waters.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,0,10,,,0308-597X,1872-9460,,,,,,,,,,"Wageningen Marine Res, Wageningen, Netherlands",,,,2021-01-21,WOS:000598752500016,,

The mineral physics laboratory at UCSC has an extended history of training students for placement in academia and industry who have expertise in the high-pressure spectroscopy of Earth materials, and this upgrade will allow this training to continue with more user- and safety-friendly equipment. In addition to safety upgrades of the UCSC pressure-measurement system, a new Raman spectrometer will be acquired that will replace a marginally functional and obsolete 18-year old apparatus with an instrument that has higher spatial resolutions, vastly improved detection technology, and modern instrument-control and data-collection software. The issues addressed by the research enabled by this upgrade include: the water and carbon storage capacity of the deep Earth, and how exchange of water and carbon takes place between the deep Earth and the surface environment, with relevance to the formation of Earth?s oceans; the structure and physical properties of melts and fluids at high pressures, with implications for issues ranging from explosive volcanic events generated via subduction-related processes, to the possible presence of partially melted zones near Earth?s core-mantle boundary that may represent the ?roots? of deeply-derived volcanic upwellings. This apparatus will be deployed for non-high pressure materials-characterization as well, including probing fine-grained archeological samples, and fluid inclusion and paleontologic studies. In essence, it will also function as a tool for rapid and fine-scale mineral and fluid characterization that will yield insights into phenomena as diverse as the firing temperatures of ancient ceramics, the degree (and type) of fossilization produced in different geologic environments, and the compositions of ore-forming fluids trapped in mineral hosts.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,949322,,,,,,,,University of California-Santa Cruz,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13591811,,

On long voyages, the speed of a vessel can be more or less constant. Thus, to a first approximation, it can be considered that the engines operate most of the time at steady-state conditions. On this basis, Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems can be conveniently installed aboard to generate additional electric power by recovering ICEs waste heat and increase in turn the overall system efficiency. The ICEs-ORC combined cycle system has to be designed properly to maximize the work production and guarantee at the same time a stable operation during both transient and steady-state working conditions.This paper presents the design and off-design dynamic and steady-state models of three ORC system configurations that exploit the waste heat of four dual fuel diesel ICEs on board a LNG carrier. One single-stage and two (subcritical or supercritical) two-stage ORC system configurations are considered. The available heat is taken from charge air, jacket and oil cooling systems, while the exhaust gases are not considered to be available being already used for other ship internal needs. Dynamic simulations are employed to define the control strategies that lead to stable operation of all the considered ORC system configurations after transients of the ship operation. Steady-state off-design models are then used to identify the best system design point taking into account the real ship operation during a reference year. Results show that the best performing single-stage ORC is designed for a ship speed of 16.5 knots on loaded voyage, and has an annual work production of 1665.8 MW h with a peak thermal efficiency of 6.5%. The supercritical configuration reaches the best performance among the two-stage ORC systems, achieving a work production of 2306.6 MW h and a thermal efficiency of 12.6% at 15.5 knots.

A variety of satellite and surface tools currently exist to help understand snow accumulation and the loss of ice from outlet glaciers or melting, but the magnitude of water vapor exchange between the interior ice sheet and the atmosphere remains essentially unknown. This vapor flux could potentially be a very large factor in calculating the mass gain or loss of the ice sheet. Vapor flux occurs either by addition to the ice surface through vapor deposition and condensation or losses due to sublimation. This project seeks to utilize Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly referred to as drones, for collecting atmospheric water vapor samples to constrain vapor flux on the Greenland Ice Sheet. A remote-controlled sampling pod containing multiple air-capture chambers and environmental sensors will be retrofitted to a commercially available multi-copter drone and flown above the ice surface to collect samples. Upon landing, the atmospheric samples will be analyzed for water isotopes, which are variations of water molecules with different molecular weights that can, for example, provide evidence of vapor flux into or away from the ice sheet. The goal of this project is to use drone-captured data to address major gaps in the understanding of frozen water storage on the Greenland ice sheet, which could reduce uncertainty in estimates of global sea level rise. The data can also be used to improve satellite algorithms used for high-latitude measurements of water isotopes; to improve general circulation models; and improve meteorological understanding of the atmosphere in general. Further, these data may also substantiate the current understanding of long-term temperature records recovered from water isotopes of polar ice cores. Initial testing and atmospheric measurements using the drone-sampling unit will occur in Summer 2018 at an ice core camp in Northeast Greenland. A second deployment in 2019 will allow for improvements to the drone-sampling unit, and a possible deployment of a fixed wing drone aircraft, for measurement of high-resolution data across the 4-month summer field season. This project will result in the first drone retrofitted with a water vapor sampling pod, which can be directly analyzed in the field following flight. In doing so, the project stands to provide the first detailed and high-resolution airborne measurements of water vapor isotopes in the critical atmospheric boundary layer just above the Greenland Ice Sheet. This region is typically too expensive and dangerous for manned-flight missions, and balloon release experiments have proven logistically burdensome with limited scientific returns. This study brings together researchers from the fields of Aerospace Engineering and Geochemistry. Students and researchers will receive drone pilot training through a Federal Aviation Administration accredited class. Undergraduate and graduate students will receive laboratory training to assist in processing and interpreting the data. A near real-time blog for public viewing and outreach will be available during field operations, which will include field updates, selected data, photography, and film. Public lectures and scientific talks will further disseminate the knowledge learned during this project. As the technology for this project progresses, it could be transferred to other projects, such as detection of fugitive emissions from oil and gas wells or to measure methane release in regions of thawing permafrost.

The numerical flow modelling of the aquifers was undertaken to create a calibrated and validated model that could be used in the future to explore a viable remediation strategy for the aquifers. The Environmental Visualization Software (EVS-pro) 3-D data presentation program was used to construct a conceptual model as a preliminary step. A 3-D numerical model was developed using the MOD-FLOW-SURFACT code that overcame the limitations of the classical MODFLOW. This model was able to combine both freshwater lenses in one model domain simulating the vadose zone together with the saturated zone. The model domain covered an area of 580 km(2) encompassing the AlRaudhatain and Umm Al-Aish basins. A steady-state model was developed first to study regional flow patterns in the aquifer. A transient model was developed subsequently to assess seasonal recharge on groundwater and investigate their effects on flow patterns. Analysis of the calibrated steady-state model output indicated that the model simulated the groundwater elevation and flow direction across the model domain to an acceptable level.

Atmospheric measurements are consistent with a limited area of surfacing oil, with implications for leaked hydrocarbon mass transport and oil drop size distributions. The chemical data further suggest relatively little variation in leaking hydrocarbon composition over time. Although readily soluble hydrocarbons made up similar to 25% of the leaking mixture by mass, subsurface chemical data show these compounds made up similar to 69% of the deep plume mass; only similar to 31% of the deep plume mass was initially transported in the form of trapped oil droplets. Mass flows along individual transport pathways are also derived from atmospheric and subsurface chemical data. Subsurface hydrocarbon composition, dissolved oxygen, and dispersant data are used to assess release of hydrocarbons from the leaking well. We use the chemical measurements to estimate that (7.8 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) kg of hydrocarbons leaked on June 10, 2010, directly accounting for roughly three-quarters of the total leaked mass on that day.

In daytime oil absorbs light and remits this as thermal energy at temperatures 3-8 K above ambient, this is detectable by infrared (IR) cameras.Laser fluorosensors are useful instruments because of their unique capability to identify oil on backgrounds that include water, soil, weeds, ice and snow. They are the only sensor that can positively discriminate oil on most backgrounds. Radar detects oil on water by the fact that oil will dampen water-surface capillary waves under low to moderate wave/wind conditions.

Jackalope is a relatively shallow prospect (similar to 1650 m water depth) and is associated with a submarine channel-levee depositional system. Several kilometers below the seafloor, an extended sub-circular salt ridge rooted into the allochthonous salt canopy creates a system of faulted anticlinal folds. Accordingly, the distribution of bottom simulating reflections mapped at similar to 250-300 m below seafloor (mbsf) is structurally controlled, indicating that gas tends to accumulate above the hinge of the salt ridge in sand-dominated turbidites. The Jackalope system is not a single accumulation; it comprises two primary prospects (Saint Petersburg and Columbus) and several secondary prospects. The primary prospects are defined based on seismic data by peak-leading reflections and phase reversals at the base of the gas hydrate stability zone: a strong peak-leading amplitude above it changes to trough-leading amplitude below. We interpret strong peak-leading amplitudes as gas hydrate in sand-rich intervals, which is confirmed by resistivity and gamma ray logs at the margin of the Saint Petersburg prospect. Continuous gas-water contacts below the primary prospects characterize them as permeable three-component reservoirs comprising gas hydrate above gas, and gas above water. Both prospects are located at similar to 230-300 mbsf occupying a total area of similar to 5.9 km(2). Low and high estimates of in place gas at standard pressure and temperature conditions in the primary prospects range between 1.5 and 10.6 BCM. These characteristics define Jackalope as a promising, cost- and time-efficient gas hydrate system for further drilling exploration. Moreover, Jackalope demonstrates there is potential for new discoveries in the US Gulf of Mexico in particular due to expanding public 3D seismic and well log datasets.",,,,,,,,,7,3,0,0,0,0,10,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USAUniv Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,,2019-12-12,WOS:000498747300018,,

Much of this land is used for a broad range of agricultural purposes and the need for coexistence between the farm and gas industries has been the source of much conflict. Whilst much research has been undertaken into the environmental and economic impacts of CSG, little research has looked into the issues of coexistence between farmers and the CSG industry in the shared space that is a farm business, a home and a resource extraction network. We conducted three workshops with farmers from across a broad region undergoing CSG development to explore farmers' perceptions of some of the issues arising from large scale land use change. Workshops explored the importance of place identity and landscape aesthetics for farmers, farmers' acceptance and coping with change, and possible benefits from off-farm income. We found that farmers believed that place identity was not well understood by CSG staff from non-rural backgrounds and that farmers struggled to explain some concerns because of the different way they interpreted their landscape. Furthermore, high staff turnover, and the extensive use of contractors also impacted on communications. These factors were the cause of much frustration and farmers felt that this has led to severe impacts on mental health and wellbeing. Farmers felt that a change in culture within the CSG companies will be required if engagement with farmers is to improve and that efforts to employ local people in these communications was helping this. The workshops also identified a range of issues perceived by farmers arising from increased traffic volumes, impacts to mental health and wellbeing, place identity and loss of water resources for farmers. Finally, it was suggested that scientists and agricultural industry groups will need to work closely with farmers to develop understanding of these emerging issues and to develop solutions that are timely and relevant.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,0,11,,,0889-048X,1572-8366,,,,,,,,,,"CSIRO, 203 Tor St, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, AustraliaDalgliesh Agr, 11 Rangeview Rd, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, AustraliaCSIRO, 306 Carmody Rd, St Lucia, Qld 4067, AustraliaCSIRO, Boggo Rd, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia",Dalgliesh Agr,,,2018-03-06,WOS:000425539300006,,

The modifications of the BFT in this study included use of one oil rather than two, increasing replication from 4 runs to 6, and testing at two temperatures, 5 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Results indicated that temperature was not as critical a variable as the literature suggested, likely because of the low viscosity and light weight of the SLC.

The main effect from droplet oil is input of additional dissolved hydrocarbons to the exposure system following preparation of the initial stock solution. Toxicity was characterized using toxic units (TU) and shows that replenishment of bioavailable hydrocarbons by droplets in toxicity tests with low droplet content (e.g., <1 mg/L) is negligible, consistent with typical exposure conditions following open ocean oil spills. Further, the use of volumetric exposure metrics (e.g., mg/L) introduces considerable variability and the bioavailability-based metrics (e.g., TUs) provide a more consistent basis for understanding oil toxicity data.

Characteristic hopane and sterane fingerprints show that all the tar ball samples originated from DH oil. In addition, the diagnostic ratios of various hopanes indicate an excellent match. Quantitation data for C-30 alpha beta-hopane concentration levels show that most of the weathering observed in DH-related tar balls found on Alabama's beaches is likely the result of natural evaporation and dissolution that occurred during transport across the Gulf of Mexico prior to beach deposition. Based on the physical and biomarker characterization data presented in this study we conclude that virtually all fragile, sticky, brownish tar balls currently found on Alabama shoreline originated from the DH oil spill.

This metabolic function is a source of biogenic methane in coastal natural gas aquifers, submarine mud volcanoes, and methane hydrates. Within the methanogenic communities, hydrogenotrophic methanogens, and syntrophic bacteria are converting volatile fatty acids to methane syntrophically via interspecies hydrogen transfer. Recently, direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) between fermentative/syntrophic bacteria and electrotrophic methanogens has been proposed as an effective interspecies metabolite transfer process to enhance methane production. In this study, in order to stimulate the DIET-associated methanogenic process at deep biosphere-aquifer systems in a natural gas field, we operated a bioelectrochemical system (BES) to apply voltage between an anode and a cathode. Two single-chamber BESs were filled with seawater-based formation water collected from an onshore natural gas well, repeatedly amended with acetate, and operated with 600 mV between electrodes for 21 months, resulting in a successful conversion of acetate to methane via electrical current consumption. One reactor yielded a stable current of ~200 mA/m2 with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 90%; however, the other reactor, which had been incidentally disconnected for 3 days, showed less electromethanogenic activity with a CE of only ~10%. The 16S rRNA gene-based community analyses showed that two methanogenic archaeal families, Methanocalculaceae and Methanobacteriaceae, were abundant in cathode biofilms that were mainly covered by single-cell-layered biofilm, implicating them as key players in the electromethanogenesis. In contrast, family Methanosaetaceae was abundant at both electrodes and the electrolyte suspension only in the reactor with less electromethanogenesis, suggesting this family was not involved in electromethanogenesis and became abundant only after the no-electron-flow event. The anodes were covered by thick biofilms with filamentous networks, with the family Desulfuromonadaceae dominating in the early stage of the operation. The family Geobacteraceae (mainly genus Geoalkalibacter) became dominant during the longer-term operation, suggesting that these families were correlated with electrode-respiring reactions. These results indicate that the BES reactors with voltage application effectively activated a subsurface DIET-related methanogenic microbiome in the natural gas field, and specific electrogenic bacteria and electromethanogenic archaea were identified within the anode and/or cathode biofilms.

Gas engines in gen-sets and cogeneration plants can be found in industrial sites, oil and gas field application, hospitals, public communities, etc., mainly in the U.S., Japan, and Europe, and with an increasing potential in the upcoming areas in the far east. Gas engines are chosen sometimes even to replace diesel engines, because of their clean exhaust emission characteristics and the ample availability of natural gas in the world. The Austrian Jenbacher Energie Systeme AG has been producing gas engines in the range of 300 to 1600 kW since 1960. The product program covers state-of-the-art natural gas engines as well as advanced applications for a wide range of alternative gas fuels with emission levels comparable to Low Emission (LEV) and Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) standards. In recent times the demand for special cogeneration applications is rising. For example, a turnkey cogeneration power plant for a total 14.4 MW electric power and heat output consisting of four JMS616-GSNLC/B spark-fired gas engines specially tuned for high altitude operation has been delivered to the well-known European ski resort of Sestriere. Sestriere is situated in the Italian Alps at an altitude of more than 2000 m (approx. 6700 ft) above sea level. The engines feature a turbocharging system tuned to an ambient air pressure of only 80 kPa to provide an output and efficiency of each 1.6 MW and up to 40 percent @ 1500 rpm, respectively. The ever-increasing demand for lower pollutant emissions in the U.S. and some European countries initiates developments in new exhaust aftertreatment technologies. Thermal reactor and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems are used to reduce tailpipe CO and NO, emissions of engines. Both SCR and thermal reactor technology will shift the engine tuning to achieve maximum efficiency and power output. Development results are presented, featuring the ultra low emission potential of biogas and natural gas engines with exhaust aftertreatment.",,,,,16th Annual Fall Technical Conference of the ASME Internal-Combustion-Engine-Division16th Annual Fall Technical Conference of the ASME Internal-Combustion-Engine-Division,"OCT 02-06, 1994OCT 02-06, 1994","ASME, Internal Combust Engine DivASME, Internal Combust Engine Div","LAFAYETTE, INLAFAYETTE, IN",4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,0742-4795,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1995-10-01,WOS:A1995TT88100024,,

Despite this, assessments of urban vegetation carbon stocks often fail to identify important landscape-scale drivers of variation in urban carbon, especially the potential effects of landscape structure variables at different spatial scales. We combined field measurements with Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data to build high-resolution models of woody plant aboveground carbon across the urban portion of Brisbane, Australia, and then identified landscape scale drivers of these carbon stocks. First, we used LiDAR data to quantify the extent and vertical structure of vegetation across the city at high resolution (5 x 5m). Next, we paired this data with aboveground carbon measurements at 219 sites to create boosted regression tree models and map aboveground carbon across the city. We then used these maps to determine how spatial variation in land cover/land use and landscape structure affects these carbon stocks. Foliage densities above 5 m height, tree canopy height, and the presence of ground openings had the strongest relationships with aboveground carbon. Using these fine-scale relationships, we estimate that 2.2 +/- 0.4 TgC are stored aboveground in the urban portion of Brisbane, with mean densities of 32.6 +/- 5.8 MgCha(-1) calculated across the entire urban land area, and 110.9 +/- 19.7 Mg C ha(-1) calculated within treed areas. Predicted carbon densities within treed areas showed strong positive relationships with the proportion of surrounding tree cover and how clumped that tree cover was at both 1 km(2) and 1 ha resolutions. Our models predict that even dense urban areas with low tree cover can have high carbon densities at fine scales. We conclude that actions and policies aimed at increasing urban carbon should focus on those areas where urban tree cover is most fragmented. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Oil spill fingerprinting from GC-FID and GC-MS coupled with chemometric techniques (discriminant analysis and principal component analysis) is used as a diagnostic tool to classify the types of oil polluting the water. Clustering and discrimination of oil spill compounds in the water from the actual site of oil spill events are divided into four groups viz. diesel, Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), Mixture Oil containing Light Fuel Oil (MOLFO) and Waste Oil (WO) according to the similarity of their intrinsic chemical properties. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that diesel, HFO, MOLFO and WO are types of oil or oil products from complex oil mixtures with a total variance of 85.34% and are identified with various anthropogenic activities related to either intentional releasing of oil or accidental discharge of oil into the environment. Our results show that the use of chemometric techniques is significant in providing independent validation for classifying the types of spilled oil in the investigation of oil spill pollution in Malaysia.

Marine and industrial oil spills are commonplace in the area, causing the waterways and adjacent marshes to become polluted with a range of petroleum-related contaminants. Using Rock-Eval pyrolysis, the hydrocarbon impact on a saltmarsh was assessed at regular intervals down to 90 cm, with several key sampling depths of interest identified for further analysis. Ultrahigh resolution data are obtained by direct infusion (DI) atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) on a 12 T solariX Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FTICR MS) allowing trends in the compositional profile with depth to be observed, such as changes in the relative hydrocarbon intensity and the relative contributions from oxygen- and sulfur-containing groups. These trends may correlate with the timing of major oil spills and leaks of petroleum and other industrial chemicals into the water-ways. The use of gas chromatography (GC) coupled to a 7 T solariX 2XR FTICR MS equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) ion source offers retention time resolved and extensive compositional information for the complex environmental samples complementary to that obtained by DI-APPI. The compositional profile observed using GC-APCI FTICR MS includes contributions from phosphorous-containing groups, which may be indicative of contamination from other anthropogenic sources.

The failure of the 15(th) United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP15) to obtain a legally binding emissions reduction agreement makes the deployment of geo-engineering solutions an increasingly attractive proposition. This review looks at a variety of global and local approaches to geo-engineering covering solar radiation management and carbon cycle engineering and attempts to assess the feasibility of the technologies from an engineering perspective. However, despite the plethora of ideas generated by the science community, it still appears that much work remains to be done in the initial engineering assessment of these techniques and this is a major hurdle to overcome before any geo-engineering scheme can be fully considered.

To this end, there have been major reductions in anthropogenic gaseous emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). SO2 and NOx are also major contributors to particulate haze, which affects visibility in both urban and rural environments. The Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network has tracked trends in haze in remote regions of the United States since the late 1980s by reconstructing total light extinction (b(ext)) from speciated particulate concentrations. Regional trends in b(ext) were examined using aggregated data from individual sites. Regional, annual mean short-term trends analyses (2002-2018) indicated strong reductions in b(ext) associated with reduced SO2 and NOx emissions, especially in the eastern United States (-4.3% yr(-1), p < 0.001) where haze historically was dominated by sulfate particles. Less improvement occurred in the Intermountain West/Southwest (-0.9% yr(-1), p = 0.03) and trends were negative but insignificant along the West Coast (-1.5% yr(-1), p = 0.19). On average, across the continental remote United States, b(ext) has decreased at a rate of -2.8% yr(-1) (p < 0.001) from 2002 through 2018 and -1.8% yr(-1) (p < 0.001) from 1992 through 2018. The composition of haze has shifted away from being sulfate-dominated to having higher contributions from carbonaceous and crustal aerosols. This shift points to the success of combined regulatory activities aimed at reducing anthropogenic emissions over the last three decades. As emissions from regulated sources of SO2 and NOx continue to decline, the contributions to haze from unregulated sources, both anthropogenic and natural, such as oil and gas extraction, international sources, biomass burning, and dust, have increased in importance. Reducing haze from these sources would require additional mitigation strategies and resource management plans.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,7,0,20,,,1352-2310,1873-2844,,,,,,,,,,"Colorado State Univ, Cooperat Inst Res Atmosphere, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USANatl Pk Serv, Air Resources Div, Lakewood, CO 80235 USA",,,,2020-11-23,WOS:000587335700017,,

Oceans today, are playing an eminent part in monitoring climate, storing and releasing Carbon dioxide, supplying foodstuffs, and shipping. The sectors that can benefit most from this research are industries dealing with oil and gas, fisheries, UW instrumentation, armed forces, research and exploration bureaus, etc. Existing terrestrial Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol which mostly use radio waves for communications are unsuitable for underwater atmosphere. Underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) using acoustic wireless networking finds application in the supporting tools for such applications. The unique properties of the UW acoustic communication path necessitate the need for new efficient, reliable MAC protocols to meet the challenges of propagation delay, multipath and fading and excessive power absorption at higher frequencies etc. Owing to the typical properties of acoustic wave propagation in the underwater atmosphere, the energy efficiency in UW-ASN is badly affected by the long propagation delay and data packet collisions, which hinders the transmission of the data packets that enables us to achieve collective monitoring tasks. This paper, present MAC protocols tailored for UWANs, the classification of MAC protocols, the state of the art, environment characteristics, challenges, and performance metrics in terms of throughput, propagation delay, energy consumption and quantitative analysis of some selected protocols. It also gives an insight of some challenges and open issues for future works.

This lack of understanding hinders the remediation industry's ability to effectively engage with these residents about remediation technology selection, at a time when such engagement is become part and parcel of remediation policy and practice. The study develops on wider research into public acceptance of technologies, using data from a telephone survey of 2009 residents living near thirteen contaminated sites across Australia. Within the survey acceptance is measured through residents' level of support for the application of remedial ion technologies in their local area. Firstly, a regression analysis of closed-ended questions, and coding of open-ended questions are combined to identify the main predictors of residents' support for remediation technologies. Secondly, coding of open-ended questions was analysed using Crawford and Ostrom's Institutional Grammar Tool to identify norms and sanctions guiding residents' willingness to negotiate their support. The research identifies factors associated with the residents' personal and demographic characteristics, their physical context and engagement with institution during remediation processes, and the technologies themselves which predict residents level of support for the application of remediation technologies. Bioremediation technologies had higher levels of support than chemical, thermal and physical technologies. Furthermore, the paper identifies a core set of norms and sanctions residents use to negotiate their level of support for remediation technologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A second, winter survey in Southern California measured CH4 at 2 Hz with a cavity ring-down spectrometer in 2012.Data revealed strong and persistent FFI CH4 sources associated with refining, oil/gas production, a presumed major pipeline leak, and a coal loading plant. Nocturnal CH4 mixing ratios tended to be higher than daytime values for similar sources, sometimes significantly, which was attributed to day/night meteorological differences, primarily changes in the boundary layer height. The highest CH4 mixing ratio (39 ppm) was observed near the Kern River Oil Field, California, which uses steam reinjection. FFI CH4 plume signatures were distinguished as stronger than other sources on local scales. On large (4 degrees) scales, the CH4 trend was better matched spatially with FFI activity than wetland spatial patterns.Qualitative comparison of surface data with SCIAMACHY and GOSAT satellite retrievals showed agreement of the large-scale CH4 spatial patterns. Comparison with inventory models and seasonal winds suggests for some seasons and some portions of the Gulf of Mexico a non-negligible underestimation of FFI emissions. For other seasons and locations, qualitative interpretation is not feasible. Unambiguous quantitative source attribution is more complex, requiring transport modeling. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Nominal exposure concentrations for acute experiments were 0, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1,200 mg/L for WAFs, and 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/L for CEWAFs. Calculated total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (TPAH) values were 0, 22.5, 45, 90, 181, and 271 mu g/L for WAFs, and 0, 4.5, 8.9, 17.8, 35.7, 71, and 142 mu g/L for CEWAFs. The exposure concentration for sublethal experiments was 16 mg/L CEWAF. Total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations represent moderate to high levels of TPAH reported during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) event.

Exposure to CEWAFs, in general, resulted in increased toxicity over WAFs, likely as a result of the increased bioavailability of hydrocarbons. In contrast to acute exposures, short-term (24-h) sublethal exposure of D-stage larvae to CEWAFs (16 mg/L) had no impact on survival or growth.

The so-called ?HoustonNet? will support studies of urban natural hazards related to deformation processes associated with local and regional tectonics, flood loading and subsurface fluid extraction and salt diapirism, in large part causing subsidence and sinkhole dynamics in this area with significant associated civil costs and engineering and hazards management considerations. Data from the network will also enable geoscientists to address fundamental questions about the relationship between tectonic motions in the Gulf Coast and the activity and processes of growth of normal faults, the role of salt domes, and the possible role of aquifer depletion and petroleum extraction in re-activating certain normal faults. HoustonNet will span an area of 200 x 150 km with average GPS station spacing of 15 km inside the Houston metro area and 30 km outside the metro area. Forty-five (45) continuously operating GPS stations, 10 with co-located weather stations would be installed. Twenty-five (25) of these will be maintained by the Houston-Galveston Subsidence District and Fort Bend Subsidence District for ground subsidence monitoring motivated by understanding the effects of water, oil, and gas extraction. Seven (7) stations will be co-located with borehole extensometers operated by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Five (5) stations will be in close proximity with weather and environmental towers operated by the University of Houston (UH). Eight (8) stations will be installed on local public school buildings. The stations will be installed with assistance of a UNAVCO field engineer and a graduate student who will be trained in geodetic monument engineering and GPS geodesy. All of the observational data will be telemetered and open to the public through the data archiving facility at UNAVCO and a real-time GPS data streaming system at the UH Geodesy Laboratory. The network will also support real time tropospheric water vapor tomography in support of atmospheric studies and for improving regional weather forecasting and hurricane intensity forecasting. The network will serve the local civil engineering for cadastral surveys and engineering projects requiring precise positioning. The PI team includes faculty from the Departments of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Civil & Environmental Engineering, Engineering Technology, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) at the University of Houston and planned installations at local area K-12 building will form the basis of planned outreach efforts. ***",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1229278,,,,,,,,University of Houston,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13749753,,

However, lack of detailed aridification records hinders elucidation of how drying is controlled by these factors and to what extent each factor contributes. In this study, a 600 m deep core (SG-3) of lacustrine-playa deposits was obtained from the western Qaidam Basin, NE Tibetan Plateau for pollen analysis. Magnetostratigraphic dating of the core determines its age at ca. 3.1-0.01 Ma. The palynologic compositions show that a steppe to desert vegetation predominates the core. Artemisia-dominated steppe representative of relative warm and wet climate before 2.6 Ma changed to Chenopodiaceae-dominated steppe desert under drier climate conditions between 2.6 Ma and 0.9 Ma, interrupted by a short moister interval of Artemisia-dominated steppe at 1.8-1.2 Ma. From 0.9 Ma to 0.6 Ma, Chenopodiaceae-Ephedraceae desert vegetation started to develop, and since 0.6 Ma, Ephedraceae-dominated desert prevailed. This vegetation change in the western Qaidam Basin suggests a stepwise long-term aridification of the central Asia inland beginning at ca. 2.6 Ma, 1.2 Ma, 0.9 Ma and 0.6 Ma since the late Pliocene, most probably as a response to both long-term global cooling and Tibetan Plateau uplift at those times.

J,,,,,,,,,"Thomas, Andrew",,Remote Sensing of the NE Pacific: Retrospective and Concurrent Time Series Analysis Using Multiple Sensors on Multiple Scales,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Aug 01 1997,1997,"PROJECT SUMMARY: A significant number of physical and biological variables covary within and between the boundary currents of the subarctic and subtropical gyres in the NE Pacific Ocean. These (summarized in US GLOBEC Reports 17, 11 and 7) include the strength of the transports, surface temperatures, zooplankton biomass and the catch of commercially important fishes. Time scales range from individual events to interdecadal regime shifts. The mechanisms by which these physical and biological fields covary are unknown, but it is postulated that the same mechanisms involved in interannual variability also affect long term climatic variability. Clarification and quantification of the mechanisms governing interannual variability will therefore help to `model` the biological and physical responses of these economically and ecologically important systems to future climate change. One of the principal strategies for addressing variability across these time and space scales and their potential linkages is to make effective use of historical and presently available multi sensor satellite data sets. The goal of this proposal is to process, archive and analyze environmental data from a number of satellite sensors and other sources in order to characterize and quantify the dominant modes of variability in surface transports, temperature and pigment concentrations in the NE Pacific Ocean. The analyses will cover multiple time/space scales, considering basin scale connections, mesoscale circulation within specific regions of the boundary currents, and small scale, nearshore circulation in two of the regions. In addition to the analysis carried out in this project, these data will be made available over Internet and on CDROM to other investigators. On the basin scale, the project will quantify the exchange between the West Wind Drift (WWD), the Coastal Gulf of Alaska (CGOA) and the California Current System (CCS), testing the often used hypothesis that the covariability in the two boundary currents is due to changes in the location of the WOOD. The alternate large scale hypothesis is that this is not the case that these boundary currents are forced by the large scale wind systems and that these atmospheric systems covary between the basins. Satellite altimeters and scatterometers provide the instruments to test this hypothesis for the first time. Consistently reanalyzed atmospheric model winds allow a test of the wind covariability over a longer period than possible with the satellite data. The largescale modes of transport variability will be quantified using EOF analysis and Canonical Correlat on Analysis. On the mesoscale, within each boundary current, the combination of AVHRR SST and/or satellite ocean color with altimeter data can resolve mesoscale circulation features with scales of 50 100 km or less. AVHRR and ocean color data, with 1 km resolution, will be collected and processed in ongoing fashion for the three years of the project (1998 2000). Historical 1 km AVERR data over the CCS (25Ý 55ÝN) for the period 1981 1997 will also be processed in identical fashion. These data, will allow an examination of the mesoscale circulation (location and seasonality of jets and eddies) around the sites proposed for process studies in Phase II of the US GLOBEC/CoOP study. The direct transport along the boundaries of British Columbia and the Northwest US will also be examined, to provide greater details about the large scale connection between the gyres. Other areas of focus will be: the region around the Columbia River Plume, due to the impact on out migrating Coho salmon; the region west of Prince William Sound, where juvenile salmon encounter the Alaskan Stream; and details of the flow from the coastal ocean along central and southern Oregon into the core of the California Current oflf northern and central California. The analysis will test the hypothesis that much of the interannual variability seen off central California in the CalCOl?I data set comes from the upwelling region off Oregon, rather than from the WOOD. Combination of the satellite data with in situ data collected during monitoring studies (funded by GLOBEC or other sources) will be used to transform the satellite circulation fields into mass, heat and pigment surface transports. Timing of seasoual transitions will be another focus, due to possible mismatches of coastal ocean environmental couditions with salmon out migrations.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,9711919,,,,,,,,University of Maine,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13765765,,

The probability of dermal exposure and of peak exposure was also assessed. Before risk was examined, an exposure estimate comparison and rationalisation exercise was performed across the studies to ensure accuracy and consistency of approach. This article evaluates the final exposure estimates and their use in the risk assessments.Overall benzene exposure estimates were low: 90% of participants accumulated less than 20 ppm-years. Mean cumulative exposure was estimated as 5.15 ppm-years, mean duration was 22 years, and mean exposure intensity was 0.2 ppm. 46% of participants were allocated a peak exposure (>3 ppm at least weekly). 40% of participants had a high probability of dermal exposure ( based on the relative probability of at least weekly exposure).There were differences in mean intensity of exposure, probability of peak, and/or dermal exposure associated with job category, job site, and decade of exposure. Terminal Operators handling benzene-containing products were the most highly exposed group, followed by Tanker Drivers carrying gasoline. Exposures were higher around 1940-1950 and lower in more recent decades. Overall confidence in the exposure estimates was highest for recently held jobs and for white-collar jobs. We used sensitivity analyses, which included and excluded case-sets on the basis of exposure certainty scores, to inform the risk assessment.The above analyses demonstrated that the different patterns of exposure across the three studies are largely attributable to differences in jobs, site types, and time frames rather than study.

The relevance of scientific research and development in the field of protection of the oil industry pipelines is confirmed by the Energy Strategy of Russia for the period until 2030 approved by the decree of the Government of the Russian Federation on November 13, 2009. According to this program, one of the main tasks that must be solved to achieve the strategic goals of development of the oil complex are: - development of transport infrastructure, including pipeline infrastructure, to increase efficiency, diversify the structure and directions of transportation of oil and oil products (in this area, the main projects are: completion of the construction of the Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline, construction of the Unecha-Ust-Luga oil pipeline (the second line of the Baltic pipeline system), the development of export oil and oil products terminals in the ports of Primorsk, Ust-Luga, Nakhodka, the development of the oil product pipelines of the country; - resource and energy saving, reduction of losses at all stages of the technological process in the preparation of reserves, extraction, transportation and refining of oil. Energy saving in the oil complex will be carried out in the following main areas: in oil production - reduction of oil consumption for technological needs and losses, enhanced oil recovery, optimization of well operation, etc.; in the transportation of oil - the reconstruction of oil pipelines and the system organization of their operating modes of operation, reducing oil losses, improving the technical condition of oil pumping units, etc .; in the processing of oil - increasing the depth of processing, more complete use of refinery gases, etc. The main development of the complex as a whole will be focused on the development of oil refining and petrochemical industry in order to increase production and sales of petroleum products with high added value. From the foregoing, it can be concluded that the demand for the use of steel pipes used in all spheres of the petroleum industry will increase, and therefore in their anticorrosive and thermal insulation protection with an internal silicate enamel coating and an outer lining made from a modern and durable insulation foam glass. Within the framework of this Strategy, a set of studies and works carried out within the framework of the project is relevant for solving the problems of introducing energy-saving technologies and materials, upgrading the exhausted energy installations and energy transportation systems. To replace obsolete and lay new underground pipelines with an extended life, the project will develop a resource-saving technology for integrated protection of the outer and inner surfaces of the pipe. Protection of the internal surface will be achieved through the use of anticorrosive silicate enamel coatings with increased chemical, thermal, corrosion and abrasion resistance in the temperature range of operation from -50 to +350 ° C, which do not allow deposits on the walls of pipes to protect the pipelines from internal corrosion at transportation of aggressive products, as well as reducing hydraulic resistance and increasing the throughput of pipelines. Protection of the external surface of the pipeline will be achieved through the use of heat-insulating foam glass facing with increased chemical and atmospheric resistance in severe climatic conditions of operation in the temperature range from -50 to +350 ° C, which prevents cooling and increasing the viscosity of transported petroleum products, as well as providing pipeline protection from external corrosion under the influence of environmental factors for 100 years or more. The project will carry out theoretical studies of the potential base of silicate-containing amorphous natural and technogenic raw materials of the Far East of Russia and Northern China, the influence of the properties of raw materials and modes of synthesis of the materials being developed, the processes of their interaction with transported products, and recommendations for the integrated protection of pipelines are formulated. The scientific novelty of the project is to develop the technological foundations for the energy-efficient comprehensive protection of oil pipelines operating in the harsh climatic conditions of the Far East of Russia, based on the application of anticorrosive silicate-enamel coatings and foam insulation insulating materials developed on the basis of local raw materials.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,18-19-00455,,,,,,,,Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education M.I.Platov South-Russian State Polytechnic University (NPI),Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education M.I.Platov South-Russian State Polytechnic University (NPI),,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15294831,,

This study aims to investigate the effective factors on the biodegradation of Iranian heavy crude oil by Bacillus licheniformis. For this purpose, oil removal from the artificial seawater was studied by response surface methodology (RSM). After the screening experiments, pH (4-10), Had. concentration (0-10 g/L), and oil concentration (500-4500 ppm) were selected as influential factors. Moreover, to evaluate the bacterial capability in bioremediation of an actual polluted site, crude oil spill with a salinity of 35 g/L was experimentally simulated. The proposed model in this study clearly shows that both selected individual factors and their interactions are significantly effective on the crude oil biodegradation capacity. The results showed that Bacillus licheniformis was able to degrade crude oil at different concentrations of oil, especially at low concentrations, which are challenging in actual polluted sites. 15%-66% removal was achieved for 500-4500 ppm of crude oil after 14 days. Furthermore, according to the obtained results, this bacterium can tolerate the salinity up to 3.5%. At this salinity level, crude oil removal was 23.43 and 25.64% in neutral and alkaline conditions, respectively. Process factors were optimized, and 54.8% of crude oil was removed at optimum conditions i.e., 3500 ppm crude oil concentration, 2.5 g/L of NaCl and pH equal to 8.5.

Developments in transportation technology, such as vehicle electrification, can result in significant CO2, particulate matter, and SOx reductions over the lifetime of a vehicle. The shipping industry alone accounted for 2.1% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2012, however, due to energy requirements and weight restrictions, batteries and direct electrification cannot be used to mitigate emissions. Synthetic fuels, as an indirect electrification option, are a viable solution to achieve emission reduction goals. The purpose of this study is to determine the most cost effective combination of synthetic fuels and fuel cells or internal combustion engines to replace fossil oil as the main propulsion fuel in the shipping industry in 2030 and 2040. The fuels, namely RE-FT-Diesel, RE-LNG, RE-LH2 and RE-MeOH, are analysed for both an internal combustion engine and a fuel cell. The scenarios were analysed by comparing the levelised cost of mobility (LCOM). The LCOM was composed of 5 different facets including the capex of the engines/fuel cells and the tanks, the opex of the engines/fuel cells, the cost of lost cargo space, fuel cost and the CO2 cost. The final unit of comparison was epsilon/1000DWT-km. It was determined that hydrogen fuel cells were the most likely to replace fossil internal combustion engines if the fuel cells follow their expected development. Significant gains in fuel cell average efficiency and decreases in production cost between today and 2030 and 2040 are factors contributing to the competitiveness. A CO2 cost was set to 61 E/tCO(2) in 2030 and 75 epsilon/CO2 in 2040. Most of the other technology combinations are close to competing with fossil diesel with a CO2 price in 2040; however, hydrogen fuel cells are close to competing with fossil fuel without a CO2 cost in 2040.",,,,,,,,,89,0,0,0,2,0,90,,,0196-8904,1879-2227,,,,,,,,,,"Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Skinnarilankatu 34, Lappeenranta 53850, Finland",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000430882100021,,

The intensity of the reactions, however, depends on the abundance of susceptible minerals (e.g. carbonates, clays) in the pore space of the host rock. Such interactions may impact on the multiphase flow characteristics of the underground fluids-rock system over short as well as long time frames.In this research the in-situ multiphase flow characteristics of four sandstone samples have been investigated using a set of laboratory measurements. The samples tested were taken from the Wonnerup Member of the Triassic Lesueur Sandstone which is under consideration as a storage formation in the South-West Hub CO2 geo-sequestration site in Western Australia.All the samples tested show favourable characteristics in terms of storage capacity in the form of residual capillary trapping with residual CO2 saturation varying between 23% and 43%. They underwent a degree of alteration to their petrophysical characteristics which was most significantly pronounced in the case of their absolute gas permeability which showed drops of 25%-60% in the post-flood samples. Formation damage by fines migration is proposed as a mechanism for the observed reduction in permeability. The fines are believed to have originated from the kaolinite particles present in the pore space of the samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The buoy network was developed for the Texas General Lands Office (TGLO) in support of off spill modeling, mitigation and response in the Gulf of Mexico. The government of Texas, and in particular the TGLO have supported the TABS program since its inception in 1995 at seven locations in the Gulf of Mexico. The program currently has nine locations with the two additional sites receiving support through a joint industry project supported by a consortium of oil companies operating in the Flower Garden Banks region of the gulf. The initial buoy systems were developed by the Geochemical and Environmental Research Group (GERG) of Texas A&M University (TAMU) with the Woods Hole Group (WHG) of Falmouth, MA to measure and report near real time surface currents through cellular and satellite telemetry. Since the initial development in 1995, the buoy systems have evolved to include additional sensors such as ADCP's, CTD's, optical sensors, meteorological sensors, GPS, various means of telemetry and most recently, seafloor mounted sensors.In early 2003, GERG began to explore the means by which the TABS network could accommodate additional sensors to expand and enhance the data capability and data value to the end users, increase reliability, provide a faster turn around time during routine servicing and provide modularity in terms of both hardware and software. Because the TABS buoys are a spar design with limited power and space, choice of the right controller was critical.The TABS controller hardware was upgraded from a Motorola 68332 processor based system, to a more powerful PC104 computer system operating at 100 MHz, with 12 serial ports, 16 analog ports, 24 digital I/O's, 2 USB ports and fast Ethernet. The computer and peripherals operate at approximately 3 wafts on a 12 volt supply making it suitable for long term deployments with a solar charging system. The CPU runs on a Linux operating system with high level software written Pert and modular sensor support written in C. The new buoys offer much greater flexibility in terms of the type and quantity of sensors the buoy can support, overall processing speed and capability, internal diagnostic capability, as well as the ability to safely handle remote software upgrades without danger of catastrophic failure if the upgrade is corrupted through telemetry. In February 2005 the first of the new generation buoys was deployed off of San Louis Pass located south west of Galveston, Texas. During this deployment new systems and sensors were tested including the ability of a TABS buoy to acoustically collect processed wave data from a bottom mounted wave gauge ADCP.

Oil residues collected 90 days to 120 days after the spill showed a weathering pattern where significant amounts of light to middle molecular weight normal alkanes were depleted with pristane and phytane as dominant peaks. Diagnostic ratios developed from n-alkane and selected isoprenoids (e.g. Pr/Ph, n-C-17/Pr, n-C-18/Ph, carbon preference index, LMW/HMW-alkanes ratio), all display obvious changes over weathering time, indicating that these ratios are not valid for oil source identification. Furthermore, the biomarker ratios of hopanes and steranes with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 0.88-4.08% were useful for source identification even for severely weathered oil residues. In addition, RSD of delta C-13 values of individual n-alkanes in oil residue varied from 0.07% to 0.20%, which suggest that stable carbon isotope profile of n-alkanes can also be a useful tool for tracing the source of an oil spill.

This technique is focused on identifying low saline aquifer zone, which is connected to the river bed for establishing RBF well on Varaha river bank. Using Geophysical methods (Electrical Resistivity Tomography, Vertical Electrical Soundings) and hydrochemistry surveys, the river-aquifer interaction zones (low saline) are successfully identified and drilled the RBF well on the Varaha river bank up to the depth of 35 m below ground level.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop efficient strategies to remove oil and organic pollutants from water surfaces. The aim of this study is to develop a high performance magnetic, superhydrophobic/superoleophilic three-dimensional porous composite material for efficient and selective adsorption of organic pollutants from water. The composite material was fabricated by simple immersion of a commercially available polyurethane (PU) sponge into a solution of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) containing pre-synthesized magnetic (Fe3O4) nanoparticles. The composite material exhibited a water contact of similar to 155 degrees and an oil contact angle of similar to 0 degrees. The presence of the Fe3O4 particles allowed magnetic-controlled elimination of underwater oil, while the superhydrophobic character of the functionalized PU sponge permitted efficient separation of oil/water mixtures and demulsification of toluene/water emulsions. Moreover, the HDPE coating not only firmly immobilized the magnetic particles, but also contributed to the excellent stability of the composite sponge which withstood acid, base, salts, seawater or temperature variation from - 20 degrees C to 105 degrees C. In addition, the composite material maintained its oil adsorption ability over 10 cycles. The ease of fabrication of the magnetic super wetting 3D material sponge along with its durability and reusability makes it an interesting material with potential for practical applications.",,,,,,,,,134,11,0,0,33,0,141,,,1385-8947,1873-3212,,,,,,,,,,"Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R ChinaUniv Valenciennes, Univ Lille, Cent Lille, CNRS,ISEN,UMR 8520,IEMN, F-59000 Lille, FranceUniv Mouloud Mammeri, Fac Sci, Dept Chim, BP N 17 RP, Tizi Ouzou 15000, Algeria",,,,2020-01-07,WOS:000504405000115,,

The power generation of the country largely depends on the non-renewable (fossil fuel) energy sources, mainly on the natural gas as accounts 64.5% of recent installed capacity. This trend causes rapid depletion of non-renewable energy sources. Thus, it is necessary to trim down the dependency on non-renewable energy sources and utilize the available renewable resources to meet the huge energy demand facing the country. Most of the people living in rural, remote, coastal and isolated areas in Bangladesh have no electricity access yet. However, renewable energy resources, especially biomass can play a pivotal role to electrify those rural, remote, coastal and isolated areas in the country. Humankind has been using biomass as an energy source for thousands of years. This study assesses the bio-energy potential, utilization and related Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs) practice in Bangladesh. Improved cooking stove, biogas plant and biomass briquetting are the major RETs commonly practiced in Bangladesh. The assessment includes the potential of agricultural residue, forest residue, animal manure and municipal solid waste. The estimated total amount of biomass resource available for energy in Bangladesh in 2012-2013 is 90.21 million tons with the annual energy potential of 45.91 million tons of coal equivalent. The recoverable amount of biomass (90.21 million tons) in 2012-2013 has an energy potential of 1344.99 PJ which is equivalent to 373.71 TWh of electricity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The oily sludge is mainly residue or tank bottom sludge from storage tanks. The two main treatment methods currently used are incineration and thermal desorption (TD). Thermal desorption is a method where the waste material is heated in an anaerobic environment to release volatiles, the condensed volatiles can be used as a liquid fuel. For the thermal desorption unit dry contaminated soil is mixed with moist drill cuttings to generate a suitable mixture. TD -feedstock material has been thermo gravimetric analyzed (TGA) to find the proximate analysis, a bomb calorimeter is used to find the higher heating value (HHV) of the material. Ultimate analysis is performed with a CHNS-O flash analyzer. The results of these analyses are used to model co-gasification of TD -feedstock with tires. The Gibbs energy minimization method together with Lagrange Multiplier are used in a zero-dimensional model. TD-feedstock/tire mixture was varied as well as the air/fuel ratio.

The development of renewable energy not only contributes to the independence of energy supply, but also achieves benefits of economic development and environmental protection. Based upon information available to public, the present paper reassesses reserves of various renewable energies in Taiwan. The assessment includes seven kinds of renewable energies, namely, solar energy, wind power, biomass energy, wave energy, tidal energy, geothermal energy and hydropower, which are all commercialized and matured in terms of current technologies. Other renewable energies, which have not proven as matured as the aforementioned ones, are only assessed preliminarily in this paper, such as second generation of biomass, deep geothermal energy, the Kuroshio power generation and ocean thermal energy conversion.According to the estimation of this paper, the reserve of wind energy, up to 29.9 kWh/d/p (i.e., kWh per day per person), is the largest one among seven kinds of renewable energies in Taiwan, followed by 24.27 kWh/d/p of solar energy, 4.55 kWh/d/p of biomass, 4.58 kWh/d/p of ocean energy, 0.67 kWh/d/p of geothermal energy and 16.79 kWh/d/p of hydropower. If regarding biomass as a primary energy, and assuming 40% being the average efficiency to convert primary energy into electricity, the total power of the seven kinds of renewable energy reserves is about 78.03 kWh/d/p, which is equal to 2.75 times of 28.35 kWh/d/p of national power generation in 2008. If the reserves of 54.93 kWh/d/p estimated from other four kinds of renewable energies that have not technically matured yet are also taken into account, it will result that the reserves of renewable energy in Taiwan can be quite abundant.Although the results of the assessment point out that Taiwan has abundant renewable energy resources, the four inherent shortcomings - low energy density, high cost of power generation, instability of power supply, and current cost of renewable energy being still higher than that of fossil energy - have to be overcome first, before renewable energy is actually formed as a main component in national energy mix. The measures executed by government to break through these barriers further include the upgrade of the technological level, the formulation of the necessary policies, and the work together from all levels for the overall promotion.

Because of this, it provides a remarkable model to study the complex links existing between resilience and safety. Paradoxically, even if the huge risks being run cause many shipwrecks (low safety level), studies show that these sailors avoid an even greater number of accidents thanks to their exceptional skill and know-how (remarkable resilience level). This article examines several ways of improving safety in an activity of this type.Method: Two intervention strategies are tested: (i) a micro-ergonomics strategy offering conduct assistance guidelines based on accident analyses of the most serious and frequent causes (collisions while fishing); (ii) a macro-ergonomics strategy comparing the safety level of large firms having committed to a Total Quality approach, to that of smaller companies, often privately owned.Result: Neither of the two strategies works out as expected. The micro-ergonomics anti-collision assistance strategy is misused towards an increase of the fishing objective; the macro-ergonomics strategy is even more surprising: the largest firms suffer from a smaller number of shipwrecks, but a much greater number of work-related injuries; the strategy simply results in a minor shift of the sacrificial decision between performance and safety (loss of men vs. loss of vessels), while maintaining the same priority for financial performance.Discussion: The article submits a simple modeling of the relationship between resilience and safety, and discusses the choice of strategies for safety-improving interventions, taking into account the system's financial performance and the legal pressure to which it is subjected.

The newly generated information was used to support discussions with the participating farmers in the search for options to design more profitable and sustainable farming systems in Queensland Australia. The four case studies contrasted in key systems characteristics: opportunism in decision making, i.e. flexible versus rigid crop rotations; function, i.e. production of livestock or crops; and level of intensification, i.e. dryland versus irrigated agriculture. Tested tactical and strategic changes under a baseline and climate change scenario (CCS) involved changes in the allocation of land between cropping and grazing enterprises, alternative allocations of limited irrigation water across cropping enterprises, and different management rules for planting wheat and sorghum in rainfed cropping. The results show that expected impacts from a likely climate change scenario were evident in the following increasing order: the irrigated cropping farm case study, the cropping and grazing farm, the more opportunistic rainfed cropping farm and the least opportunistic rainfed cropping farm. We concluded that in most cases the participating farmers were operating close to the efficiency frontier (i.e. in the relationship between profits and risks). This indicated that options to adapt to climate change might need to evolve from investments in the development of more innovative cropping and grazing systems and/or transformational changes on existing farming systems. We expect that even though assimilating expected changes in climate seems to be rather intangible and premature for these farmers, as innovations are developed, adaptation is likely to follow quickly. The multiple interactions among farm management components in complex and dynamic farm businesses operating in a variable and changing climate, make the use of whole farm participatory modelling approaches valuable tools to quantify benefits and trade-offs from alternative farming systems designs in the search for improved profitability and resilience.

Many nations seek secure energy supplies, combined with low costs, and sustainable environmental impacts. Most of world energy currently derives from combustion of fossil fuel. The UK is no exception.In the UK, fossil fuel (oil) dominates transport use, and is difficult to change in the near future. Electricity and heat generation is dominated by gas (41%) and coal (34%), with 20% from nuclear, only 3% from renewables, and 2% imported electricity. This gas and coal will from now onwards largely be imported, paying costs to suppliers outside the UK. This also means security of supply is not guaranteed. Can improvements be made to the use of these energy sources?A key environmental problem is that fossil fuel combustion releases fossil CO2 to the atmosphere. This is now, beyond reasonable doubt, linked to global warming and climate change. Atmospheric CO2 also dissolves in ocean water, forcing an increased acidity greater than any time in the past 20 Million years. Even those who still do not believe in climate change cannot escape the inevitability of ocean acidification / with as yet un-predicted consequences. For this reason alone, atmospheric CO2 must be reduced.To enable continued use of fossil fuels, whilst renewable sources are developed, it is an urgent requirement to de-carbonise their combustion.

Current industrial systems rely on chemical absorption by solvents, but require a very high energy input, which reduces the environmental gain. The Centre will focus on new technologies of CO2 separation by adsorption onto nanoporous materials materials, by filtration of CO2 from power plant flue gases by newly created semi-permeable membranes, and by membrane separation of oxygen from air, to enable oxy-fuel combustion and efficient CO2 separation.Secondly, we acknowledge that there is, and will be, a need to remove existing CO2 emissions from the atmosphere. The reductions proposed from power plant emissions do not reduce existing CO2, they just make the increase slower. To control the earth atmosphere and produce a sustainable climate requires extraction of CO2 already emitted. This is routinely achieved, at low cost, by vegetation.

However, changes in pollutant profiles are expected due to increasing urbanisation and commercial-industrial activities. This study aims to determine the variation of surface 03 concentration recorded at seven selected stations in Malaysian Borneo. Hourly surface 03 data covering the period 2002 to 2013, obtained from the Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE), were analysed using statistical methods. The results show that the concentrations of 03 recorded in Malaysian Borneo during the study period were below the maximum Malaysian Air Quality Standard of 100 ppbv. The hourly average and maximum 03 concentrations of 31 and 92 ppbv reported at Bintulu (S3) respectively were the highest among the 03 concentrations recorded at the sampling stations. Further investigation on 03 precursors show that sampling sites located near to local petrochemical industrial activities, such as Bintulu (S3) and Miri (S4), have higher NO2/NO ratios (between 3.21 and 5.67) compared to other stations. The normalised 03 values recorded at all stations were higher during the weekend compared to weekdays (unlike its precursors) which suggests the influence of 03 titration by NO during weekdays. The results also show that there are distinct seasonal variations in 03 across Borneo. High surface 03 concentrations were usually observed between August and September at all stations with the exception of station 57 on the east coast. Majority of the stations (except Si and S6) have recorded increasing averaged maximum concentrations of surface 03 over the analysed years. Increasing trends of NO2 and decreasing trends of NO influence the yearly averaged maximum of 03 especially at S3. This study also shows that variations of meteorological factors such as wind speed and direction, humidity and temperature influence the concentration of surface O-3. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

On the solodic soil, Agrocote (R) CR N was twice as efficient as urea-N; cane yield at 80 kg Agrocote (R)-N was equivalent to that achieved with 160 kg urea-N. On the same soil type, CR N significantly (P <= 0.05) increased cane yields by 10 t/ha above that achieved with 160 kg urea-N/ha, the maximum recommended N rate under Six Easy Steps. Compared to urea, Agrocote (R) increased (P <= 0.05) cane yield by an average of 4.8 t/ha on the clay soil. There were no significant yield responses to controlled release K. In the Herbert valley, controlled release was an effective tool to increase N-use efficiency and to manage risks associated with N-loss during heavy rainfall events. Controlled release fertilisers may reduce environmental losses and provide productivity gains in high rainfall environments.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,0,11,,,0020-8841,,,,,,,,,,,"Herbert Cane Prod Serv Ltd, Ingham, AustraliaEverris Australia Pty Ltd, Bella Vista, Australia",Herbert Cane Prod Serv LtdEverris Australia Pty Ltd,,,2014-02-12,WOS:000329878300029,,

Due to the growing population in the world, dependence on oil continues despite the search for clean and sustainable alternative energy sources. Just like all fossil-based energy sources, it is a fact that the use of oil causes air pollution, indirectly pollution of land and water resources, and the most important problem of today, global warming. Oil spills are one of the causes of this pollution. Natural and artificial oil spills cause oil pollution and cause damage that is difficult to recycle in the environment. Petroleum poses a serious risk to water resources in the pre-use phase. In this study; it will be investigated whether there is any pollutant effect on the fresh water resources in the pre-use stages of oil exploration, production, transportation, processing and storage. As a research area, Diyarbakir Province, which is located in the north of the Upper Mesopotamian Basin, where all phases (systems) before use such as exploration, production, transmission, storage and treatment (refining) are found altogether. Almost all of the oil production in Turkey is provided from the South-eastern Anatolia Region. With daily crude oil production, Diyarbakir is the second largest producer of crude oil after Batman. In Diyarbakir province there are 42 Oil Fields operated by various oil producers and over 260 Oil Wells are located in these fields. In the scope of this study; In Diyarbakir province, active or inactive oil fields and their locations will be determined and their impact areas will be determined. Underground and surface water resources (existing wells, streams and natural and artificial lakes) being in the impact area will be identified and their locations will be processed on the map. Samples will be taken from the water sources along with the field study. Physical and chemical analyzes of the samples will be performed.

It has been carried out by the Regional Epidemiological Observatory within the domain of ESA (Epidemiology Development and Environment) and with the support of the European Union. Eighteen areas (for a total of 73 municipalities) were identified a priori as potentially polluted, accounting for a population of 917,977 in 2001 census (56% of the total population of Sardinia). The areas have been named after the most important town, as listed below (in brackets rounded 2001 population), major activities in industrial areas are briefly described.INDUSTRIAL AREAS: Portoscuso (59,000). Processing of aluminium and other metals. Foundry. Power plants. Dismissed mines (mainly coal mining, lead, zinc). Plants for storing and treating special wastes. Italian Law 349/1986 classified this area as at high risk of environmental crisis and classified some plants as being at high technological risk (Norma Seveso Decree 334/1999).

Ill defined causes of death were 1.4% in males and 2.5% in females (vs corresponding estimates of 1.1% and 1.4% in Italy). Compared to Italian national data, regional age-standardized estimates were higher in Sardinia for infectious diseases (23% in males and 12% in females), respiratory diseases (22% and 14%: pneumoconiosis was more than 6 times more frequent in Sardinia than in Italy), diseases of the digestive system (26% and 9%: for liver cirrhosis, the excess was 33% in males and 9% in females; corresponding figures for liver cancer were 13% and 16%), breast cancer in females (5%). On the other hand, regional mortality rates were lower than the national rates for cardiovascular diseases (-1.3% and -7.4% in males and females respectively), all cancers considered as a whole (-9% and -7%) and lung cancer (-5% and -32%). Regional and national death rates for non Hodgkin lymphoma in both sexes and for leukaemia in females were almost identical, whereas the latter rate in males was slightly higher in Sardinia than in Italy (9.4 vs 8.4 x100,000 person-years). Particularly in men, the differences in mortality rates from all causes and from cardiovascular, respiratory diseases and lung cancer among the four traditional Provinces (Cagliari, Nuoro, Oristano and Sassari) were greater than the difference between Sardinia and Italy. Remarkably enough, also death rates from lymphohaemopoietic tumours were more heterogeneous within Sardinia.RESULTS IN THE INVESTIGATED AREAS: Rates of hospital discharges in Sardinia showed a high variability, which is partly attributable to differences in the availability of both hospital beds and alternative forms of care. This heterogeneity must be taken into account in the interpretation of rates of hospital discharge. These were relatively high in some areas (Cagliari, Iglesias, Portoscuso, Tortoli) and low in others (Olbia, Porto Torres, Sassari). All the reported observed/expected ratios were based on material deprivation adjusted figures. All the estimated statistics were reported with 90% Confidence Interval.INDUSTRIAL AREAS: In 1997-2001, deaths from respiratory diseases were significantly in excess in males in Portoscuso (obs/exp 205/124.77) and in San Gavino (69/46.77). Deaths from pneumoconiosis were recorded sporadically, with the exception of Portoscuso, where the excess was impressive (obs/exp 112/30.46). SMRs for lung cancer in males ranged between 0.62 in Ottana and 1.22 in San Gavino, with statistically significant departure from expected values in Portoscuso and Sarroch (both with SMR significantly in excess in males: 1.24). In Porto Torres mortality from all causes was in significant excess in both sexes (SMRs 1.04 in males and 1.09 in females), for respiratory diseases (1.08 and 1.28), for diseases of the digestive system (1.13 and 1.21), for all cancers (1.04 and 1.09). Liver cancer deaths were also in excess in both sexes (SMRs 1.18 and 1.21). The latter finding is confirmed by incidence rates from the local cancer registry. Among industrial areas, Porto Torres was also the one with a stronger evidence of an excess of deaths from lymphohaemopoietic cancer in males (obs/exp 99/83.60) and females (73/68.20).MINING AREAS: These areas are characterized by statistically significant excesses of mortality in males, largely caused by non neoplastic respiratory conditions (obs/exp 119/86.41 in Iglesias and 156/62.55 in Arbus). In recent years, deaths from pneumoconiosis averaged 20 per year in Arbus and 10 per year in Iglesias. Lung cancer in males was also significantly in excess in both areas (obs/exp 72/56.38 in Arbus and 108/72.14 in Iglesias). There is a time trend (1981-2001) towards a decrease of mortality from respiratory conditions, which nevertheless remains largely in excess over the regional average also in the most recent period.MILITARY AREAS: Statistically significant excesses of deaths and hospital discharges for non Hodgkin lymphoma were detected in La Maddalena (mortality, 1981-2001, in males 17 observed cases vs 6.13 expected, in females 8/5.64). In Salto di Quirra in 1997-2001 deaths from myeloma (in males 5/2.3) and leukaemias were increased in both sexes (total obs/exp 20/13.3, statistically non significant).URBAN AREAS: Urban areas in Sardinia are relatively well developed with high values of socioeconomic indicators. The health profile in Cagliari and Sassari is typical of towns of the Western world. In Cagliari there is a higher mortality for colorectal, breast, cervical and lung cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Environmental (non occupational) pollution might explain some of the observed excesses of disease in the investigated industrial areas of Sardinia, particularly in women, less likely to be exposed to hazards in the work environment, whereas in the mining areas studied the disease pattern suggests a major role of occupational exposures. On the other hand, the causal links between disease occurrence and exposures in the screened military areas remain uncertain. The disease patterns in the cities of Sardinia are likely to be associated with lifestyle and urban pollution. Historically, southern Italian Regions have been characterized by an advantage over the rest of the country in terms of health, but during the last decade such advantage tended to vanish. Sardinia confirms this secular trend. However in the most recent years studied, overall age-standardized mortality rate in Sardinian females still remains lower than Italian average, but this is not the case for males any more. Differences in the health profile between residents in different areas of Sardinia have been found to be far greater than the difference between Sardinia as a whole and Italy. A major contribution to intraregional differences is given by the 18 investigated areas where excesses were registered for: respiratory diseases (including cancer) in the industrial areas of Portoscuso, Sarroch and Porto Torres, and in the mining areas; diseases of the digestive tract, liver cancer and lymphohaemopoietic cancer in the area of Porto Torres; cancer of the lymphohaemopoietic system in some military areas; cancers of the colon and rectum, lung, breast and uterus in some of the major cities of the Region.",,,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,23,0,40,,,1120-9763,,,,,,,,,,,"Dipartimento di statistica G Parenti, Universita di Firenze. abiggeri@ds.unifi.it",,,,2006-01-01,MEDLINE:16826748,16826748,

However, such a scenario did not materialize. Results from a modeling approach suggest that the prevailing winds, through the drift they induced at the ocean surface, played a major role in pushing the oil toward the coasts along the northern Gulf, and, in synergy with the Loop Current evolution, prevented the oil from reaching the Florida Straits. This implies that both oceanic currents and surface wind-induced drift must be taken into account for the successful forecasting of the trajectories and landfall of oil particles, even in energetic environments such as the Gulf of Mexico. Consequently, the time range of these predictions is limited to the weather forecasting range, in addition to the range set up by ocean forecasting capabilities.",,,,,,,,,107,1,0,0,43,0,117,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Miami, CIMAS, Miami, FL 33149 USAUniv Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USAUniv Miami, CCS, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USAColorado Sch Mines, Golden, CO 80401 USAUSN, Res Lab, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USA",,,,2012-07-25,WOS:000305876500050,22676453,

We describe recent applications, developments, opportunities and limitations, mainly of the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (for topsoil (VESS) and for subsoil (SubVESS)), and of the Visual Soil Assessment (VSA). Data are taken from experiments on compaction and from assessments made in farmer's fields in the UK, Brazil and New Zealand. The methods are widely used to detect compaction and are well-suited for monitoring changes in compaction status, particularly in relation to weather extremes. VESS proved useful in distinguishing grazing vs wheel compaction in the UK and Brazil by permitting detection of layers at different depths within the topsoil zone. The depths of compact layers are important for scoring management decisions for soil improvement. However the use of scores as limiting thresholds in different soil types needs the support of further soil measurements and/or additional visual assessments of soil and crop. VSA and VESS were also used to estimate the risk of significant soil emissions of nitrous oxide where compaction damage was present and rates of mineral N fertiliser were high. Visual assessments also have the potential to assess the risk of surface water runoff and nutrient loss. The potential role of soil colour was shown for the further development of visual evaluation techniques for a soil carbon storage index. Visual soil evaluation techniques also provide a useful visual aid for improving soil awareness in groups of stakeholders, helping the exchange of knowledge and ideas for innovation in agriculture.

This extreme environment determines both machine types have to handle mixtures with a gas in liquid volume fraction (GVF) varying over a wide range (0 to 1). The gas (or liquid) content affects the system pumping (or compression) efficiency and reliability, and places a penalty in leakage and rotordynamic performance in secondary flow components, namely seals. In 2015, tests were conducted with a short length smooth surface annular seal (L/D = 0.36, radial clearance = 0.127 mm) operating with an oil 'in air mixture whose liquid volume fraction (LVF) varied to 4%. The test results with a stationary journal show the dramatic effect of a few droplets of liquid on the production of large damping coefficients. This paper presents further measurements and predictions of leakage, drag power, and rotordynamic force coefficients conducted with the same test seal and a rotating journal. The seal is supplied with a mixture (air in ISO VG 10 oil), varying from a pure liquid to an inlet GVF =0.9 (mostly gas), a typical range in multiphase pumps. For operation with a supply pressure (P-s) up to 3.5 bar (a), discharge pressure (P-a) =1 bar (a), and various shaft speed (Omega) to 3.5 krpm (Omega R = 23.3 m/s), the flow is laminar with either a pure oil or a mixture. As the inlet GVF increases to 0.9 the mass flow rate and drag power decrease monotonically by 25% and 85% when compared to the pure liquid case, respectively. For operation with P-s = 2.5 bar (a) and S2 to 3.5 krpm, dynamic load tests with frequency 0 < omega < 110 Hz are conducted to procure rotordynamic force coefficients. A direct stiffness (K), an added mass (M) and a viscous damping coefficient (C) represent well the seal lubricated with a pure oil. For tests with a mixture (GVF(max) = 0.9), the seal dynamic complex stiffness Re(H) increases with whirl frequency (co); that is, Re(H) differs from (K-omega M-2). Both the seal cross coupled stiffiiesses (K-XY and -K-YX) and direct damping coefficients (C-XX and C-YY) decrease by approximately 75% as the inlet GVF increases to 0.9. The finding reveals that the frequency at which the effective damping coefficient (C-XXeff = C-XX-K-XY/omega) changes from negative to positive (i.e., a crossover frequency) drops from 50% of the rotor speed (omega = 1/2 Omega) for a seal with pure oil to a lesser magnitude for operation with a mixture. Predictions for leakage and drag power based on a homogeneous bulk flow model match well the test data for operation with inlet GVF up to 0.9. Predicted force coefficients correlate well with the test data for mixtures with GVF up to 0.6. For a mixture with a larger GVF, the model under predicts the direct damping coefficients by as much as 40%. The tests also reveal the appearance of a self-excited seal motion with a low frequency; its amplitude and broad band frequency (centered at around similar to 12 Hz) persist and increase as the gas content in the mixture increase. The test results show that an accurate quantification of wet seals dynamic force response is necessary for the design of robust subsea flow assurance systems.",,,,,ASME Turbine Technical Conference and Exposition (Turbo Expo)ASME Turbine Technical Conference and Exposition (Turbo Expo),"JUN 26-30, 2017JUN 26-30, 2017",Int Gas Turbine Inst; ASMEInt Gas Turbine Inst; ASME,"Charlotte, NCCharlotte, NC",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,978-0-7918-5092-3,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Mech Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000412785600036,,

In this paper, we use New Zealand as a case study to comprehensively assess, compare and quantify the net climate change impact of shifting land use between temperate forest and grassland. Forests store large amounts of carbon in their biomass, whereas grasslands contain relatively little biomass carbon. These biomass changes tend to dominate the carbon balance under land-use change. Soil carbon stocks usually do not change much after deforestation unless subsequent erosion occurs, but some soil carbon is often lost when grasslands are reforested with exotic plantations. Forest soils usually release little nitrous oxide or methane and can even oxidise small amounts of methane. Grasslands, on the other hand, can release a large amount of nitrous oxide, which may be further increased with fertilisation, and is higher for cattle- than sheep-grazed systems. Grazing animals increase emissions because the concentrated forms of nitrogen in their excreta allow it to escape from the system. Ruminant animals can also emit large amounts of methane. Land cover change in addition has direct radiative effects through the amount of solar radiation that is either absorbed by vegetated surfaces or reflected back into space. As forests typically absorb more radiation than grasslands, this slightly negates the greenhouse consequences of changes in carbon storage, and methane and nitrous oxide emissions under land-use change.

This battery of biomarkers was akin to those formerly applied on mussels of 3.5-4.5 cm shell length for which there exist biomarker reference values in the studied geographical areas. The cause-effect relationship between biological responses and the different history of exposure to POS fuel oil was intricate for different reasons: (a) growth rate was dissimilar in mussels of the two studied localities and much lower than expected, (b) a chronological basis could not be directly associated to POS events (all mussels except the smallest from Galicia had been subjected to the direct POS impact at one or another stage of their life-cycle); and (c) some biomarkers and histopathology seemingly depended on size/age irrespectively of the locality and the POS chronology. As a whole, the present study gives a very useful set of reference values of biomarkers obtained for Mytilus galloproyincialis of different size-classes. Finally, it is recommended that Mussel Watch programmes should be designed by standardising the age of the sentinel mussels rather than their size, especially if the programme covers large or diverse geographical areas, if long-term trends are relevant or if significant pollution effects on growth are expected.

This extreme environment determines both machine types have to handle mixtures with a gas in liquid volume fraction (GVF) varying over a wide range (0-1). The gas (or liquid) content affects the system pumping (or compression) efficiency and reliability, and places a penalty in leakage and rotordynamic performance in secondary flow components, namely seals. In 2015, tests were conducted with a short length smooth surface annular seal (L/D = 0.36, radial clearance = 0.127 mm) operating with an oil in air mixture whose liquid volume fraction (LVF) varied to 4%. The test results with a stationary journal show the dramatic effect of a few droplets of liquid on the production of large damping coefficients. This paper presents further measurements and predictions of leakage, drag power, and rotordynamic force coefficients conducted with the same test seal and a rotating journal. The seal is supplied with a mixture (air in ISO VG 10 oil), varying from a pure liquid to an inlet GVF = 0.9 (mostly gas), a typical range in multiphase pumps. For operation with a supply pressure (P-s) up to 3.5 bar(a), discharge pressure (P-a) = 1 bar(a), and various shaft speed (Omega) to 3.5 krpm (Omega R = 23.3 m/s), the flow is laminar with either a pure oil or a mixture. As the inlet GVF increases to 0.9 the mass flow rate and drag power decrease monotonically by 25% and 85% when compared to the pure liquid case, respectively. For operation with P-s = 2.5 bar(a) and Omega to 3.5 krpm, dynamic load tests with frequency 0< omega< 110 Hz are conducted to procure rotordynamic force coefficients. A direct stiffness (K), an added mass (M), and a viscous damping coefficient (C) represent well the seal lubricated with a pure oil. For tests with a mixture (GVF(max) = 0.9), the seal dynamic complex stiffness Re(H) increases with whirl frequency (omega); that is, Re(H) differs from (K - omega M-2). Both the seal cross coupled stiffnesses (K-XY and -K-YX) and direct damping coefficients (C-XX and CYY) decrease by approximately 75% as the inlet GVF increases to 0.9. The finding reveals that the frequency at which the effective damping coefficient (C-XXeff = C-XX - K-XY/omega) changes from negative to positive (i. e., a crossover frequency) drops from 50% of the rotor speed (omega = 1/2 Omega) for a seal with pure oil to a lesser magnitude for operation with a mixture. Predictions for leakage and drag power based on a homogeneous bulk flow model match well the test data for operation with inlet GVF up to 0.9. Predicted force coefficients correlate well with the test data for mixtures with GVF up to 0.6. For a mixture with a larger GVF, the model under predicts the direct damping coefficients by as much as 40%. The tests also reveal the appearance of a self-excited seal motion with a low frequency; its amplitude and broad band frequency (centered at around similar to 12 Hz) persist and increase as the gas content in the mixture increase. The test results show that an accurate quantification of wet seals dynamic force response is necessary for the design of robust subsea flow assurance systems.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,0,16,,,0742-4795,1528-8919,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Mech Engn Dept, ASME, College Stn, TX 77843 USATexas A&M Univ, Mech Engn Dept, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,,,2017-12-06,WOS:000415792800012,,

In this manuscript we report the unique experience of DXA performed on the relic of a Saint; in particular we analyzed a skeletal fragment of St. Nicholas, kept in the Basilica of Bari (Italy) since 1087. Material and Methods: The bone to be examined consisted of the posterior arch of the ninth left rib that was 12cm long, 1.2cm maximum width and 1.7cm thick at the body. The data acquired from the densitometric study were performed using the anthropometric measures reported in historical records of St. Nicholas' life: sex (male), age (75 years), weight (70kg), height (167cm), and ethnicity (Caucasian). In addition to the examination of the relic, a comparison assessment was made with the rib of a healthy 60 years old man (height of 170cm, without known skeletal pathologies). This sample had a length of 19cm, maximum width at the head 1cm, and 0.7cm thick at the body. The analysis of bone fragments is different from the analysis of bones in the context of the human body (where soft tissues are placed around the skeleton); for this reason, one of the most critical issues was to create a support that would allow the analysis of bone fragments. We simulated conditions similar to those occurring in patients: a density scale was established, using a specific plexiglass phantom on which the bone fragments to be examined were placed. From the analysis it was calculated the parameter bone mineral density (BMD), express in g/cm2, that indicates the relation between mass of bone mineral content and area of examined bone segment. BMD data was compared to a range normalized by age, sex and ethnicity (BMD-N). Results: The results of the scannnig of St. Nicholas' rib showed a BMD of 0.97g/cm2 with a BMD-N between 0.77 and 1.08g/cm2. Simultaneous measurements of the relic compared with a reference rib showed highlighted BMD of 0.84g/cm2 for the relic and 0.50g/cm2 for the reference rib. The St. Nicholas data are 168% higher than reference bone. All our measurements of the relic indicated a high bone mineral density, most likely due to the presence of a high concentration of calcium salts. A relatively higher mineral density of the relic was seen compared to the healthy subject's rib. From the history of St Nicholas' life, we know of the long imprisonment at the age of 51 in damp and unhealthy environment. The results of this study suggest that a good bone mineral density was maintained by the Saint even in old age. An additional element that can influence bone mineral density is diet, certainly different during the time of St. Nicholas. The good bone densitometry indicates that the Saint maintained a proper diet, with a generally fair state of health. Conclusion: For this first DXA analysis of the rib relic of Saint Nicholas was necessary a long and complex experimental work to modify standard technique procedure to particular and unusual sample and Create specific supports and complementary instruments. Perform DXA analysis on relics permit to obtain additional information to living conditions, economical situation, behaviours, diet, diseaes, conservations conditions of remains, change of life style in different age.Our experimental work, the first of its kind, creates the way to analyze precious relics that often include only few bone fragments and data obtained by our work can be useful for a better management and movement of fragile relics.

The analysis is conducted by region given that interfactor/interfuel elasticities of substitution are often discrepant among different areas. The results indicate that nearly 3% reduction in CO2 emissions from the 2010 level can be achieved by levying a carbon tax at 50 Yuan/tonne. The inelastic demand for fuel inputs in the face of rapid processes for industrialization and urbanization limits the effectiveness of China's carbon tax to a great extent. Specifically, a total amount of more than 130 million tonnes CO2 emissions can be reduced in the East coast and Southwest areas, and the areas of Municipalities and Northwest could also achieve CO2 mitigation by more than 3%.

Oil viscosity had a minor to no influence on entrainment rate, until a certain threshold above which entrainment was impeded.The mean droplet size scales with the modified Weber number as described by Johansen.

The herded slick thicknesses (3-8 mm) were ignitable in each experiment. The presence of ice caused fracturing of the oil during the herding process, which reduced the size of the herded slicks and, as a consequence, their ignitability, which in turn decreased the burning efficiency. Burning efficiencies relative to the ignited fraction of the oil were in the expected range (42-86%). This shows that the herder will be an effective tool for in-situ burning of oil when the ignitability issues due to fracturing of the oil are resolved. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To minimize the ecological damage and optimize rapid response, emergency managers need to be informed with how fast and where oil will spread as soon as possible after a spill. The state-of-the-art operational oil spill forecast modeling system improves the oil spill response into a new stage. However uncertainty due to predicted data inputs often elicits compromise on the reliability of the forecast result, leading to misdirection in contingency planning. Thus understanding the forecast uncertainty and reliability become significant. In this paper, Monte Carlo simulation is implemented to provide parameters to generate forecast probability maps. The oil spill forecast uncertainty is thus quantified by comparing the forecast probability map and the associated hindcast simulation. A HyosPy-based simple statistic model is developed to assess the reliability of an oil spill forecast in term of belief degree. The technologies developed in this study create a prototype for uncertainty and reliability analysis in numerical oil spill forecast modeling system, providing emergency managers to improve the capability of real time operational oil spill response and impact assessment.

The precursors of these compounds were not identified despite using a wide range of analytical tools, including gas chromatography (GC). To search for these precursors, over 40 samples were analyzed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC), one of the largest studies of its kind to date. Partial least squares regression was employed to elucidate the GC x GC peaks that could be the precursors of OxHC in our samples. We found that the formation of OxHC correlated with the disappearance of saturated hydrocarbons, including alkylcyclopentanes, alkyl cyclohexanes, alkylated bicyclic saturated compounds, tricyclic terpanpoids, and alkylbenzenes.

Water retention and emulsion phase (e.g., o/w vs. w/o) are determined by SL-structure/concentration, oil concentration, and oil composition to understand their performance for crude oil transportation and clean-up.

C storage and distribution in stemwood, coarse woody debris, forest (floor litter (L) + fermentation/humus(FH)-layers) and upper (0-0.1 m) mineral soil were measured along a stand development sequence in montane zone mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) forest in the Craigieburn Range, central South Island. C storage in all pools peaked in 125-year-old pole stands (219 Mg/ha) and declined as the stands matured (>150 years old, 192 Mg/ha), and were replaced by seedling stands (10 years old, 152 Mg/ha) following windthrow, to reach a low point (114 Mg/ha) in 25-year-old sapling stands. Coarse woody debris provided an important pool for C storage following catastrophic forest disturbance, and varied reciprocally with stemwood along the development sequence. Above-ground components showed a much greater range (88 Mg/ha) with stand development than forest floor and mineral soil components (16 Mg/ha). Stemwood and coarse woody debris components varied by 136 and 76 Mg/ha, respectively, while litter, the FH-layer and upper mineral soil C varied by 4, 17, and 12 Mg/ha, respectively. The sum of forest floor and mineral soil C ranged between 53 Mg/ha (sapling stage) and 69 Mg/ha (pole stage), and did not differ significantly with age.The litter and FH-layers, and mineral soil were re-sampled after a period of 8 years in the sapling and pole stands. C storage in the litter layers did not change significantly over this period. C storage in the FH-layer declined significantly by 9.7 Mg/ha in the pole stage, but showed little change in the sapling stage. It is hypothesised that C loss resulting from ongoing decomposition in the FH-layer was balanced by continuing inputs of coarse woody debris in the sapling stage, but not in the pole stage, where the coarse woody debris resource was relatively small. There was no change in mineral soil C storage over the 8-year period. It is concluded that, in the absence of disturbance, C storage in the forest floor may vary substantially over periods of <10 years, in contrast to the mineral soil where it appears relatively stable over decadal time intervals.

In addition, a comparison between the proposed APU system and a conventional system is presented. The work presents an analysis of the different environmental impacts regarding the proposed design and manufacturing method. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology following ISO 14040-44.approach has been adopted for the analysis as it enables a holistic view of the environmental behaviour of the studied system. LCA is a methodology to assess each and every impact associated along the whole value chain of a process or product. This assessment based on the entire life cycle of the system, from the raw materials production to the final disposal has been performed. For this purpose, an extensive data collection focusing on resources consumption (energy and materials) and emissions has been executed to ensure that all the life cycle stages are properly characterized. The results disclose that the production of the APU system is the main source of the environmental impacts. Specifically, for Global Warming Potential (GWP) indicator, the production phase contributes to 54% to the overall value for this impact category. Detailed comparative analysis of different fabrication approaches reveal that the environmental impact can be minimised and is diminish in any case when compared to conventional APU systems (reduction of 45% CO2 equivalent emissions and 88% Primary Energy consumption compared to conventional Diesel APU systems)Results highlighted that the replacement of silver wires by the lanthanum chromium material could reduce significantly the non-fossil Abiotic Depletion Potential impact (88% reduction) and the Marine Toxicity Potential impact (18% reduction). For cutting down the GWP and the primary energy impacts it should be applied a global reduction of the energy consumed in the manufacturing and an improving in the system efficiency.

The results show that PAHs levels in soils ranged from 45.12 to 158.00 ng/g and the urban areas presented the highest concentrations, mainly associated with the presence of a nearby highway and several roads with heavy traffic. PAHs levels in vegetation samples ranged from 42.13 to 80.08 ng/g, where the greatest influence came from the urban and petrochemical areas. In the case of SMs, levels in soils and vegetation samples ranged from 5.42 to 10.04 ng/g and from 4.08 to 17.94 ng/g, respectively, and in both cases, background areas (at least 30 km away from the main SVOCs emission sources) showed the highest levels, suggesting an influence of the personal care products derived from beach-related tourism in the coast. PCBs (from 6.62 to 14.07 ng/g in soils; from 0.52 to 4.41 ng/g in vegetation) prevailed in the chemical area in both matrices, probably associated with the presence of two sub-electrical stations located in the vicinities. In general terms, BFRs and HCB values recorded in soil and vegetation samples were quite similar between matrices and sampling areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Land loss at all three locations shifts from interior to shoreline loss between the two periods. In the second period, interior loss through the process of submergence is still occurring but at much reduced rates at locations 1 and 2.

The hydrokinetic industry has advanced beyond the initial testing phase and will soon install demonstration projects with arrays of full-scale devices. By reviewing the current state of the industry and the cutting edge research this paper identifies the key advancements required for HEC technology to become commercially successful at the utility scale. The primary hurdles are: (i) reducing the cost of energy, (ii) optimizing individual turbines to work in concert considering array and bathymetry effects, (iii) balancing energy extraction with environmental impact, and (iv) addressing socioeconomic concerns.This review is split into three primary sections. The first section provides an overview of the HEC technology systems that are most likely to be installed in commercial arrays. The second section is an in-depth literature review. The literature review is sub-divided into five areas that are positioned to significantly impact the viability of HEC technology: (i) site assessment, (ii) turbine design, (iii) turbine wake modeling, (iv) array performance, and (v) environmental impact.

However, the lack in understanding of the influence of salinity interactions on MEOR processes had led to unreliable prediction of MEOR performance, and non-development of efficient strategies to improve the MEOR performance. Hence, analysing the influence of salinity interactions on MEOR processes would make the prediction of MEOR processes more realistic, and thereby, it could assist in development of suitable strategies to enhance the oil recovery. Thus, in the present study, a novel mathematical model has been developed by coupling the Multiple Ion (Na, Ca, Mg, Cl, SO4) Exchange (MIE) transport model with the MEOR model, and it has been solved numerically by finite volume technique. The MIE transport model simulates the resultant spatial and temporal salinity distribution within the reservoir due to the mixing of IW and FW salinities during microbial flooding. The MEOR model simulates the coupled multiphase fluid (water-oil) flow and multispecies (microbes-nutrients) reactive transport processes within the reservoir, and finally predicts the oil recovery due to microbial flooding. Subsequently, the influence of IW and FW at different salinities on MEOR processes has been investigated. The present numerical results were validated with the experimental and analytical results. The results clearly suggest that the in-situ FW salinity was completely altered to the externally injected IW salinity, and this IW salinity dictates the entire MEOR processes as against the conventionally assumed FW salinity. Further, it is revealed that lowering the IW salinity from 0.5M to 0.1M had recovered 4.5%-14% of Original Oil in Place (OOIP) higher than that of conventionally used IW (sea water) for microbial flooding. Moreover, the MEOR performance could be enhanced significantly in reservoirs with any initial FW salinity by adopting IW salinity closer to the salinity condition at which the microbial growth and biosurfactant production is maximum. Finally, the present work assists in the selection of suitable reservoir, microbes, and IW salinity for attaining maximum oil recovery by microbial flooding. Thus, the present work helps to enhance the performance of MEOR technique.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,0,10,,,0920-4105,1873-4715,,,,,,,,,,"Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Ocean Engn, Petr Engn Program, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India",,,,2018-04-02,WOS:000426417400037,,

Yet reliable values of effective diffusion coefficients are important to predict migration of hydrocarbon gases in unconventional reservoirs, dissipation of (explosive) gases through clay barriers in radioactive waste repositories, mineral alteration of seals to geological CO2 storage reservoirs, and contaminant migration through aquitards. In this study, small-angle and very small angle neutron scattering techniques have been utilized to determine a range of transport properties in mudrocks, including porosity, pore size distributions, and surface and volume fractal dimensions of pores and grains, from which diffusive transport parameters can be estimated. Using a fractal model derived from Archie's law, we calculate effective diffusion coefficients from these parameters and compare them to laboratory-derived effective diffusion coefficients for CO2, H-2, CH4, and HTO on either the same or related mudrock samples.

The predicted values were compared to laboratory diffusion measurements. The measured and modeled diffusion coefficients show good agreement, differing generally by less than factor 5.

To minimize the effects of mineral heterogeneity and wettability alteration, a synthetic sintered glass core was utilized and all coreflooding experiments were performed at low temperatures without any aging process. The effect of fluid-fluid interactions were investigated in both secondary and tertiary injection modes. pH measurements as well as UV-Vis spectroscopy and interfacial tension (IFT) analysis were performed on the effluent brine samples.Results: show that fluid-fluid interactions, mainly the dissolution of crude oil polar components into the brine, significantly affect brine physical and interfacial properties. In secondary injection scenario, two times diluted seawater (2SW), which has the lowest IFT value, exhibits the highest (81%) oil recovery factor. While the lowest recovery factor (60.75%) was observed for the case of formation water (FW) injection. To explore the effect of contacting time, after 48 h soaking, brine injection was resumed. The effluent pH measurement at this stage showed a reduction, where the UV-Vis spectroscopy and IFT measurements confirmed dissolution of the crude oil polar components into the brine. The results showed that as brine salinity decreases, the amount of dissociated polar components increases. pH value of ten times diluted sea water (10SW) was reduced from its initial value of 7.45 to 4.22, while FW exhibits minor pH variation. Consequently, 10SW, which dissolved highest amount of polar components, depicts the highest recovery factor (6%) after soaking. Contrary to this, in tertiary injection mode, the high amount of saline brine in the core (because of FW injection at secondary stage) hinders the potential for more production for SW, 2SW and 10SW injection as all resulted to lower recovery factor compared to their secondary counterparts.",,,,,,,,,51,3,0,0,0,0,55,,,0920-4105,1873-4715,,,,,,,,,,"Shiraz Univ, Sch Chem & Petr Engn, Shiraz, IranSharif Univ Technol, Chem & Petr Engn Dept, SUPRI, Tehran, Iran",,,,2019-09-17,WOS:000483927500039,,

Tourists, refugees, expatriates, migrants, investors and ethnographers (not necessarily mutually exclusive and certainly not unproblematic categories) in Malta today find themselves caught in one or more junctures between these two poles of hospitality. For Derrida too hospitality is constituted by a double injunction, an aporia between the unconditional and the conditional, simultaneously mutually necessary and mutually contradictory. With these two accounts of divided hospitality in hand, and on the basis of fieldwork in Malta, this article explores the operations of multiple overlapping levels of political, social, cultural, economic, religious and ethnic conditions placed on hospitality, whether at the level of households, communities, States and so on.

Recent attention to rising levels of atmospheric CO2 has directed attention to the stores of organic C in soils and to changes resulting from conversion of forest to cropping. However,the spatial distribution of carbon pools in forest soils is difficult to estimate because of the unavailability of reliable data. In southwest France, thick humic acid soils have developed from Quaternary silty alluvial deposits. The area of study is characterized by textural and climatic gradients. The objective of this work was to determine if relationships between these gradients and organic matter contents could be established, in order to make a spatial prediction of organic pools in forest soils, and to simulate future evolution under corn cropping. Soil samples were collected hom an oceanic zone of the French Pyrenean piedmont, ancient terraces of Pyrenean streams (southwest France), and from 11 sites. On each site, from 13 to 27 topsoil (0-30 cm) samples were collected from mature forests. A total of 194 samples were collected. Correlations between all climatic, geomorphological, and pedological data were calculated. The area of the terraces was delimited using a traditional geomorphologically based survey and stored into a geographical information system (ARC/INFO). This map was overlayed with a 1-km X 1-km grid, and probability level maps of organic C amounts in forest soils down to 30 cm were produced using a multiple linear model. This study shows that relating OM contents to spatial available parameters that might influence OM distribution can provide a useful tool to improve geographical prediction of was found to be the most important soil parameter influencing OM distribution.

No significant difference was found in SOC or TOC between sample times, suggesting that under the conditions we examined, neither 2 years nor an intervening significant rainfall event was sufficient to change the quantity or our capacity to detect SOC, and neither represented a barrier to soil carbon accounting. Low fertility, lightly wooded pastures had a slightly but significantly lower SOC concentration, particularly in the surface soil layers. However, no significant differences in TOC were detected between the three pasture systems studied, and from a carbon estimation perspective, they represent one, single dataset. A wide range in TOC values existed within the dataset that could not be explained by environmental factors. The TOC was weakly but significantly correlated with soil nitrogen and phosphorus, but a more significant pattern seemed to be the association of high TOC with proportionally larger subsoil (0.1-0.3m) organic carbon storage. This we attribute to historical, long-term rather than contemporary management. Of the SOC fractions, particulate organic carbon (POC) dominated in the surface layers but diminished with depth, whereas the proportion of humic carbon (HUM) and resistant organic carbon (ROC) increased with soil depth. The POC did not differ between the pasture systems but native pasture had larger quantities of HUM and ROC, particularly in the surface soil layers, suggesting that this pasture system tends to accumulate organic carbon in more resistant forms, presumably because of litter input quality and historical management.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,16,0,27,,,1838-675X,1838-6768,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, AustraliaNSW Off Environm & Heritage, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",,,,2014-01-22,WOS:000328733100009,,

Studies were carried out with juveniles, known to generally be more sensitive to environmental stress than adults. A set of enzyme activities involved in immune defence mechanisms and detoxification processes, i.e. superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catecholase-type phenoloxidase (PO), laccase-type PO and lysozyme were analysed in different oyster tissues, i.e. the gills, digestive gland and mantle, and in the plasma and the haemoycte lysate supernatant (HLS) of the haemolymph. Results indicated that total PAH body burdens were 2.7 times higher in the presence than in the absence of the chemical dispersant. After 2 days of exposure to chemically dispersed oil, alkylated naphthalenes accounted for 55% of the total PAH body burden, whereas alkylated fluorenes and alkylated dibenzothiophenes accounted for 80% when the chemical dispersant was absent. Importantly, a higher number of enzyme activities were modified when oil was chemically dispersed, especially in the plasma and gills. Moreover, independently of the presence or absence of chemical dispersant, oil exposure generally inhibited enzyme activities in the gills and plasma, while they were generally activated in the mantle and haemocytes. These results suggest that the gills and plasma constitute sensitive compartments in C. gigas, and that the mantle and haemocytes may play an important role in protection against xenobiotics. Among the six enzyme activities that were analysed in these body compartments, five were modulated in the chemical dispersion (CD) treatment while only half of the enzyme activities were modulated in the mechanical dispersion treatment. Furthermore, CD treatment effects were often observed following exposure, but also during depuration periods. These results suggest that immune and/or detoxification responses are likely to be affected when dispersants are used to treat oil spills in shallow waters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Along the climosequence, the current mean annual rainfall (MAR) varies within a 80 km transect from 6000 mm at the edge of the Plateau to 500 mm inland. Pedogenic carbonates occur in the MAR range of 500-1200 mm. In the semi-arid zone (MAR: 500-900 mm), carbonates occur (i) as rhick hardpan calcretes on pediment slopes and (ii) as nodular horizons in polygenic black soils (i.e. vertisols). In the sub-humid zone (MAR: 900-1500 mm), pedogenic carbonates are disseminated in the black soil matrices either as loose, irregular and friable nodules of millimetric size or as indurated botryoidal nodules of centimetric to pluricentimetric size. They also occur at the top layers of the saprolite either as disseminated pluricentimetric indurated nodules or carbonate-cemented lumps of centimetric to decimetric size.Chemical and isotopic (Sr-87/Sr-86) compositions of the carbonate fraction were determined after leaching with 0.25 N HCl. The corresponding residual fractions containing both primary minerals and authigenic clays were digested separately and analyzed. The trend defined by the Sr-87/Sr-86 signatures of both labile carbonate fractions and corresponding residual fractions indicates that a part of the labile carbonate fraction is genetically linked to the local soil composition. Considering the residual fraction of each sample as the most likely lithogenic source of Ca in carbonates, it is estimated that from 24% to 82% (55% on average) of Ca is derived from local bedrock weathering, leading to a consumption of an equivalent proportion of atmospheric CO2. These values indicate that climatic conditions were humid enough to allow silicate weathering: MAR at the time of carbonate formation likely ranged from 400 to 700 mm, which is 2- to 3-fold less than the current MAR at these locations.The Sr, U and Mg contents and the (U-234/U-238) activity ratio in the labile carbonate fraction help to understand the conditions of carbonate formation. The relatively high concentrations of Sr, U and Mg in black soil carbonates may indicate fast growth and accumulation compared to carbonates in saprolite, possibly due to a better confinement of the pore waters which is supported by their high (U-234/U-238) signatures, and/or to higher content of dissolved carbonates in the pore waters. The occurrence of Ce, Mn and Fe oxides in the cracks of carbonate reflects the existence of relatively humid periods after carbonate formation. The carbonate ages determined by the U-Th method range from 1.33 +/- 0.84 kyr to 7.5 +/- 2.7 kyr and to a cluster of five ages around 20 kyr, i.e. the Last Glacial Maximum period. The young occurrences are only located in the black soils, which therefore constitute sensitive environments for trapping and retaining atmospheric CO2 even on short time scales. The maximum age of carbonates depends on their location in the climatic gradient: from about 20 kyr for centimetric nodules at Mule Hole (MAR = 1100 mm/yr) to 200 kyr for the calcrete at Gundlupet (MAR = 700 mm/yr, Durand et al., 2007). The intensity of rainfall during wet periods would indeed control the lifetime of pedogenic carbonates and thus the duration of inorganic carbon storage in soils. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, government programmes focused on greenhouse gas emission abatement have provided incentives for conversion of cropland to permanent pastures.

Although gaining carbon credits is generally not the main driver for uptake of these practices, there is significant potential for soil carbon sequestration. We investigated SOC stocks across a chronosequence of pastures sown with temperate, perennial grasses in south-western Australia. This study presents a rare insight into short-and long-term carbon dynamics in a novel agricultural system, which has potential for greater uptake within this region.

Here we find that a decline in emissions of 1% year(-1) beginning today would place the frontier near 475 ppm and that when mitigation is postponed, options disappear (on average) at the rate of similar to 9 ppm year(-1), meaning that delays of more than a decade will likely preclude stabilization below a doubling. When constraints on the future decline rate of emissions are relaxed, a particular atmospheric target can be realized in many ways, with scenarios that allow longer postponement of emissions reductions requiring greater increases in the intensity of future mitigation. However, the marginal rate of substitution between future mitigation and present delay becomes prohibitively large when the balance is shifted too far toward the future, meaning that some amount of postponement cannot be fully offset by simply increasing the intensity of future mitigation. Consequently, these results suggest that a practical transition path to a given stabilization target in the most commonly cited range can allow, at most, one or two decades of delay.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,6,0,22,,,0165-0009,,,,,,,,,,,"Brookings Inst, Foreign Policy Studies Program, Washington, DC 20036 USAPrinceton Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USAPrinceton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Program, Princeton, NJ 08544 USAPrinceton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USAPrinceton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,,,2008-06-01,WOS:000256476100002,,

Quantify the impact of gypsum application on infiltration, runoff, bulk density, soil loss, and soil-water partitioning within the rooting zone on a Tifton soil in a sweet sorghum-peanut-cotton rotation. 1.2. Quantify the impact of gypsum on rooting depth and estimated plant available water in a Tifton soil in a sweet sorghum-peanut-cotton rotation. 1.3. Determine the effect of gypsum on above and below-ground winter cover crop biomass production and associated effects on soil carbon sequestration, summer crop biomass, yield index, and nitrogen use efficiency. 2. Characterize the effects of cropping system, soil management and residue removal rate on soil carbon, specifically how changes in soil carbon storage impact nitrogen use, soil water storage and crop water use, and soil erosion and carbon loss associated with extreme rainfall events. 3. Determine the effects of cropping system, soil management and residue removal rate on the levels and seasonality of trace gas (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions. 4. Assess the dissipation, fate, and transport of herbicides and fungicides in soil as a function of soil management and residue removal rate. 4.1. Evaluate pesticide soil persistence including metabolite accumulation and decay as influenced by soil properties, tillage, agronomic amendments, pesticide formulation, and pesticide mode and frequency of application. 4.2. Determine edge-of-field pesticide and degradates loads at the field scale as a function of crop type, gypsum application, and pesticide properties during cotton-sweet sorghum-peanut production with strip- and no-till management. Approach: This project will evaluate soil processes in cropping systems that incorporate biomass crops into traditional annual row crop rotations and that facilitate the conversion of idle and marginal agricultural lands to perennial biomass production systems. Goals will be accomplished through provision of: improved data (C&N accretion and cycling rates, water availability and quality effects, evapotranspiration estimates, yield potential and yield indices) for crop production and watershed model calibration; site-specific C and N cycling and trace gas data for the ARS GRACENet database and the Southern Multistate Research CommitteeÆs project S1048; soil quality and hydraulic data that will aid in the development of conservation practice targeting recommendations for sensitive landscape positions within farms and improve hillslope, small watershed, and riparian model parameterizations for Little River Experimental Watershed (LREW); improved understanding of the relationships between crop water use efficiency, soil characteristics (texture, bulk density, carbon content, soil-water holding capacities), and crop biomass production that will facilitate validation of soil water estimation by satellite; and improved information on the effects of conservation practice, future land use, and environmental change scenarios for the southeastern coastal plain region to integrated National Program AssessmentsÆ ôwhat-ifö analyses. Emphasis is placed on studies that: 1) define benefits of combining gypsum with conservation-tillage in row crop production systems; 2) use leguminous cover crops to improve the net energy balance of production systems that include biofuels feedstocks; 3) develop guidelines for appropriate nutrient (poultry manure and inorganic fertilizer nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and water amendment rates for perennial grass feedstock production systems; and 4) determine how agronomic and soil management practices impact the fate and soil persistence of herbicides used for control of glyphosate resistant weeds rapidly spreading through Southeastern landscapes.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,813210; ARS-0421727,,,,,,,,AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13229200,,

One such criterion can be reflected by the Cost of Averting a Tonne of oil Spilt (CATS) whereas its target value is updated by elaborating the inherent uncertainties of oil spill costs and establishing a value for the criterion's assurance factor. To this end, a value of $80,000/t is proposed as a sensible CATS criterion and the proposed value for the assurance factor F = 1.5 is supported by the retrieved Protection and Indemnity (P&I) Clubs' Annual Reports. It is envisaged that this criterion would allow the conversion of direct and indirect costs into a non-market value for the optimal allocation of resources between the various parties investing in shipping. A review of previous cost estimation models on oil spills is presented and a probability distribution (log-normal) is fitted on the available oil spill cost data, where it should be made abundantly clear that the mean value of the distribution is used for deriving the updated CATS criterion value. However, the difference between the initial and the updated CATS criterion in the percentiles of the distribution is small. It is found through the current analysis that results are partly lower than the predicted values from the published estimation models. The costs are also found to depend on the type of accident, which is in agreement with the results of previous studies. Other proposals on acceptance criteria are reviewed and it is asserted that the CATS criterion can be considered as the best candidate. Evidence is provided that the CATS approach is practical and meaningful by including examples of successful applications in actual risk assessments. Finally, it is suggested that the criterion may be refined subject to more readily available cost data and experience gained from future decisions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

NDBC processes and displays the resulting currents on the NDBC website. NDBC has recently implemented quality control algorithms agreed upon by industry and the government. The resulting imagery and data, including quality control flags, are available on the publicly available NDBC website. The quality control algorithms and flags are presented and comparisons of the resulting files are described.Oil companies must collect current profile data when drilling wells or operating production platforms in water greater than 400 meters deep. They are required to collect the data at 20 minute intervals and transmit the data via FTP to NDBC. The data are received, decoded, and quality controlled at NDBC. The current profiles are then formatted in TEmperature Salinity and Current (TESAC) messages and transmitted over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS). The data are also viewed over the NDBC website as columnar listings and current vector stick plots.In order to determine the quality control algorithms for the current profiles, a committee of oil company, industry, and government representatives determined an approach that includes both individual bin (depth level) and profile algorithms. The algorithms take advantage of the fact that the Teledyne RDI Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) collects error velocity, percent good statistics for 3 and 4 beams, and correlation matrices and echo amplitudes for each beam. The algorithms described in this presentation were then implemented and flags generated for each quality control test. A total of nine flags are assigned within the NDBC database. The flags indicate good data (3), suspect data (2), or bad (1) data. Only bad data are not reproduced or plotted on the NDBC real-time webpage. Results from the implementation are being reviewed, but a quick look indicates that the algorithms are returning accurate descriptions of the ADCP data. The stick plots of ocean current with depth are much cleaner following the quality control implementation.The implementation of the quality control algorithms was delayed by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which impacted both the NDBC and the oil industry in the Gulf of Mexico. NDBC is now resubmitting past data files through the quality control algorithms to insure that all data at NDCB have been quality controlled.

The objective of this laboratory study was to characterize the formed water-in-oil products and relate these properties to starting oil properties.Analysis of the starting oil properties of these water-in-oil types shows that the existence of each type relates to the starting oil viscosity and its asphaltene and resin contents. This confirms that water-in-oil emulsification is a result of physical stabilization by oil viscosity and chemical stabilization by asphaltenes and resins. This stabilization is illustrated using simple graphical techniques.Four water-in-oil types exist: stable, unstable, meso-stable and entrained. Each of these has distinct physical properties.

Compositional trends in effectiveness were shown to be governed by: (1) initial oil-water interfacial tension observed upon dispersant-oil-saltwater contact; (2) rate of increase (or decrease) from the initial interfacial tension as DOSS was rapidly lost to the aqueous phase; and (3) gradually slowing kinetics of dispersant adsorption to the oil-water interface as Span 80 concentration was increased, which ultimately diminished dispersion effectiveness considerably even as dynamic interfacial tension remained <10(-3) mN/m.

Both departments have established a virbant cross-disciplinary environment thanks to the current Bridging the Gaps grant held by the PI, Prof. Dugald Duncan. All named investigators are members of two major joint research institutes of the Edinburgh Research Partnership in Engineering and Mathematics (www.erp.ac.uk), the Maxwell Institute of Mathematical Sciences and the Edinburgh Collaboration of Subsurface Science and Engineering (ECOSSE). Both are part of the 22M funding initiative of the Scottish Funding Council to foster interdisciplinary research in mathematics and engineering across Edinburgh. Furthermore the Maxwell Institute is a partner in the 4.7M Science and Innovation Grant to found the interdisciplinary Numerical Algorithms and Intelligent Software Centre (NAIS).Our proposal aims to consolidate existing and create new cross-disciplinary collaborations that will complement and enhance the world-leading research profiles of MACS and IPE. We propose to explore the feasibility of novel mathematical approaches for multiscale modelling of three-phase (e.g. oil, gas, water) porous media flow. For this we will cross traditional boundaries between engineering disciplines (i.e. petroleum, hydrology, and industrial porous media applications), physics, and applied mathematics and have assmebled a team of experts from the different disciplines. Our studies will be highly speculative and adventurous because we simply do not know if a suitable alternative to three-phase Darcy's law can be developed in such a way that it can be solved in the mathematically robust and efficient manner that is required for successful use in daily engineering applications. However, an alternative is required because Darcy's law is intrinsically not valid in certain flow regimes, that is when one or more phases move as discontinuous blobs and ganglia. Yet it is exactly this situation that is of most interest to engineering, for example when predicting the migration of small volumes of toxic groundwater contaminants or residual oil in a depleted hydrocarbon reservoir. The high risk and speculative research nature of our work would not necessarily attract funding despite being of fundamental importance in many applications: It is too speculative and blue sky for industrial support where lead time to product is months, not years and would struggle to be funded from other sources due to its novely, interdisciplinarity, and range of approaches. Yet, if our initial studies show that an alternative to Darcy's law for three phase-flow is feasible, the outcomes will have a major impact on engineering and mathematical disciplines: A possible alternative or improvement of Darcy's law for three-phase flow will have a fundamental influence in improving enhanced oil recovery techniques. Such techniques aim to extract hydrocarbons from declining oil fields such as they are frequent in the U.K. sector of the North Sea and world-wide. They will also be the key to improving the remediation of groundwater contaminants, predicting subsurface CO2 storage, and a variety of other industrial porous media applications (e.g., wood processing). Our research will also tackle important and challenging mathematical and computational issues, such as development of efficient and reliable algorithms, upscaling methods, numerical stability and convergence proofs, or error estimation, all of which must be able to cope with the highly non-linear physics inherent to three-phase flow and the orders-of-magnitude variation in parameter and associated uncertainties arising in industrial applications.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/H025022/1,,,,,,,,Heriot-Watt University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15323703,,
J,,,,,,,,,Simon Robins,,Missing Migrants and Deaths at the EU's Mediterranean Border: Humanitarian Needs and State Obligations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 13 2015,2015,"The epidemic of deaths at the EU's southern shores has taken on a new urgency as the scale of the phenomenon increases. There has been an average of eight deaths a day for the last 14 years, and the problem is worsening. Yet the focus has remained on Europe, driven by references to the flood of migrants, and by a policy discussion centred almost exclusively around securing the borders of the EU. The 40,000 people believed to have died trying to enter the EU in the last 14 years remain faceless and anonymous, statistics that justify ever more draconian rhetoric in the capitals of the EU's member states. What remains largely undiscussed amid the data, however, is the fact that most of those who die are missing to those families, in the sense that they have no idea if loved ones who have migrated are dead or alive: the IOM estimates that more than half of the presumed deaths in the Mediterranean have not been verified. Where the bodies of migrants are found in the sea, or washed up on Europe's shores, they are often not identified. The result is that families in the migrants' countries of origin receive no information about what has happened to loved ones who have left. As with any unresolved loss, the ambiguity over the fate of the missing means mothers and wives, sons and daughters live between hope and despair, always waiting for news of their loved one, but never receiving it. The cemeteries of Europe's southern periphery contain anonymous bodies found on beaches after shipwrecks, for which serious identification efforts have not been made. In Lebsos, the Greek island where the greatest recent rise in deaths has occurred, the local population is traumatised by these deaths, and local officials are paralysed because resources and policies from Athens concern only the management of living migrants. In contrast to the extensive regulation of migration by the Greek state, there are no regulatory provisions with regard to the identification and burial of the dead. As a result, local authorities - with capacities eviscerated by the economic crisis - improvise responses, with the possibility of identifying the dead compromised by a lack of political will, expertise and resources. A visit to the local cemetery in Mytilene, Lesbos's main city, reveals human remains lightly covered by earth, the only mark on the graves a broken stone, on which is written the (purported) nationality of the migrant, a number, and the date of death. No effort is made to collect post-mortem data that could be linked to the human remains in the ground, and thus aid identification. Local communities by and large reject the language of security in which the issue is wrapped by central governments: they see migrants continuously arriving - both living and dead - and understand that this is a humanitarian issue. While the EU and its member states devote huge resources to the control of their maritime borders, there is an acute lack of resources dedicated to addressing the humanitarian impact of unidentified migrant bodies. Data to count the number of dead have never been systematically collected by states. EU states have the capacity to create a system in which migrant bodies are dignified, with an appropriate burial, and data is collected to maximise the possibility of identifying the dead and ensuring that their families are informed. This project seeks to generate data that can enable the authorities to prioritise a systematic approach to the collection of information from both migrant bodies found in the EU and from the families of missing migrants seeking information about missing loved ones. The project will permit such policies to be driven by an understanding of what the families of dead and missing migrants seek from such an approach.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,ES/N01345X/1,,,,,,,,University of York,University of York,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15383058,,

Greenhouse gas metrics allow emissions of different gases to be reported in a common unit called CO2-equivalent. This enables comparisons of the efficiency of different farms and production systems and of alternative mitigation strategies across all gases. The standard metric is the 100 year global warming potential (GWP), but alternative metrics have been proposed and could result in very different CO2-equivalent emissions, particularly for CH4. While significant effort has been made to reduce uncertainties in emissions estimates of individual gases, little effort has been spent on evaluating the implications of alternative metrics on overall agricultural emissions profiles and mitigation strategies. Here we assess, for a selection of New Zealand dairy farms, the effect of two alternative metrics (100 yr GWP and global temperature change potentials, GTP) on farm-scale emissions and apparent efficiency and cost effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies. We find that alternative metrics significantly change the balance between CH4 and N2O; in some cases, alternative metrics even determine whether a specific management option would reduce or increase net farm-level emissions or emissions intensity. However, the relative ranking of different farms by profitability or emissions intensity, and the ranking of the most cost-effective mitigation options for each farm, are relatively unaffected by the metric.

This has become a serious environmental issue, as Goa is a global tourist destination. The present work aims at identifying the source oil of the tar balls that consistently depositing along the Goa coast using multi-marker fingerprint technique. In this context, the tar ball samples collected in May 2013 from 9 beaches of Goa coast and crude oils from different oil fields and grounded ship were subject to multi-marker analyses such as n-alkanes, pentacyclic terpanes, regular steranes, compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA) and principle component analysis (PCA). The n-alkane weathering index shows that samples have been weathered to various degrees, and the status of weathering is moderate. Since the international tanker route passes closer to the west coast of India (WCI), it is generally presumed that tanker wash is the source of the tar balls. We found that 2010/2011 tar balls are as tanker wash, but the present study demonstrates that the Bombay High (BH) oil fields can also contribute to oil contamination (tar balls) along approximate to 650 km stretch of the WCI, running from Gujarat in the north to Goa in the south. The simulated trajectories show that all the particles released in April traveled in the southeast direction, and by May, they reached the Goa coast with the influence of circulation of Indian monsoon system.

Its evolution can be broadly represented by the Proto-, Paleo-, and Neo-Tethys oceans, formed in the Early Paleozoic, Late Paleozoic, and Mesozoic, respectively. The final oceanic closure in the Cenozoic resulted in formation of the Alps, the Turkish-Iranian Plateau, and the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau, representing the development of elevated topography within the tropical-to-subtropical climate belts. The Proto-Tethys formed by the first rifting of the northern Gondwana margin at ca. 500Ma, and the blocks drifted northward and collided with Tarim and North China, and formed the Proto-Tethyan orogeny at ca. 440 similar to 420Ma, with a wide Longmucuo-Shuanghu ocean located to the south. This scenario is comparable with the Appalachian-Caledonian orogeny between the Gondwana-derived Avalonian terrane and Laurentia and Baltic. Northward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys along the LongmucuoShuanghu trench made opening of the previously closed Kuangxiwa-Anemaqen Ocean at ca. 380Ma and spreading of the Jingshajiang-Ailaoshan Ocean as a back-arc basin. During the Late Paleozoic, the western Paleo-Tethys (Rheic Ocean) was manifested by collision of Africa with Europe along the Variscan orogenic belt at 360 similar to 330Ma; whereas in the east, the Paleo-Tethyan oceans among the North China, South China, and Indochina closed simultaneously at ca. 250Ma, with formation of the Cathaysian continent. Together with Laurasia to the north, Gondwana to the south, and the Variscan orogen to the west, a residual Paleo-Tethys ocean was trapped, and the final eustatic regression took place in the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic. Meanwhile, the northern Gondwanan margin resumed rifting with a series of blocks to form the Neo-Tethyan Ocean, which was subsequently closed in the Cenozoic. The formation of the Chinese continent is variably contributed by the Proto-, Paleo-, and Neo-Tethyan orogenies, and formed the world well-known Tethyan metallogenic province. The extensive and long-lived passive margin sedimentation in tropical-to-subtropical climates helped form tremendous reserves of oil and gas. Tethyan paleogeography and paleotopography have influenced global climate and environmental change from deep time to the present. Especially, the oceanic subductions of the Proto-Tethy, Paleo-Tethys and Neo-Tethys match well with the transition of the Earth climate from the greenhouse to the icehouse in the Phanerozoic. The above synthesis indicates that the Tethyan evolution is characterized by northward drift of the rifted continental blocks from Gondwana, and subsequently collision with Eurasia continuously throughout Phanerozoic time. Such northward drifting and subduction strongly suggests that the slab pull is a dominant geodynamic force of plate movement, and the role of mantle plume as a driving force needs further investigation.",,,,,,,,,159,93,0,0,5,0,212,,,1000-0569,2095-8927,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, State Key Lab Lithospher Evolut, Beijing 100029, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China",,,,2020-09-07,WOS:000562482600001,,

Using geographic information techniques, we analyzed aerial photography of five areas in the humid tropics of northeastern Queensland, Australia, taken in the 1950s and 2008, to determine if changes in rain forest extent match those reported for the Australian monsoon tropics using similar techniques. Mapping of the 1950s aerial photography showed that of the combined study area (64,430 ha), 63% was classified as eucalypt forests/woodland and 37% as rain forest. Our mapping revealed that although most boundaries remained stable, there was a net increase of 732 ha of the original rain forest area over the study period, and negligible conversion of rain forest to eucalypt forest/woodland. Statistical modeling, controlling for spatial autocorrelation, indicated distance from preexisting rain forest as the strongest determinant of rain forest expansion. Margin extension had a mean rate across the five sites of 0.6 m per decade. Expansion was greater in tall open forest types but also occurred in shorter, more flammable woodland vegetation types. No correlations were detected with other local variables (aspect, elevation, geology, topography, drainage). Using a geographically weighted mean rate of rain forest margin extension across the whole region, we predict that over 25% of tall open forest (a forest type of high conservation significance) would still remain after 2000 years of rain forest expansion. This slow replacement is due to the convoluted nature of the rain forest boundary and the irregular shape of the tall open forest patches. Our analyses point to the increased concentration of atmospheric CO2 as the most likely global driver of indiscriminate rain forest expansion occurring in northeastern Australia, by increasing tree growth and thereby overriding the effects of fire disturbance.",,,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,28,0,35,,,2045-7758,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tasmania, Sch Plant Sci, Hobart, Tas 7005, AustraliaS Dakota State Univ, Geog Informat Sci Ctr Excellence, Brookings, SD 57007 USAWet Trop Management Author, Cairns, Qld 4870, AustraliaQueensland Herbarium, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",Wet Trop Management AuthorQueensland Herbarium,,,2012-01-01,WOS:000312442000003,22408724,

Results showed that watering process benefits the brine-ice separation through centrifugation and therefore the ice purity can be enhanced. To ameliorate ice product purity, increasing the mass proportion of watering raw seawater is a more feasible method than watering pure water. The desalination effect of adding raw seawater would be better in summer than in winter when other parameters constant. Comparing with combined freezing, gravity-induced and centrifugal desalination (FGCD) method, FWCD is a continuous process that can accelerate the desalination duration, and more ice with the same purity can be yielded within the salt removal efficiency range of FWCD method.

Even though CO2 could be miscible with oil in regions nearby injection wells, the miscibility could be lost in deep reservoirs because of low pressure and the dispersion effect. Reducing the CO2-oil miscibility pressure can enlarge the miscible zone, particularly when the reservoir pressure is less than the needed minimum miscible pressure (MMP). Furthermore, adding intermediate hydrocarbons in the CO2-oil system can also lower the interfacial tension (IFT). In this study, we used dead crude oil from the H Block in the X oilfield to study the IFT and the MMP changes with different hydrocarbon agents. The hydrocarbon agents, including alkanes, alcohols, oil-soluble surfactants, and petroleum ethers, were mixed with the crude oil samples from the H Block, and their performances on reducing CO2-oil IFT and CO2-oil MMP were determined. Experimental results show that the CO2-oil MMP could be reduced by 6.19 MPa or 12.17% with petroleum ether in the boiling range of 30-60 degrees C.

The understanding of the fate and transport of PHCs in these regions is therefore necessary to develop strategies for remediation. To quantify the sorption rates of PHCs in (semi)-arid coastal soil environments, we conducted a series of controlled laboratory batch experiments under variable temperature and salinity conditions. The soil samples were collected from the eastern coast of Qatar which is near the two largest off-shore oil and natural gas fields of the country (North Gas and Al-Shaheen Oil Fields), and the volatile benzene and naphthalene were used as PHCs. The characterization of soil samples showed sand classification with the texture class of sabkha and saline beach sandy soils with calcite as potential dominant mineral. The concentrations of dissolved chloride and sodium were found to be high (> 400 mg L-1) with a chloride-to-sodium ratio of about 1.7. The results of sorption experiments showed that the rates of naphthalene sorption were more than for benzene, where the initial aqueous concentrations of benzene and naphthalene were reduced at equilibrium due to sorption by about 14-25% and 65-79%, respectively. This difference was attributed mainly to the organic carbon-water partitioning coefficient which is higher for naphthalene. The sorption rate experiments showed that sorption was stronger for benzene under higher salinity and lower temperature conditions. The sorption of naphthalene was not affected by the change in salinity but increased by 18% when the temperature decreased from 35 to 5 degrees C.

To utilize the existing BOG compressor for fuel production, the liquefaction was conducted by the Joule Thomson UT) cycle, which can use the pressurized BOG as a working fluid. For the comparison of the fuel supply system and its variations with BOG liquefaction, they are optimized with respect to total annual cost (TAC) as the objective function. With an LNG price of 5 USD/MMBtu, the optimization results show that the use of BOG liquefiers on LNG vessels reduces the TAC by at least 9.4% compared to the high pressure fuel supply system. The use of a liquid turbine in the liquefaction configurations also resulted in 2.4% savings in TAC compared to the JT cycle based process. However, a sensitivity analysis with different LNG prices indicates that the liquefaction systems are not economical compared to the fuel supply system when the LNG price is lower than 4 USD/MMBtu.

In view of the inherent hazardous properties of LNG, LNG-fueled vessels are extremely complex and dangerous when fueling. It is necessary to study the risk factors and the intrinsic relationship among the factors in the process of fueling operation, and to simulate the process risk of the LNG-fueled vessel. During the process of fueling of LNG-fueled vessel, the LNG-fueled vessel interacts with energy and information every phase with the surrounding environment. This paper analyzed the impact of the three interactions between the fueling operation process, ship factors and environmental factors on the risk of fueling operation, and then established a complete causal system for LNG-fueled vessels operation. By analyzing the boundary conditions of the system, the relationship between factors was established using system dynamics method. Based on the catastrophe theory(CA), the dynamics model for LNG fueling is proposed to understand the system's risk mutation phenomenon via the tools of System Dynamics(SD). Combined with the simulation results of the case analysis, the risk evolution mode of the LNG-fueled vessel during the LNG fueling process is obtained and put forward constructive opinions for improving the fueling safety of the LNG-fueled vessel.

Two phases of intensive campaigns were conducted during February-April and June-July of 2017 at a rural coastal site and in open oil fields of the Yellow River Delta region, northern China. C-1-C-5 alkyl nitrates showed higher concentration levels in summer than in winter-spring (p < 0.01), whilst their parent hydrocarbons showed an opposite seasonal variation pattern. The C-3-C-5 RONO2 levels in the oil fields were significantly higher than those in the ambient rural air. Alkyl nitrates showed well-defined diurnal variations, elucidating the effects of in-situ photochemical production and regional transport of aged polluted plumes. Backward trajectory analysis and fire maps revealed the significant contribution of biomass burning to the observed alkyl nitrates and hydrocarbons. A simplified sequential reaction model and an observation-based chemical box model were deployed to diagnose the formation mechanisms of C-1-C-5 RONO2. The C-3-C-5 RONO2 were mainly produced from the photochemical oxidation of their parent hydrocarbons (i.e., C-3-C-5 alkanes), whilst C-1-C-2 RONO2 compounds have additional sources. In addition to parent hydrocarbons, longer alkanes with >4 carbon atoms were also important precursors of alkyl nitrates in the oil fields. This study demonstrates the significant effects of oil field emissions and biomass burning on the volatile organic compounds and alkyl nitrate formation, and provides scientific support for the formulation of control strategies against photochemical air pollution in the Yellow River Delta region.

Large emissions and transport of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) may contribute to regional ozone (03) and particulate matter (PM) pollution; however, the concentrations and sources of ambient NMHCs have not yet been investigated in Ningbo. In this study, ambient NMHCs were measured at two residential (SZ and CX) and two industrial (ZH and BL) sites and one suburban (XS) site over ten consecutive days in each season (10-20 December 2012 in winter, 14-23 April 2013 in spring, 15-24 July 2013 in summer, 22-31 October 2013, in autumn). A positive matrix factorization (PMF) model using multiple site data was deployed to explore the source contributions and their spatial and seasonal characteristics. The measurement results showed obvious seasonal variations in ambient NMHC concentrations (ranging from 17.89-28.48 ppbv); chemical compositions were similar among the five sampling sites. PMF analysis showed that the petrochemical industry was the largest contributor (an average of 35.64%) to ambient NMHCs, while contributions of smaller sources (i.e., chemical and paint industries [1434%], fuel and tank evaporation [16.02%], and residential solvent usage [7.24%]) showed spatial variations. Liquefied petroleum gas and fuel and tank evaporation contributed more in summer and autumn, while the contribution of the chemical and paint industries was greater in spring and winter. An evaluation of the ozone formation potential and secondary organic aerosol potential suggested that petrochemical and solvent-related sources were key parameters in mitigation of secondary pollutant formation. Seasonal variations in source contributions should be considered when formulating an effective NMHC abatement strategy.

More specifically, it deals with the practical problems (and possible solutions) associated with mapping settlements, which is a more difficult operation than the mapping of shipwrecks. Firstly, the paper discusses the scientific value of submerged settlements in relation to those accessible on land, for example the good conditions for the preservation of organic artefacts, environmental data, aDNA etc. Furthermore, social anthropological data suggest that the groups we find evidence of along the highly productive prehistoric marine coast lines may well have differed from inland groups who were unable to extend their territories out to the coast. Secondly, it outlines some possible methodological solutions to our present problem of cost-effective site mapping, all based on acoustics. Finally, the paper discusses strategic and legislative perspectives associated with the new maritime archaeological focus on settlements and new technological possibilities in this respect.

It is the intention that several of the studentships will be cross-disciplinary, between Engineering and Chemistry, and between Computing Science and Geograpy.Our areas of increased priority are in:(1) Materials & Chemical Engineering, which links a.o. to the EPSRC research areas of Water Engineering, Carbon Capture and Storage, Fuel Cell Technologies, Catalysis, and Materials Engineering - Composites(2) Environmental & Industrial Fluid Mechanics, which links a.o. to the EPSRC research area Coastal & Waterway Engineering(3) Digital Economy which links a.o. to EPSRC areas Energy Efficiency (End User Energy Demand), Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Natural Language Processing, and Information Systems.Doctoral research opportunities are advertised on FindAPhD and via our PhD vacancies link on the Graduate School website www.abdn.ac.uk/cops/graduate. Students are provided with an extensive range of development opportunities to support them in developing their skills and competencies, and build their CV to succeed in an increasingly competitive global environment. Additionally, a comprehensive programme of activities is provided to support students to deliver societal and economic impact in a global environment - for example in enterprise, entrepreneurship, creativity and commercialisation, teaching and self-management. A researcher-led initiative fund allows students to propose their own ideas for cross-disciplinary training. A progressive approach to skills development uses the opportunities offered by public engagement. Students are assigned career mentors to focus on career aspirations and planning, who will come from a range of backgrounds and disciplines including industry partners and collaborators. All staff in the College of Physical Sciences will be notified as soon as the final allocation has been announced by EPSRC, and asked to produce short PhD project descriptions with a deadline of mid Nov, with a specific mention of our priority areas and the priority that will be given to early career staff and new appointees. A subset of these projects (selected by Heads of School and Head of Graduate School) will be advertised (by mid Dec) to prospective students as having potentially DTP funding associated with them. This set will be substantially larger than the number of funded places available, and will also be advertised to international students who may have other sources of funding. The set will provide a good coverage of the identified research priority areas. Applicants will be made aware that funding may be available (using the DTP conditions) on a competitive basis. Applicants will need to apply by 1 March. For each project topic, a panel will select the best candidate. The students' applications will be used for shortlisting, and an interview used for shortlisted candidates. The best eligible candidates across topics will be offered funding, whilst taking into account the intended distribution of funding across priority areas. If the first student in a particular area does not accept their funding, it is offered to the second choice (if outstanding) and so on. Funding decisions will be made by end of April. This process will be repeated in 2016.To be eligible applicants must normally hold or have an expectation of a first class degree (the award can be made conditionally on achieving that outcome) or a 2:1 degree and an MSc with commendation or distinction.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/N509814/1,,,,,,,,University of Aberdeen,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15316954,,

Average mineral soil C in Douglas-fir stands ranged from 102 Mg/ha to 177 Mg/ha in Puget Sound and Washington Cascades provinces, respectively. Soil N ranged from 3708 kg/ha in Puget Sound province to 9268 kg/ha in the Washington Cascade province. Western hemlock data were analyzed in three provinces (Washington Cascades, coastal Washington, and coastal Oregon). Average mineral soil C in western hemlock stands ranged from 241 Mg/ha in the Washington Cascades to 309 Mg/ha in coastal Washington and was higher than Douglas-fir mineral soil C. Western hemlock mineral soil N was also higher than Douglas-fir mineral soil N ranging from 10 495 kg/ha in the Washington Cascades to 15 216 kg/ha in coastal Oregon. Forest floor C and N contents were also higher in western hemlock than Douglas-fir stands. Nonlinear regression analysis revealed a weak positive relationship between site index and total mineral soil C in Douglas-fir (r2 = 0.19). A similar relationship was observed between Douglas-fir site index and total soil N (r2 = 0.19). Relationships were weak because of the large variability in mineral soil C and N within as well as across provinces. Maximum Douglas-fir site indexes occurred across a broad plateau of mineral soil and forest floor C/N ratios ranging from 15-25 and 35-45, respectively. Minimum site indexes also occurred in these C/N ranges. No increase in Douglas-fir productivity occurred above mineral soil C levels of 125 Mg/ha.

A single mixed refrigerant (SMR) liquefaction process was chosen for this study because of its simplicity and compactness. In addition, it is considered the most promising process for the liquefied natural gas (LNG) floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit. The SMR process was optimized using a modified coordinate descent methodology, which resulted in 13.6% energy savings. Subsequently, an interface between commercial software Aspen Hysys (R) and MS-Excel VBA was carried out to study the effects of RH. The results showed that RH has pronounced effects on the performance of the LNG cycle by affecting the enthalpy balance around the air coolers, which ultimately affects the overall compression power, LNG exchanger performance, and other design and operational parameters. Furthermore, when the RH was increased from 0% to 95%, the UA value (product of overall heat transfer coefficient and heat transfer area) of the air coolers and the overall compression power decreased and increased linearly, respectively. Moreover, the heat transfer coefficient of the LNG cryogenic exchanger increased as a 4th order polynomial function in terms of the log-mean enthalpy difference. The results can provide insight into the selection of the appropriate design and operational parameters for the LNG plants associated with the regions of low or high relative humidity.

The installation of Pipe-in-Pipe (PIP) flowline in deep water, by either the S-Lay method or J-Lay method, can present real challenges due to the effect of locked-in compressive loads on the inner pipe, due to gravity during installation. The effect of this compressive load is to reduce the ultimate loading capacity of the inner pipe during operation, when temperature and pressure are applied. One such way to overcome this locked-in compressive load, is to apply tension on the inner pipe during installation on the lay barge, and insert a device called 'Loadshare' to distribute the load between the inner and outer pipe. The objective of this paper is to present the results of a finite element study, to investigate the effects of inserting the Loadshare(s) during installation of a PIP system. A finite element model has been created, using ABAQUS, to simulate the laying process with the inclusion of Loadshares. The model is used to determine the shear force imposed on the Loadshare, and the lock-in axial load inside the pipeline prior to operational start-up of the pipeline. Also, the relaxation of the Loadshare tension as the pipeline is lowered, is investigated. The model, load steps and results are presented in this paper. This work is part of a larger GoM project that aims at bridging technology gaps for increasing the boundaries of what is possible with PIP designs, for extra high pressure and high temperature (XHPHT) applications in the GoM region.

However, very little work has been conducted on how spilled oil affects fish sperm and there is no related knowledge concerning oil dispersing agents. The objective of our study was to determine sperm performance of a teleost fish under direct exposure to different concentrations of WAF (water accommodated fraction) and CEWAF (chemically enhanced water accommodated fraction). Capelin sperm motility, swimming behaviour, and sperm fertilization ability were evaluated in a scenario of an oil spill untreated (WAF) and treated (CEWAF) with the dispersant Corexit((R)) EC9500A. Sperm fertilizing ability was lower when exposed to CEWAF concentrations of 16.1 x 10(3) mu g/L total petroleum hydrocarbons and 47.9 mu g/L PAH, and when exposed to the dispersant alone. The mechanism responsible for this reduced fertilizing ability is not clear. However, it is not related to the percentage of motile sperm or sperm swimming behaviour, as these were unaffected. WAF did not alter sperm swimming characteristics nor the fertilizing ability. We suggest the dispersant rather than the dispersed oil is responsible for the decrease in the sperm fertilizing ability and hypothesize that the surfactants present in the dispersant affect sperm membrane functionality.

Recent events have highlighted the importance of wireless communications with such environments. A prominent example is the July 2018 rescue of a soccer team from the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in Thailand after they had been trapped underground for over two weeks. Such RF-denied environments are fundamentally produced by the short skin depth of electromagnetic waves within conductive media such as earth or seawater, which results in high attenuation. Fortunately, the skin depth increases as the frequency decreases, so extremely low frequency (ELF) radio waves in the kHz range can penetrate long distances in nominally RF-denied environments. For example, the skin depth in sea water is 7.1 m at 1 kHz, which would allow undersea communications to depths of about 30 m with reasonable transmit power levels if one could effectively couple ELF radio waves into the medium. However, conventional antennas are extremely large and impossible to deploy in this frequency range, while electrically-short antennas have very poor power efficiency. This project seeks to solve this fundamental problem by adopting a radically new approach to ELF antennas that is based on the mechanical motion of permanent magnets. The proposed research will have a broad impact on the availability of bidirectional wireless communications in RF-denied environments. Specifically, it will enable low-data-rate wireless links to be established using portable, robust, low-power, and low-cost devices. Such links are expected to have a multitude of applications in fields such as sensing and networking in underwater or underground environments, near-surface geophysics, atmospheric science, search and rescue operations, mining, and oil and gas exploration. The availability of portable low-power ELF transceivers would immediately enable communications within RF-denied environments by enabling bidirectional low-data-rate wireless links with the surface. While miniaturized and highly-sensitive ELF receivers are available, ELF transmitters (typically dipole or loop antennas) are the key obstacles for realizing such links since they are physically large and power-hungry. Thus, this project focuses on miniaturized and power-efficient ELF transmitters that enable bidirectional communications over short- and medium-range (up to about 1 km) wireless links in conductive media. In particular, the proposed research will explore a fundamentally new all-mechanical approach to ELF transmitter design that has the potential to enable efficient use of this region of the EM spectrum.

This study comparatively evaluated on a life cycle basis the economic and environmental cost-benefits of LNG/NG for self-generation of power with those of the grid electricity supply. The analysis conducted showed that for desalination plant sizes of 75-570 ML/day, the LNG-based onsite power generation option is 20-30% more economical than the alternative connection to the grid. However, the life cycle cost (LCC) of the LNG-based onsite power generation system is from 43% to up to 86% higher than the NG-based counterpart for desalination plant sizes that increase progressively from 10 to 570 ML/day. A sensitivity analysis conducted on two conceptual mid-range capacity seawater desalination plants showed that variations in the electric tariff rate, fuel cost, plant efficiency, and economic parameters affect the LCC of various power supply options.

J,,,,,,,,,"SANDLER, DALE P",,Gulf Longitudinal Follow-up (GuLF) Study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 1800,1800,"The Gulf Long-term Follow-up Study (GuLF STUDY, www.gulfstudy.nih.gov) was initiated in response to the April 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) drilling rig and resulting oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest marine oil spill in U.S. history. A total of 32,608 oil spill response and clean-up workers completed a telephone enrollment questionnaire between 2011-2013. Over 11,000 participants from Gulf states completed a home visit that included collection of biospecimens and collection of anthropometric and lung function measurements. A subset of 2,969 participants completed repeated questionnaires to assess mental health trajectories over 4 visits between 2013-2016. A subset of 3,403 participants completed a clinical exam (2014-2016) that included additional lung function measurement, assessment of neurological function, and biological sample collection. Participants are followed over time via linkage to cancer and mortality records.Follow-up data were collected for 21,256 participants between 2013-2016. A second follow-up interview cycle began in 2018 and is nearing completion. In addition to updating previously collected questionnaire data, the new interview adds questions about fertility and reproductive health. There are also new questions on sleep, metabolic health, and social factors to enable studies of health disparities. As part of this interview, we are attempting to validate self-reported health endpoints by collecting data on medications or treatments that support the diagnosis (e.g. use of insulin or oral agents by diabetics) and requesting medical records. A unique aspect of this work is the extensive characterization of oil spill exposures. We used questionnaires and measurement data to develop an ordinal job-exposure matrix (JEM) for total hydrocarbons (THC) as a composite marker of oil spill exposures. We also developed ordinal measures for exposure to dispersants and particulates from burning oil. We used questionnaire data to identify groups of jobs/tasks with likely similar exposures and used the measurement data from monitoring that took place during the clean-up to characterize the exposures in those jobs. Exposures were found to vary by location, task, and time in relation to the capping of the well, among other factors. Statistical methods were developed and/or evaluated to identify the least biased way to deal with values below the LOD and other censoring. Recently published or in press papers describe newer metrics for characterizing dermal exposures to oil and oil related products (Gorman et al, 2019); inhalation exposures to six oil-related compounds on the four rig vessels that responded to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (Huynh , et al., in press); and particulate matter exposure from the in situ burning of oil and gas (Pratt et al., in press). A paper describing a new quantitative job-exposure matrix to characterize time-weighted and cumulated exposures to total hydrocarbons and individual BTEX chemicals is being finalized as are papers that detail the statistical methods underpinning this work. Some of these new measures are already being evaluated in relation to specific health effects. Short- and long-term mental health effects continue to be a concern. A recent analysis showed that mental health symptoms were increased with increasing number of disaster experiences, with greater levels of depression and PTSD-like symptoms among persons who experienced both disruption due to Hurricane Katrina and worked on oil spill clean-up (Lowe et al. 2019). Current analyses are evaluating the persistence of mental health symptoms such as depression and anxiety as well as the association between oil spill exposures and various patterns of mental health trajectories. We recently developed indices of cumulative disaster burden for the cohort and have submitted a paper that describes the impact of experiencing multiple weather-related disasters and losses on mental health in the cohort.Pulmonary function testing was done at the GuLF STUDY home exams and again, for a subset, during a clinical exam 2 years later. A recently published paper showed that while workers with the highest levels of exposure to oil spill chemicals had reduced lung function at the time of the home visit (1-3 years after the spill), these deficits were no long apparent at the clinical exam (4-6 years after the spill (Lawrence, et al., 2020). We studied risk of cardiovascular disease over five-years of follow-up in relation to levels of exposure to total hydrocarbons and found a significant increase in risk (Hazard Ratio = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.95), equaling 10 excess cases per 1,000 workers for incident heart attack at the highest versus lowest level of exposure (Strelitz et al., 2019a). We also reported that living in proximity to the oil spill (versus living further away) and duration of oil spill cleanup work were associated with increased risk of incident self-reported and fatal MI (Strelitz et al., 2019b). These associations will be explored in greater detail in a proposed doctoral dissertation with will consider newer exposure metrics and longer cohort follow-up.Although not an oil spill chemical, per se, blood levels of styrene had been found to be higher among Gulf coast residents participating in this study compared to levels from a U.S. population sample. Styrene, at occupational exposure levels, is a neurotoxin. We investigated the potential link between population-level styrene exposures and neurological symptoms and function. Two exposure measures were used: blood levels of styrene, and ambient exposures estimated using an EPA national air toxics database linked to the residences of GuLF STUDY participants. Styrene was suggestively associated with both symptoms and several specific tests of neurological function (Werder et al., 2018; Werder et al. 2019a). A related paper sought to identify determinants of environmental styrene exposer in Gulf State residents (Werder et al., 2019b). We also considered contemporaneous exposure to metals in relation neurologic symptoms, finding that associations with blood levels of metals and neurological symptoms were modified by selenium. Blood levels of BTEX chemicals were also associated with the reporting of neurological symptoms. These exposures reflected current exposures rather than exposures from the oil spill given the short half lives of these chemicals (Werder et al., 2019c). We also reported suggestive evidence of associations of blood BTEXS and heavy metals with selected biomarkers of liver injury and systemic inflammation (Werder et al, 2020). A new line of work considers the impact of socioeconomic disadvantage in relation to various health outcomes in this cohort. We recently reported that neighborhood disadvantage, as measured by the Area Deprivation Index was associated with increased obesity and diabetes risk both cross-sectionally and longitudinally (Hu et al., 2020 in press). Additional analyses of biomarkers of kidney and liver dysfunction in relation to oil spill exposures are underway. An epigenome wide study of methylation in blood is being carried out in a sample of participants selected based on total hydrocarbon and burning exposure levels. Laboratory work is complete as is preprocessing and cleaning of the data. This work is designed to identify a potential epigenetic signature for oil-spill exposures and to determine if oil spill exposures are associated with epigenetic-based measures of age acceleration (epigenetic clocks) as well as specific health outcomes such as reduced lung function.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,10252592; 1ZIAES102945-11; ZIAES102945,,,,,,,,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES,,,,2023-12-14,GRANTS:15558207,,

These changes in the amount of O-2 are large enough to have led to changes in atmospheric mass, which may alter the radiative budget of the atmosphere, leading to this mechanism being invoked to explain discrepancies between climate model simulations and proxy reconstructions of past climates. Here, we present the first fully 3-D numerical model simulations to investigate the climate impacts of changes in O2 under different climate states using the coupled atmosphere-ocean Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 3 (HadGEM3-AO) and Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3 (HadCM3-BL) models. We show that simulations with an increase in O-2 content result in increased global-mean surface air temperature under conditions of a pre-industrial Holocene climate state, in agreement with idealised 1-D and 2-D modelling studies. We demonstrate the mechanism behind the warming is complex and involves a trade-off between a number of factors. Increasing atmospheric O-2 leads to a reduction in incident shortwave radiation at the Earth's surface due to Rayleigh scattering, a cooling effect. However, there is a competing warming effect due to an increase in the pressure broadening of greenhouse gas absorption lines and dynamical feedbacks, which alter the meridional heat transport of the ocean, warming polar regions and cooling tropical regions. Case studies from past climates are investigated using HadCM3-BL and show that, in the warmest climate states in the Maastrichtian (72.1-66.0 Ma), increasing oxygen may lead to a temperature decrease, as the equilibrium climate sensitivity is lower. For the Asselian (298.9-295.0 Ma), increasing oxygen content leads to a warmer global-mean surface temperature and reduced carbon storage on land, suggesting that high oxygen content may have been a contributing factor in preventing a Snowball Earth during this period of the early Permian. These climate model simulations reconcile the surface temperature response to oxygen content changes across the hierarchy of model complexity and highlight the broad range of Earth system feedbacks that need to be accounted for when considering the climate response to changes in atmospheric oxygen content.",,,,,,,,,13,3,0,0,3,0,17,,,1814-9324,1814-9332,,,,,,,,,,"Ctr Atmospher Sci, Dept Chem, Cambridge, EnglandNatl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Dept Chem, Cambridge, EnglandUniv Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England",,,,2019-08-13,WOS:000478753500001,,

However, after long-term treatment with FSWI, the microenvironment of the soil has been found to be affected by the growth of crops, which will directly influence the balance of soil carbon emissions. In this study, the characteristics of soil respiration in a typical saline field (planted with cotton) under four treatments (FSWI in Winter with plastic mulching, FSWI + Mulch; FSWI in Winter without plastic mulching, FSWI; plastic mulching in Spring without FSWI, mulch; no plastic mulching and no FSWI, CK) were investigated between June and November from 2015 to 2016. The results suggested that the soil surface temperature was an important factor that affected the soil respiration rate in each treatment during the growth period of cotton. FSWI + Mulch can reduce the soil surface salinity to 0.4% during the seedling stage, which increased the survival rate and the abundance of bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes in the cotton field and subsequently increased soil respiration.

The various types of device were assessed, on the basis of a functional unit of 1 kWh of electricity delivered to the grid. The impact categories investigated were based on the ILCD recommendations. The life cycle models were set up using detailed technical information on the components and structure of around 180 ocean energy devices from an in-house database.The design of ocean energy devices still varies considerably, and their weight ranges from 190 to 1270 t, depending on device type. Environmental impacts are closely linked to material inputs and are caused mainly by mooring and foundations and structural components, while impacts from assembly, installation and use are insignificant for all device types. Total greenhouse gas emissions of ocean energy devices range from about 15 to 105 g CO2-eq. kWh(-1). Average global warming potential for all device types is 53 +/- 29 g CO2-eq. kWh(-1).

Despite several assessments, the current knowledge on NETs is still diffuse and incomplete, but also growing fast. Here, we synthesize a comprehensive body of NETs literature, using scientometric tools and performing an in-depth assessment of the quantitative and qualitative evidence therein. We clarify the role of NETs in climate change mitigation scenarios, their ethical implications, as well as the challenges involved in bringing the various NETs to the market and scaling them up in time. There are six major findings arising from our assessment: first, keeping warming below 1.5 degrees C requires the large-scale deployment of NETs, but this dependency can still be kept to a minimum for the 2 degrees C warming limit. Second, accounting for economic and biophysical limits, we identify relevant potentials for all NETs except ocean fertilization. Third, any single NET is unlikely to sustainably achieve the large NETs deployment observed in many 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C mitigation scenarios. Yet, portfolios of multiple NETs, each deployed at modest scales, could be invaluable for reaching the climate goals. Fourth, a substantial gap exists between the upscaling and rapid diffusion of NETs implied in scenarios and progress in actual innovation and deployment. If NETs are required at the scales currently discussed, the resulting urgency of implementation is currently neither reflected in science nor policy. Fifth, NETs face severe barriers to implementation and are only weakly incentivized so far. Finally, we identify distinct ethical discourses relevant for NETs, but highlight the need to root them firmly in the available evidence in order to render such discussions relevant in practice.",,,,,,,,,457,8,0,0,91,0,487,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15,EUREF Campus 19, D-10829 Berlin, GermanyUniv Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, EnglandTech Univ Berlin, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, GermanyUniv Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Inst Geol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, GermanyPotsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, GermanyUniv Wisconsin, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, 1225 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USAIIASA, ENE Program, Laxenburg, AustriaETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, SwitzerlandUniv Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, 23 St Machar Dr, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, ScotlandColorado Sch Mines, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USAUniv Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, EnglandImperial Coll London, Grantham Inst, Prince Consort Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England",Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change,,,2018-06-01,WOS:000432813100001,,

Extensive laboratory studies in the past two decades have proposed several pore-scale mechanisms of oil displacement during LSW flooding, which are still open for discussion. However, the capability of reservoir simulators to model accurately this process is very limited. This paper provides a critical review of the state of the art in research and field applications of LSW. The focus is on a widely agreed mechanism that is the wettability alteration from preferential oil wetness to water wetness of formation rock surfaces. Ion exchange and geochemical reactions have been experimentally found to be important in oil mobilization due to enhanced water spreading at low salinity. To evaluate the significance of this surface wetting mechanism, a comprehensive ion exchange model with geochemical processes has been developed and coupled to the multi-phase multi-component flow equations in an equation-of-state compositional simulator. This new model captures most of the important physical and chemical phenomena that occur in LSW, including intra-aqueous reactions, mineral dissolution/precipitation, ion exchange and wettability alteration.The proposed LSW model is tested using the low-salinity core-flood experiments reported by Fjelde et al. (2012) for a North Sea reservoir and the low-salinity and high-salinity heterogeneous core-flood experiments by Rivet (2009) for a Texas reservoir. Excellent agreements between the model and the experiments in terms of effluent ion concentrations, effluent pH, and oil recovery were achieved. In addition, the model was also proved to be highly comparable with the ion-exchange model of the geochemistry software PHREEQC for both low salinity and high salinity (Appelo, 1994). Important observations in laboratory and field tests such as a local pH increase, a decrease in divalent effluent concentration, mineralogy contributions, and the influence of connate water and injected brine compositions can be reproduced with the proposed LSW model. Built in a robust reservoir simulator, it serves as a powerful tool for LSW design and the interpretation of process performance in field tests.Although the advantages of LSW have been reported, none of the systematic approaches has addressed the issues of modeling and predicting LSW field-scale performance. The new modeling approach introduced in this research can effectively capture the critical effects of geology in the LSW process. This integrated modeling approach involves the use of geological software, a reservoir simulator, and a robust optimizer in a closed loop for sensitivity analysis, history matching, optimization, and uncertainty assessment. The field-scale benefits of secondary and tertiary LSW are then addressed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

More importantly, another advantage of LSW is that it can be integrated with other EOR methods (in hybrid LSW processes), i.e. chemical or miscible gas flooding. The merits of combining LSW with CO2 injection is investigated in this paper, and a novel EOR method, Low Salinity Water Alternating CO2 (CO2 LSWAG), is proposed. CO2 LSWAG injection promotes the synergy of the mechanisms underlying these methods which further enhances oil recovery and overcomes the late production problems frequently encountered in conventional WAG. CO2 LSWAG has been evaluated in both one-dimensional and full-field scale with positive results compared with conventional high salinity WAG.To investigate the advantages of CO2 LSWAG, a comprehensive ion exchange model associated with geochemical processes has been implemented and coupled to the multi-phase multi-component flow equations in an equation-of-state compositional simulator. 1D simulation of different CO2 LSWAG schemes are first conducted to understand the combined effects of solubility of CO2 in brine, dissolution of carbonate minerals, ion exchange, and wettability alteration. CO2 LSWAG performance is then evaluated on a field scale through an integrated workflow that includes geological modeling, multi-phase multi component reservoir flow modeling and process optimization. The simulation results indicate that CO2 LSWAG has the highest oil recovery compared to conventional high salinity waterflood, high salinity WAG, continuous CO2 flooding, and low salinity waterflood. A number of geological realizations are generated to assess the geological uncertainty effect, in particular clay distribution uncertainties, on CO2 LSWAG efficiency. CO2 LSWAG injection strategies are optimized by identifying key WAG parameters. Finally, CO2 LSWAG is evaluated in the full field scale for a North Sea reservoir and the simulation results shows that CO2 LSWAG yields about 4.5% incremental OOIP compared to the conventional high salinity WAG.The proposed workflow demonstrates the synergy between CO2 WAG and LSW. Built in a robust reservoir simulator, it serves as a powerful tool for screening, design, optimization, and uncertainty assessment of the process. CO2 LSWAG is a promising EOR technique as it not only combines the benefits of CO2 injection and low salinity water floods but also promotes the synergy between these processes through the interactions between geochemical reactions associated with CO2 injection, ion exchange process, and wettability alteration. This paper demonstrates the merits of this process through modeling, optimization and uncertainty assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, knowledge of such effects in hyper-arid regions is still scant. Two major oil spills occurred in the hyper-arid Arava Valley of Israel - one in 1975, and the second in 2014. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of the oil on the soil hydrophobicity and related physical properties. Additionally, decay in hydrophobicity over time was assessed by comparing these soil properties from the 1975 and 2014 contaminated sites. We hypothesized that the degradation of oil over time would cause a decrease in hydrophobicity during this 40-year time span. The study was implemented by on-site monitoring of the soil penetration resistance, water drop penetration time, critical surface tension, and hydraulic conductivity, as well as by laboratory measurements of drop contact angle and soil texture. All of these tests were conducted at the ground surface, at 5-cm, and 10-cm depths of the 1975 and 2014 contaminated sites, as well as for non-contaminated sites nearby. Despite the approximately 3.5 times smaller mean concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbon at the 1975 site (7800 mg/kg) compared to the 2014 site (26,400 mg/kg), the study results revealed a general similarity of hydrophobicity and related soil properties between them.

The test results for the two fully sunken objects showed rather different force profiles. The effect of BF on the caisson, at 1.27 MN, is much larger than that (0.086 MN) on the vessel due to the greater weight of the caisson, whereas the effect indices are almost identical. During separation from the surface water, the vessel was affected by the WC within the vessel as well as by BR and ST. Once fully salvaged, the lifting force of the vessel gradually reduced to 0.71 MN from the maximum of 138 MN, owing to WR. The maximum lifting forces of the vessel and the caisson correspond to two and one times the initial lifting forces of 0.69 MN and 9.41 MN, respectively. It was found that the salvage process of the vessel resulted in a more complicated lifting force history than that of the caisson, primarily because the vessel structure allowed WC and release.

In particular, some dispersants contain nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs), which can degrade to nonylphenol (NP), a known endocrine disruptor. Given the urgent need to generate toxicity data, we carried out a series of in vitro high-throughput assays on eight commercial dispersants. These assays focused on the estrogen and androgen receptors (ER and AR), but also included a larger battery of assays probing other biological pathways. Cytotoxicity in mammalian cells was also quantified. No activity was seen in any AR assay.

Most of the work focuses on the separate effects of fire or topography, and as a result, the spatial variability in the response of soil carbon flux to fire remains unclear. A two-year field experiment was conducted in the boreal forest of the DaXinganling Mountains to investigate the effects of topography (ridge and depression) and fire on soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes and to determine how the effects of fire vary with topography. The results showed that soil carbon flux to the atmosphere in this region was dominated by soil CO2 flux. Topography had significant effect on soil carbon fluxes, with higher soil CO2 emissions and CH4 uptakes on the ridge than in the depression, whether burned or not, and these topographical differences were amplified by fire. Fire significantly increased soil CO2 emissions and CH4 uptakes both in the depression and on the ridge. However, the factors that determined soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes and the extent of the response to fire varied with topography. Although the depression released less soil carbon to the atmosphere, the increase in Q(10) of soil CO2 flux and the permafrost degradation following fire in the depression indicated stronger positive feedbacks to climate warming. To concluded, topography regulated the effects of fire on soil carbon fluxes and might control the post-fire soil carbon flux feedbacks to climate warming. Therefore, large-scale predictions of soil carbon fluxes in response to fire in the boreal region must explicitly incorporate topographic features. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In view of this, a detailed study of CBM produced water of Raniganj coalfield has been carried out to evaluate hydro-chemical variations, quantity, quality, related aquifer characteristics, options of treatment, suitable beneficial uses and disposal. The large amount of TDS is the major concern contributed by cations and anions like Na+, Ca2+ and HCO3-. The trace metal content obtained through Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS) analyses such as Fe2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Sr2+ and Al3+ varies from 0.12 to 0.94, 0.002 to 0.651, 0.001 to 0.041, 0.005 to 0.801 and 0.002-0.092 mg/l respectively.

The CBM produced water is classified as Na+-K-CO32--HCO3- and Na+-HCO3- type attributed to different rock formations of aquifers and deeper coal seams. TDS and trace metals concentrations are controlled by depositional environment, local marine transgression occurred during the Sakmarian - Artinskian geological period and inherited from groundwater mineral interactions. The results of proposed model for quality parameter prediction signifies TDS content is observed to be low during the initial five years of production and gradually increases with time. The similar trend is shown by HCO3-, Na+, SO42-, F-, Cl- and NO3- signifying the rock interaction and alterations is the only source of minerals and ions. Initially, the shallow aquifer water having interaction with fresh water recharge dilutes the concentrations of different water quality parameters, but as production continues, the concentration of constituents directly controlled by formation rocks and may increase until it reaches the saturation point.

However, forests are also less reflective than croplands, and the absorption of incoming solar radiation is greater over afforested areas. Afforestation can therefore result in net climate warming, particularly at high latitudes(2-5). Here, we use a comprehensive Earth system model to assess the climate-change mitigation potential of five afforestation scenarios, with afforestation carried out gradually over a 50-year period. Complete (100%) and partial (50%) afforestation of the area occupied at present by crops leads to a reduced warming of around 0.45 and 0 : 25 degrees C respectively, during the period 2081-2100. Temperature benefits associated with more realistic global afforestation efforts, where less than 50% of cropland is converted, are expected to be even smaller, indicating that afforestation is not a substitute for reduced greenhouse-gas emissions.

A significant CO2 capacity improvement of up to 36% was achieved. It was found that higher CO2 uptakes were related to removal of inorganic impurities i.e. mineral matter and increase of the submicropores volume i.e. smaller than 0.8 nm. Sorbents were thoroughly characterized in terms of texture and chemical composition. CO2 uptake was determined by BET isotherm measurement carried out at 273 K and pressure of up to 0.95 bar. The enhancement of CO2 uptake was observed especially for ACs with the highest initial mineral matter content. It was found that mineral matter in ACs plays the role of a ballast and additionally blocks adsorption places and submicropores volume thus lowers CO2 uptake. On the other hand it was proven that mineral matter may prevent the structure from collapsing and thus can stabilize high SSA. The AC surface oxidation effect on CO2 uptake was determined by comparison of ACs treated with HCI and HNO3. Both acids remove mineral matter content to the same degree, but detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study revealed that in case of HNO3 treatment, AC surface was more oxidized which correlated with higher CO2 uptake. However observed uptake increase was attributed to increase of the submicropores volume. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The viability of CO2 storage hinges on how much of the CO2 can be injected into the storage formation. However, the rate of CO2 injection can be limited by low injectivity of the storage formation and limits placed on the injection pressure to maintain seal integrity. Therefore, pressure evolution during CO2 injection is an important consideration for CO2 storage operation and is investigated in this study. We use geological characteristics of a typical oil field near a salt diapir in the Gulf Coast basin in the Southern United States. In this case CO2 is injected into a complex sedimentary rocks deposited in a fluviatile environment, juxtaposing volumes of high-and low-permeability rocks. The rock volume in which CO2 injection is taking place can be modelled, for the purpose of this study, as a simple reservoir surrounded by mud rocks which exhibit small, but finite, permeability and high compressibility. The mud rock is expected to behave as a capillary seal preventing upward CO2 migration, but may allow significant pressure dissipation. This pressure attenuation can be important from an operational standpoint as a fault in the vicinity of the injection well requires an accurate estimate of pressure evolution to avoid leakage along the fault.Most numerical simulations of geological CO2 storage have focused on the behavior of fluids within a storage formation and assumed that overlying and underlying rocks are impermeable and incompressible. Such a reservoir model has immediate pressure buildup and drawdown corresponding to start and end of injection. Numerical simulations using reservoir parameters and a simple geomechanical model based on rock and fluid compressibilities were performed with the commercial simulator GEM from CMG. They show that overlying and underlying mud rocks attenuate pressure build-up within a reservoir during injection and extend the period of pressure recovery after the end of injection. The attenuation of pressure propagation within a target formation can reduce the probability of creation and/or reactivation of geological discontinuities. In addition, strong pressure gradients detected just outside the storage formation require high numerical resolution at the boundaries between the storage formation and mud rocks, otherwise extensive numerical diffusion will lead to unphysical pressure dissipation. It is therefore not just important to include the surrounding rocks but also to discretize them appropriately, and this is currently not standard practice.

The problem is fundamental to forest biology, commercial forestry (the decline sets the rotation age), and to carbon storage in forests. We tested three hypotheses about mechanisms causing the decline in wood growth by quantifying the complete carbon budget of developing stands for over six years (a full rotation) in replicated plantations of Eucalyptus saligna near Pepeekeo, Hawaii. Our first hypothesis was that gross primary production (GPP) does not decline with stand age, and that the decline in wood growth results from a shift in partitioning from wood production to respiration (as tree biomass accumulates), total belowground carbon allocation (as a result of declining soil nutrient supply), or some combination of these or other sinks. An alternative hypothesis was that GPP declines with stand age and that the decline in aboveground wood production is proportional to the decline in GPP. A decline in GPP could be driven by reduced canopy leaf area and photosynthetic capacity resulting from increasing nutrient limitation, increased abrasion between tree canopies. lower turgor pressure to drive foliar expansion, or hydraulic limitation of water flux as tree height increases. A final hypothesis was a combination of the first two: GPP declinus, but the decline in wood production is disproportionately larger because partitioning shifts as well.We measured the entire annual carbon budget (aboveground production and respiration, total belowground carbon allocation [TBCA], and GPP) from 0.5 years after seedling planting through 61/2, years (when trees were similar to25 in tall). The replicated plots included two densities of trees (1111 trees/ha and 10 000 trees/ha) to vary the ratio of canopy leaf mass to wood mass in the individual trees, and three fertilization regimes (minimal, intensive, and minimal followed by intensive after three years) to assess the role of nutrition in shaping the decline in GPP and aboveground wood production.The forest closed its canopy in 1-2 years, with peak aboveground wood production, coinciding with canopy closure, of 1.2-1.8 kg C(.)m(-2.)yr(-1). Aboveground wood production declined from 1.4 yr(-1.) at age 2 to 0.60 kg C-m(-2). kg, C(.)m(-2.)yr(-1) at a yr(-1) at age 6. Hypothesis I failed: GPP declined from 5.0 kg C(.)m(-2.)yr(-1) at age 2 to 3.2 kg C(.)m(-2 .)yr(-1) at age 6. Aboveground woody respiration declined from 0.66 kg C(.)m(-2.)yr(-1) at age 2 to 0.22 kg C.m(-2.) yr(-1) at age 6 and TBCA declined from 1.9 kg C(.)m(-2.)yr\(-1) C, C, at age 2 to 1.4 kg C(.)m(-2.)yr(-1) at age 6. Our data supported hypothesis 3: the decline in aboveground wood production (42% of peak) was proportionally greater than the decline in canopy photosynthesis (64% of peak). The fraction of GPP partitioned to belowground allocation and foliar respiration increased with stand age and contributed to the decline in aboveground wood production. The decline in GPP was not caused by nutrient limitation, a decline in leaf area or in photosynthetic capacity, or (from a related study on the same site) by hydraulic limitation. Nutrition did interact with the decline in GPP and aboveground wood production, because treatments with high nutrient availability declined more slowly than did our control treatment, which was fertilized only during stand establishment.",,,,,,,,,287,19,0,0,241,3,343,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,,,,,,,,,"USDA ARS, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USAColorado State Univ, Dept Forest Rangeland & Watershed Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USAColorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USAUniv Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USAUniv Hawaii, Coll Agr Forestry & Nat Resource Management, Hilo, HI 96720 USA",,,,2004-08-01,WOS:000223455600002,,

During these tests, produced-water (PW) samples were also collected. Integrated analysis of the results of interpretion of the PW analyses and the MRT results has provided a range of information for each production zone, including the nature and composition of the PW, the sea-water fraction of these produced waters, the fraction of total water flow being produced, pressure, productivity index, oil and water rates, and water cut. This information can reduce the need for running production-logging tools (PLTs), allows the scaling potential between the deeper and the shallower zones to be evaluated, aids squeeze-treatment design, is beneficial for predicting formation damage from crossflow, and aids water-shutoff decisions.In an accompanying paper, McCartney et al. (2012) describe how PW analyses from the MRT are interpreted to determine-among other parameters-the amount of water produced from each zone (water allocation) at each of the test rates during an MRT. In this paper, the methods of analyzing these results in combination with separator-test data are described with the aid of a field example to demonstrate how they provide detailed information about the downhole conditions and zone properties of the well. On the basis of the analysis, a set of well interventions was recommended. Following confirmation of the principal MRT results by a PLT, some of the recommended interventions have been performed successfully.

For long-lasting continuous spills like the 2010 3-month Deepwater Horizon (DWH) event in the Gulf of Mexico, it is also important to identify changes in the dominant oil features through time. This study utilized very high resolution (<= 5 m) aerial and satellite imagery acquired during the DWH spill to evaluate the shape, size and thickness of surface oil features that dominated the DWH slick. Results indicate that outside of the immediate spill source region, oil distributions did not encompass a broad, varied range of thicknesses. Instead, the oil separated into four primary, distinct characterizations: 1) invisible surface films detectable only with Synthetic Aperture Radar imaging because of the decreased surface backscatter, 2) thicker sheen & rainbow areas (<0.005 mm), 3) large regional areas of relatively thin, metallic appearance films (0.005-0.08 mm), and 4) strands of thick, emulsified oil (>1 mm) that were consistently hundreds of meters long but most commonly only 10-50 m wide. Where present within the slick footprint, each of the three distinct visible oil thickness classes maintained its shape characteristics both spatially (at different distances from the source and in different portions of the slick), and temporally (from mid-May through July 2010). The region over the source site tended to contain a more continuous range of oil thicknesses, however, our results indicate that the continuous injection of subsurface dispersants starting in late May significantly altered (lowered) that range. In addition to characterizing the oil thickness distribution patterns through the timeline of one of the world's largest oil spills, this paper also details the extension of using high resolution aerial imagery to calibrate medium resolution satellite data sources such as USA's Thematic Mapper (30 m) to provide larger-scale spatial views of major spills, and discusses implications for utilizing such data for oil spill characterizations and spill response.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that three thermophilic strains belonged to the genera Geobacillus, Bacillus and Brevibacillus, and that five mesophilic strains belonged to the genera Pseudomonas, Lysinibacillus, Achromobacter and Halomonas. The bacterial strains were cultivated on crude oil as sole carbon and energy sources, in the presence of different NaCl concentrations (1, 5 and 10%, w/v), and at 37 or 55 degrees C. The hydrocarbon biodegradation potential of each strain was quantified by GC-MS. Strain C450R, phylogenetically related to the species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, showed the maximum crude oil degradation potentiality. During the growth of strain C450R on crude oil (2%, v/v), the emulsifying activity (E24) and glycoside content increased and reached values of 77 and 1.33 g l(-1), respectively.

In view of the inherent hazardous properties of LNG fuel, LNG fueling is not only an important part, but it is also full of high risks in the operation of LNG-fueled vessels (LNGFVs). Therefore, it is necessary to study the risk factors, and the intrinsic relationship among them between the LNG and the vessel, and to simulate the system dynamics in the process of LNGFV operation. During the process of fueling of LNGFV, at every moment the vessel interacts with the energy and information of the surrounding environment. First, the impact of the three interactions of the fueling operation process, ship factors, and environmental factors were analyzed on the risk of fueling operation, and a complete node system was proposed as to the complex system dynamics mode. Second, by analyzing the boundary conditions of the system, the relationship of factors was established via the tools of system dynamics (SD). Based on the catastrophe theory (CA), the dynamics model for the fueling of LNG is set up to study the system's risk mutation phenomenon. Third, combined with the simulation results of the case analysis, the risk evolution mode of the LNGFV during the fueling process was obtained, and constructive opinions were put forward for improving the safe fueling of the LNGFV.

The aim of this study is to compare commercial fuel cell types that can be used in merchant ships and a maximum of 5MW main engine power is considered due to the limited power output of fuel cells. The environmental and economical performances of fuel cell types were compared and criterions' weightings were found according to expert points using the analytic hierarchy process. A final comparison table is formed giving evaluation points for each fuel cell type and weighting for each criterion depending on their importance in the maritime industry. Fuel cells are ranked by eight different criteria and according to experts, safety is the most important criterion and then followed by emissions, efficiency, cost, lifetime, power output, fuel type, and size, respectively. Among seven different fuel cell types; proton exchange membrane, alkaline, phosphoric acid, diesel oil using molten carbonate, liquefied natural gas using molten carbonate, diesel oil using solid oxide and liquefied natural gas using solid oxide fuel cells, the first three places are formed by diesel oil using molten carbonate fuel cell, proton exchange membrane fuel cell and diesel oil using solid oxide fuel cell which are received 4.053, 4.044 and 3.969 respectively from the total point 5.000. As a result, diesel oil using molten carbonate fuel cell, which takes place with a slight margin from proton exchange membrane fuel cell, has been found as the most suitable fuel cell type for ships. This study highlights that despite strict emission regulations, as a fuel, diesel oil is still a strong fuel option for ships with different energy conversion units like fuel cells.

We sampled three locations in Davis Bayou, Mississippi (30.375 degrees N, 88.790 degrees W) representative of a range of oil spill impacts. Measured photosynthesis was negative (respiration only) at the heavily oiled location in July 2010 only, and rates started to increase by August 2010. Photosynthesis at the medium oiling location was lower than at the control location in July 2010 and it continued to decrease in September 2010. During winter 2010-2011, the contrast between the control and the two impacted locations was not as obvious as in the growing season of 2010. Photosynthesis increased through spring 2011 at the three locations and decreased starting with October at the control location and a month earlier (September) at the impacted locations.Using the field data, we developed an HB model. The model simulations agreed well with the measured photosynthesis, capturing most of the variability of the measured data. On the basis of the posteriors of the parameters, we found that air temperature and photosynthetic active radiation positively influenced photosynthesis whereas the leaf stress level negatively affected photosynthesis. The photosynthesis rates at the heavily impacted location had recovered to the status of the control location about 140 days after the initial impact, while the impact at the medium impact location was never severe enough to make photosynthesis significantly lower than that at the control location over the study period. The uncertainty in modeling photosynthesis rates mainly came from the individual and micro-site scales, and to a lesser extent from the leaf scale.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,14,0,20,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ So Mississippi, Dept Coastal Sci, Ocean Springs, MS 39564 USA",,,,2013-02-05,WOS:000312696400052,,

Wetland mesocosms were exposed to oil pre-treated through varying weathering and dosages to induce a range of PAH concentrations. Six trials (consisting of two or three mesocosms) were established using different combinations of oil dosages and weathering durations to elicit a range of initial PAH concentrations in the soil. Wetland soils were sampled per trial and analyzed 2 and 10 weeks following oil exposure for PAHs. Based on initial concentrations (2 weeks post-oil exposure), a total of 42 analytes (dominated by three-, four-, and five-ring compounds) were consistently detected across all trials. The Sigma PAH concentration of wetland trials ranged from 108.1 to 906.2 mg kg(-1) dry weight. Individual PAH analyte reduction and degradation between sampling dates was calculated as the total percent change in analyte concentration and the percent change in analyte concentration relative to the concentration of biomarker hopane, respectively. All trials showed a significant relationship between PAH analyte molecular weight and its percent reduction and percent degradation. Trials with the highest initial SPAH concentration (659.4 and 906.2 mg kg(-1) dry weight) showed the most PAH loss with significantly greater reduction of high-molecular-weight analytes (four-and five-rings) than the other trials. However, when evaluated based on degradation, all trials showed similar trends of percent degradation relative to molecular weight. Our results suggest that oil loss through hydrologic export (i.e., washout from tidal action) may be important after initial oil exposure, and salt marsh soils may have a certain capacity to retain PAHs in soil.",,,,,,,,,6,1,0,0,6,0,10,,,0049-6979,1573-2932,,,,,,,,,,"Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",,,,2013-08-07,WOS:000321666500011,,

In this study, two dominant halophytes in the Jiuduansha Wetland of the Yangtze River estuary, Phragmites communis and Spartina alternifiora, were selected for in-situ and ex-situ decomposition experiments aiming to clarify the difference in decomposition rate of their litter types in soil. Furthermore, plant litter composition, soil organic carbon and humus contents, soil respiration, microbial respiration and soil microbial structure were analyzed to explore dominant decomposition patterns of the two types of litter in soil and their organic carbon sequestration capability, as well as the microbiological mechanisms involved. The S. alterniflora litter decomposed faster in soil than P. communis due to its lower contents of cellulose and lignin. More degradable carbon in S. alternifiora litter induced higher proportions of the microbial community responsible for mineralization in the soil, such as classes D-Proteobacteria and gamma-Proteobacteria and genera Geobacter and Flavobacterium, leading to higher soil respiration. Consequently, despite the S. alterniflora zone having higher aboveground plant biomass than the P. communis zone, there were lower contents of soil organic carbon and humus. The P. communis zone, in contrast, on account of the induced higher proportion of a specific microbial community, such as class Anaerolineae and genera Methylibium, Gallionella and Desulfococcus- which potentially weakened mineralization and accelerated humification-resulted in lower soil respiration and thus higher contents of soil organic carbon and humus. These indicated that plant biomass was not the only factor affecting the soil organic carbon content; plant litter composition was also an important factor because it induced different soil microbial community structures which led to different organic carbon decomposition patterns, and therefore different soil organic carbon sequestration capability.",,,,,,,,,120,22,0,0,99,0,143,,,0016-7061,1872-6259,,,,,,,,,,"Tongji Univ, Key Lab Yangtze River Water Environm, Minist Educ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Inst Pollut Control & Ecol Secur, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaEduc Univ Hong Kong, Dept Sci & Environm Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaFudan Univ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ, Sch Life Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Jiuduansha Wetland Nat Reserve Adm, Shanghai 200135, Peoples R China",Shanghai Inst Pollut Control & Ecol SecurShanghai Jiuduansha Wetland Nat Reserve Adm,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000426224800020,,

Politics continues to contribute to poorly conceived contingency planning in which adopted scenarios bear little resemblance to events that subsequently transpire.

We investigated the demographic mechanisms of above-ground biomass recovery over 48 years in an Australian tropical forest following four silvicultural treatments: selective logging only as a control and selective logging followed by low-, medium- and high-intensity thinning. Initial biomass recovery rates following thinning were poor predictors of the long-term changes. Initial biomass recovery from 1969 to 1973 was slow and was largely concentrated on an increase in the biomass of residual stems. From 1973 to 1997, above ground biomass (AGB) increased almost linearly, with a similar slope for all sites. From 1997 to 2015, the rate of biomass accumulation slowed, especially for the L treatment. All thinning treatments stimulated more recruitment and regrowth of non-harvested remaining trees compared to the untreated control. Biomass at both the low and medium intensity treatments has almost fully recovered to 98% and 97% of pre-logging biomass levels respectively. The predicted times of complete above-ground biomass recovery for the logging only and high intensity treatments are 55 and 77 years respectively. The slower biomass recovery at the logging only site was largely due to increased mortality in the last measurement period. The slower recovery of the high intensity site was due to a combination of a higher initial reduction in biomass from thinning and the increased mortality in the last measurement period. The high mortality rates in the most recent measurement period are likely due to the impacts of two cyclones that impacted the study site.

Increased connectivity is shown to deliver reductions of over $2/GJ in average gas prices across the eastern seaboard, with a subsequent reduction in electricity prices across all mainland National Electricity Market (NEM) regions.

The spread of a flammable gas cloud is susceptible to external factors and highly uncertain, but the GDSs deployed today often raise alarms based on certainty. It means that the threshold value set in a GDS for triggering alarms is a constant. Such an approach sometimes cannot accurately determine the leakage location, and so it may result in a great delay of gas detection. To reduce the risk of gas leakage, this paper proposes a flexible triggering mechanism for GDSs, where an alarm is raised or not depending on the number of sensors whose reading are reaching or closing to the preset threshold. An equivalent gas cloud (EGC) model is introduced here to provide design inputs for such a flexible triggering GDS. The volume and location distribution of an EGC are estimated with the Gaussian dispersion model, based on the changes of wind speed and direction. A case study in a terminal station of LNG is conducted, to illustrate the effectiveness of the new approach. The findings show that the flexible triggering mechanism is able to make alarms of a GDS more accurate, and meanwhile avoiding unnecessary measures, which can effectively optimize alarming thresholds.

This work will primarily use a unique dataset of oceanic near-surface hourly currents provided by the trajectories of surface drifting buoys from the Global Drifter Program (GDP). The approach is guided by an analysis of tidal energetics which distinguishes between time-mean, or phase-locked, baroclinic tides and time-variable, or non-phase-locked, baroclinic tides. The GDP dataset is both large enough and sufficiently accurate that it should permit quantitative assessment of both types of baroclinic tides, and specifically test theoretical models for the scattering of phase-locked tides into non-phase-locked tides. In addition, the analyses will permit the mapping---for both phase-locked and non-phase-locked tides---of dissipation rate coefficients and their associated dynamical processes, which can be distinct based on geographical locations and environmental conditions. Such mapping will provide much needed information for improving the realism and physical parameterization of tidal mixing in ocean general circulation models. The work will contribute to the goal of measuring on a global scale upper-ocean currents which ubiquitously exhibit energetic oscillations at tidal frequencies. Improved prediction of ocean surface currents will have societal impacts for stakeholders ranging from the shipping industry to seasonal climate forecasters. The project will also contribute to a climate-themed educational program including summer camps, hands-n activites, and enhancements to existing school field trip programs.<br/><br/>Estimates of the phase-locked tides are presently available from the analysis of satellite altimeter data,and these estimates have led to the creation of baroclinic tide models, which this project will test and extend using the GDP data. As tidal dynamics includes both wave scattering and wave dissipation, testing these models will place constraints on the range of physically plausible parameterizations for these processes on regional and global scales. Finally, the GDP data shall be systematically compared with outputs of a tide and mesoscale-resolving ocean global circulation model, an exercise which will be useful for validating the model simulations as well as providing a useful context for understanding potential biases of the GDP observations and statistical methods applied. This project will generate new knowledge concerning tidal currents in order to better understand tidal dynamics and their role in the maintenance of the global thermohaline ocean circulation. The new drifter dataset that will be utilized to investigate baroclinic tidal phenomena is both large enough and unique (temporally, spatially and accuracy wise) to provide a quantitative description of tidal properties.

This paper describes a methodology to enable spatial estimates of uncertainty to be attached to predictions of tree growth in relation to variations in soil depth, nutrient status, and drainage. An environmental sensitivity analysis was applied using the growth model PROMOD to produce site productivity and suitability maps for Eucalyptus globulus (Labill.) on a 1000m regular grid of Tasmania. Nine productivity surfaces were computed, one for each of three assumed soil-water holding capacities (for soil depths of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5m - the common classes in Tasmania), combined with three permutations of soil-nutrient rating (the expected rating and one class above and one below this value), and incorporating potential waterlogging estimates. The mean and coefficient of variation was calculated for each 1000m grid cell in the nine subsequent productivity surfaces. A final plantation suitability grid was then mapped to show areas of the State with predicted high (>25 m(3) ha(-1) per year), moderate (15-25 m(3) ha(-1) per year), and low productivity (<15 m(3) ha(-1) per year), each with corresponding high variability (coefficient of variation (CV>30%)) and low variability classes (CV<30%). As no areas had both, high productivity and high variability, only five plantation suitability classes were mapped.Those areas indicated as high productivity/low variation sites have a high probability of being successful E. globulus plantations. Low productivity sites with either high or low variation are very unlikely to be favourable for this species. Moderate productivity sites with low variation are likely to be viable potential plantation sites with relatively low risk, particularly with nutrient amelioration. Moderate productivity sites with high variation might warrant further field investigation to determine if there are major environmental factors or combinations Of these, such as soil depth (water holding capacity), nutrient status, or drainage that are actually going to be limiting reasonable growth at these sites.

Management to reduce fire frequency and intensity in savannas could substantially increase the amount of carbon stored in woody biomass. We addressed two questions: (1) are northern Australian savannas thickening; and (2) to what extent, and by what demographic processes, does fire affect woody biomass accumulation?LocationThree large national parks, covering 24,000km(2), in monsoonal northern Australia.MethodsWe examined changes in woody biomass carbon stocks - inferred from tree basal area and the density of woody understorey plants - over a 10-year period in 136 savanna monitoring plots. We statistically assessed these changes in relation to fire frequency and severity. We used a meta-analysis to identify general trends in woody cover in Australian savannas over the last half-century.ResultsWoody biomass carbon stocks were relatively stable across the three national parks, but rates of change were statistically indistinguishable from earlier findings of a weak thickening trend. Change was negatively correlated with fire frequency, particularly the frequency of severe fires. High frequencies of severe fires decreased rates of accumulation of biomass by existing trees (through reductions in tree growth and death of individual stems), rather than whole-tree mortality and suppression of recruitment. However, across northern Australia, our meta-analysis identified a general, albeit weak, trend of woody thickening.Main conclusionsThe drivers of northern Australia's weak thickening trend are uncertain, but likely candidates include increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and water availability, and pastoral intensification. We demonstrate that changes to fire management have the potential to either increase or decrease rates of woody thickening relative to any underlying trend. Understanding how savanna fires affect woody biomass, and how fire effects are mediated by climate and CO2, are essential research priorities to predict the fate of savannas.",,,,,,,,,61,0,0,0,42,0,63,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Melbourne, Sch Bot, NERP Environm Decis Hub, Parkville, Vic 3010, AustraliaMacquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ryde, NSW 2109, AustraliaUniv Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, ScotlandCharles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia",,,,2014-01-01,WOS:000328271500012,,

Improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms is vital for constraining future projections, which presently have high uncertainties. To identify some of the causes behind this uncertainty, this study investigates the North Atlantic's anthropogenically altered carbon uptake and inventory, that is, changes in carbon uptake and inventory due to rising atmospheric CO2 and climate change (abbreviated as Cant*-uptake and Cant*-inventory). Focus is set on an ensemble of 11 Earth system models and their simulations of a future with high atmospheric CO2. Results show that the model spread in the Cant*-uptake originates in middle and high latitudes. Here, the annual cycle of oceanic pCO2 reveals inherent model mechanisms that are responsible for different model behavior: while it is SST-dominated for models with a low future Cant*-uptake, it is dominated by deep winter mixing and biological production for models with a high future Cant*-uptake. Models with a high future Cant*-uptake show an efficient carbon sequestration and hence store a large fraction of their contemporary North Atlantic Cant*-inventory below 1000-m depth, while the opposite is true for models with a low future Cant*-uptake. Constraining the model ensemble with observation-based estimates of carbon sequestration and summer oceanic pCO2 anomalies and yields later flattening of the Cant*-uptake than previously estimated.

The Chinese government is seeking methods to reduce anthropogenic CO2 gas emission. CO2 capture and geological storage is one of the main methods. In addition, injecting CO2 is also an effective method to replenish formation energy in developing tight oil reservoirs. However, exiting methods to estimate CO2 storage capacity are all based on the material balance theory. This was absolutely correct for normal reservoirs. However, as natural fractures widely exist in tight oil reservoirs and majority of them are vertical ones, tight oil reservoirs are not close. Therefore, material balance theory is not adaptive. In the present study, a new method to calculate CO2 storage capacity is presented. The CO2 effective storage capacity, in this new method, consisted of free CO2, CO2 dissolved in oil and CO2 dissolved in water. Case studies of tight oil reservoir from Ordos Basin was conducted and it was found that due to far lower viscosity of CO2 and larger solubility in oil, CO2 could flow in tight oil reservoirs more easily. As a result, injecting CO2 in tight oil reservoirs could obviously enhance sweep efficiency by 24.5% and oil recovery efficiency by 7.5%. CO2 effective storage capacity of Chang 7 tight oil reservoir in Longdong area was 1.88x10(7) t. The Chang 7 tight oil reservoir in Ordos Basin was estimated to be 6.38x10(11) t.

Yet, the contribution of marsh oiling to landscape-scale degradation and subsequent land loss has been difficult to quantify. Here, we applied advanced remote sensing techniques to map changes in marsh land cover and open water before and after oiling. We segmented the marsh shorelines into non-oiled and oiled reaches and calculated the land loss rates for each 10% increase in oil cover (e.g. 0% to >70%), to determine if land loss rates for each reach oiling category were significantly different before and after oiling. Finally, we calculated background land-loss rates to separate natural and oil-related erosion and land loss. Oiling caused significant increases in land losses, particularly along reaches of heavy oiling (>20% oil cover). For reaches with >= 20% oiling, land loss rates increased abruptly during the 2010-2013 period, and the loss rates during this period are significantly different from both the pre-oiling (p < 0.0001) and 2013-2016 post-oiling periods (p < 0.0001). The pre-oiling and 2013-2016 post-oiling periods exhibit no significant differences in land loss rates across oiled and non-oiled reaches (p = 0.557). We conclude that oiling increased land loss by more than 50%, but that land loss rates returned to background levels within 3-6 years after oiling, suggesting that oiling results in a large but temporary increase in land loss rates along the shoreline.",,,,,,,,,20,1,0,0,13,0,24,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, San Diego, CA 92182 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUS Geol Survey, Box 25046, Denver, CO 80225 USAUS Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA USA",,,,2017-08-02,WOS:000406768200019,28767649,

This method utilized an acoustic imaging sonar and acoustic Doppler sonar operating onboard a remotely operated vehicle for noncontact measurement of flow cross-section and velocity from the well's two leak sites. Over 2,500 sonar cross-sections and over 85,000 Doppler velocity measurements were recorded during the acquisition process. These data were then applied to turbulent jet and plume flow models to account for entrained water and calculate a combined hydrocarbon flow rate from the two leak sites at seafloor conditions.

Plantation forestry is an important industry in Tasmania, and is based on large scale plantations of Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus and E. nitens). The area covered by forestry plantations in Tasmania (on State land) exceeds 100 000 ha, while plantations on private land double this number. Eucalypt plantations are managed primarily for the production of high-value pruned logs for industry; however, unpruned saw logs, peelers, poles, posts and pulp are also produced, and significant quantities of residue are produced as a byproduct. This study was an economic analysis that considered on-site biochar production system using post-harvest forestry residues, with biochar being utilized within the system, or sold as a product. The financial analysis was based on previous experimental outcomes on the use of Macadamia shell biochar in Eucalyptus nitens plantations, and the local operating environment in Tasmania; including current forestry procedures used for managing plantations. A number of assumptions were considered concerning a) production costs, b) savings enjoyed by traditional operations, following biochar scenario implementation, and c) biochar sales. The analysis revealed a potential annual income of over 179 k$ (2014 value) and the sensitivity analysis identified the crucial factors responsible for scenario profitability, namely biochar price and final product distribution.

This unprecedented volume of dispersant application highlighted the importance of dispersant chemical formulations, raising questions of dispersant fate and transport in the open ocean and spurring research into formulation improvements. The research presented here elucidates the contribution of photolytic processes to the degradation of two solvent constituents of these dispersant mixtures: propylene glycol (PG) and 2-butoxyethanol (2-BE). A series of photodegradation experiments were conducted to determine the contribution of direct photolysis and indirect photolysis via hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) to compound degradation. Experiments were performed using both deep UV light sources (low pressure (LP) and medium pressure (MP) mercury vapor ultraviolet (UV) lamps) and a solar simulator. Sample matrices included ultrapure water, nitrate amended water, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) spiked water, Gulf of Mexico seawater, and a surface water from Boulder, CO. Experiments included determination of the molar absorption coefficients (epsilon) and the HO center dot reaction rate constants (k(HO)center dot) of the individual compounds. Data illustrated that significant direct photolysis of either PG or 2-BE from sunlight is unlikely. The k(HO)center dot for PG and 2-BE were determined to be 6.15 x 10(8) M-1 s(-1) and 1.15 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), respectively. Solar simulation and UV experiments indicate that in natural systems, neither PG nor 2-BE is expected to undergo significant, rapid degradation due to direct or indirect photolysis. PG and 2-BE are effectively degraded through indirect photolysis in the presence of high HO center dot concentrations, suggesting UV/H2O2 is a feasible possibility for the treatment of waters containing PG and 2-BE.
