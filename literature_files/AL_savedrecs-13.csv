It consisted of an adaptive resonance theory (ART) module, an ART Mapping module, and a centroid determination module. Monte Carlo simulation was integrated with the TSAM approach to address uncertainties that widely exist in site conditions. The applicability of the proposed model was validated by classifying a large coastal area, which was surrounded by potential oil spill sources, based on 12 features. Statistical analysis of the results indicated that the classification process was affected by multiple features instead of one single feature. The classification results also provided the least or desired number of zones which can sufficiently represent the levels of offshore OSVI in an area under uncertainty and complexity, saving time and budget in spill monitoring and response.

The process is of paramount importance in case of the offshore jacket-type platforms due to the underwater structural parts subjected to the marine environmental conditions. This work is an experimental investigation on a laboratory model of a jacket platform with the objective of establishing a baseline finite element (FE) model for long-term structural health monitoring for this type of structures. A robust damage diagnosis system is also developed which is less sensitive to both the measurements and the modeling uncertainties. Experimental vibration tests are conducted on a physical platform model to obtain dynamic characteristics and then, the initial FE-model of the intact structure is developed to determine them numerically. Some differences between numerically and experimentally identified characteristics emerge due to various uncertainties in the FE-model and measured vibration data. To minimize these differences, initial FE-model is updated according to the experimental results. The updated FE-model is employed to predict the changes in the dynamic characteristics under variety of damage scenarios which are imposed by reducing the stiffness at the components of the model. Fuzzy logic system (FLS) and probabilistic analysis is developed for linguistic classification of damage and global damage diagnosis. Incorporation of the FLS fault isolation technique into FE-model updating method are proposed and evaluated for two different FLS methods to develop a vigorous damage diagnosis method. The efficiency of the technique is validated by different damage scenarios foreseen on the physical model. This technique is shown to be effective for diagnosing the presence of degradation and quantify it. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Field leaching studies from 11 sites indicate that undersown ryegrass (Lolium spp.) CCs are robust, with average N uptake in aboveground CC biomass of 7 to 38 kg N ha(-1) (6.2 to 34 lb N ac(-1)). Use of CCs sown at harvest (e.g., crucifers) is restricted to southern Scandinavia for climate reasons. The mean relative reduction in N leaching reported for all CCs investigated was 43%, but it ranged between 62% increase instead of a reduction after a red clover (Trifolium pratense) CC on a clay soil to a reduction of 85% to 89% with a perennial ryegrass CC on sandy soils in Denmark (36 to 51 kg ha(-1) [32 to 46 lb ac(-1)]). The data indicate that CCs do not substantially reduce total P losses by runoff and leaching. The effects of CCs on total P leaching varied between a relative increase of 86% and a decrease of 43%. Climate conditions involving freezing-thawing during winter increased the risk of losses of dissolved P from CC biomass. CCs have been implemented to varying degrees into agri-environmental programs. They are mandatory in Denmark and subsidized in Norway, Sweden, and Finland. CCs are grown on 8% of arable land in Denmark, 5% in Sweden, 1% in Finland, and 0.5% in Norway, but CC area is now increasing dramatically in Finland due to a new subsidy program. In all countries there is a need, and potential, for increased use of CCs, but there are several constraints, particularly reduced interest among farmers. There is a clear need to identify CC systems and develop implementation strategies for appropriate distribution of CCs on different soils and regions with respect to required reductions in N leaching and P losses. For this, more knowledge is required, especially about the effect of CCs on P losses (e.g., the effect of species with different partitioning between shoot and root biomass and the effects of CC systems with harvesting of biomass). There is also a need to devise balanced solutions for maintaining and increasing the frequency of CCs in crop rotations to exploit the possible benefits of CCs in reducing nutrient losses.",,,,,,,,,83,3,0,0,55,1,97,,,0022-4561,1941-3300,,,,,,,,,,"Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Soil & Environm, Extens Duties, Uppsala, SwedenSwedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Soil & Environm, Uppsala, SwedenNorwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Environm Div, As, NorwayAarhus Univ, Dept Agroecol, Tjele, DenmarkNat Resources Inst, Div Nat Resources & Bioprod, Jokioinen, FinlandPenn State Univ, Dept Plant Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000367460000009,,

Yet rework costs are frequently dismissed as isolated and rare instances of unfortunate circumstances and alien to normal practice. Original evidence stemming from this research indicates that cost and schedule overruns are a recurrent feature of offshore projects. Moreover, the risk of overruns are further exacerbated by increasingly complex commercial and contracting arrangements, technical challenges, changing local economic and regulatory conditions, and a shift towards projects being undertaken in peak oil frontier regions. To acquire new knowledge on the dynamics of offshore rework, the experiences of 23 oil and gas industry practitioners were captured using in-depth interviews. A risk classification matrix was subsequently developed in order to provide a frame of reference to mitigate future rework.

The study represents the first detailed account of adult red snapper from a northern Gulf estuary. Red snapper (n = 302) collected from the study site ranged in size from 229 - 714 mm TL; 172 were retained for laboratory examination, and 130 were tagged and released. Age estimates for some specimens (n = 36; 326 - 713 min TL) ranged from 2 - 5 years. Histological assessment of gonads from a small sample of fish (n = 13) collected primarily during late summer and fall (near the end of the spawning season) revealed sexually mature males (n = 5; 390 - 520 mm TL) and females with regressed ovaries (n = 5; 326 - 662 nun TL) or immature ovaries (n = 2; 326 and 330 mm TL). However, ovaries from a single female collected during July (during the peak of the spawning season) contained oocytes in the final oocyte maturation (FOM) stage, an indication of imminent spawning. This finding was of great interest since red snapper are reported to spawn only in offshore waters. Snapper diet consisted of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods. Anchovies (Anchoa hepsetus and A. sp.) and hardhead catfish (Ariusfelis), were the dominant prey in the diet and occurred in 54 % of stomachs. Gulf crab (Callinectes similis), other portunid crabs, and penaeid shrimps were the primary crustaceans in the diet. Tag-recaptures (n = 32) were from the site of tag-release only and extended from 1 - 373 days-at-large. Recaptures documented growth for fish, primarily juveniles and young adults, at the study site and suggested site fidelity and overwintering for some fish.

For example, the complexity of oil and gas in the offshore areas of the Arctic seas associated with the risk of collisions with icebergs floating platforms. It proposed to develop a project aimed at studying the effects of ice and water in offshore and coastal transport systems, including fixed and floating platforms, piers, bottom lines, and others. The result of the project will be software for predictive modeling and assessing the reliability of technical objects, constructed in arctic regions the purpose of development of hydrocarbon deposits. The subject of the analysis can be both existing and planned facilities. The project will address the following important practical problems: 1. Analysis of possibilities for use in arctic conditions, piping made of composite materials. 2. Collision hummock (iceberg) from the seabed or underwater pipelines. 3. Effects of storm waves on the shore facilities. 4. The development of offshore gas hydrate deposits with inclusions, predicting and assessing the risks of man-made phenomena associated with the production cycles and changes in the state of engineering structures under the influence of thawing permafrost and associated gas hydrate phase transitions. Numerical modeling of the mentioned tasks will improve the understanding of the processes and thereby increase the effectiveness of safety, such as oil platforms and ultimately to optimize the process of oil production. Their solution is proposed to develop mechanics and mathematical models of ice spatial structures and their interaction with the complex structures in the Arctic, the development of numerical methods and their implementation on the high-performance computing systems. On the basis of the developed numerical methods and mathematical models of mechanics and is expected to create software for the numerical simulation of natural effects on coastal and offshore industrial objects and solving exploration in the Arctic using high-precision computational algorithms on high-performance computing systems. The developed methods will correctly describe wave processes occurring in large tracts of ice at their impact on the oil and gas transport system. The use of hierarchical meshes with a multiple time step and high-performance systems will describe the geometry, as close to real. There will also be developed parallelized algorithms for the numerical solution of dynamic spatial problems on high-performance multiprocessor computer systems. Using a grid-characteristic methods with high-order interpolation on unstructured tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes will allow to apply the most correct computational algorithms on the borders and boundaries of the contact area of integration, to take into account the physics of the problem (the propagation of discontinuities along the characteristics). Using fully closed system of equations of continuum mechanics and characteristic methods will provide all the characteristics of seismic processes (velocity field, stress field, strain), compared calculations and unique field measurements obtained from the immediate practical experiments, a detailed analysis of these problems on the basis of a series of numerical experiments to identify the areas of destruction, to use a software package for numerical experiments aimed at assessing the resources of hydrocarbons in the offshore Arctic areas. Typically, they are porous layers, saturated hydrates, water and hydrocarbon gases. The project provides for research aimed at hydrodynamic modeling, geo-mechanical and physico-chemical processes occurring during the development and study of gas hydrate deposits. This is necessary to ensure the safety of mining activities and trunsportu hydrocarbons from gas hydrate deposits. Until now, the problems of this kind generally used approximation methods that do not provide a complete picture of wave phenomena. Using fully closed system of equations of continuum mechanics and characteristic method allows to obtain the characteristics of impacts (the velocity field, the stress field, strain) and to compare the calculated synthetic and field data for subsequent solution of inverse problems.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,16-11-00100,,,,,,,,Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15291847,,

These narratives relate fundamentally unsettling experiences for the explorer-colonizer as well as provide layers of contesting discourses. There has long been an enduring interest in the captivity myth and the persistent metaphor of the shipwreck in the colonial imagination. Postcolonial South African writers have also found inspiration from the idea of the shipwreck. This paper examines An Instant in the Wind by Andre Brink, an imaginative revision of the legendary Eliza Fraser shipwreck and captivity which occurred off the coast of Australia in the nineteenth century. Brink transposes the Fraser shipwreck narrative to eighteenth century colonial South Africa to investigate the history of encounters between white colonials and indigenous peoples. He writes in a long tradition of castaway narratives to reveal various obstacles and conflicting oppositions that constitute contact between the races.A major dissident Afrikaner writer, Brink’s fiction focuses on the involution of myth and history in the making of the colonial imagination and its relevance to South Africa’s own history of domination and subordination. An Instant in the Wind attempts to refocalize the narrative away from the perspective of the colonizer, providing an alternative history of two individuals forming an interracial relationship based on recognition of each other’s humanity. In portraying the black African protagonist, the novel at times relies on Eurocentric oppositions and stereotypes of the African Other and on a romantic notion of individualism and interracial intimacy. The disruptive presence of conventional eurocentric discourses in the novel exposes the challenge of giving voice to the silent black in white fiction. Despite some of the pitfalls of trying to reinvent an alternate history for the Other, however, Brink’s revision of the shipwreck myth manages to enact his particular view of history and story-making and produce an indirect but scathing condemnation and commentary on the history of colonial violence on the African continent.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1598-5431,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2011-01-01,KJD:ART001616982,,

This gas may migrate upward and recycle back into the hydrate stability zone to form hydrate. As of yet, however, no quantitative description of the methane recycling process has been developed using multiphase flow simulations to model burial driven gas hydrate recycling. In this study, we present a series of 1D multiphase transport simulations to investigate the methane recycling process in detail. By invoking the effects of capillary phenomena on hydrate and gas formation in pores of varying size, we find that a free gas phase can migrate a significant distance above the bulk base of hydrate stability. Since the top of the free gas occurrence is often identified as the base of the hydrate stability zone from seismic data, our results demonstrate that not only could this assumption mischaracterize a hydrate system, but that under recycling conditions the highest hydrate saturations can occur beneath the top of the free gas occurrence. We show that the presence of pore size distributions requires a replacement zone through which hydrate saturations progressively decrease with depth and are replaced with free gas.

The impact is likely to depend on livestock density. Yet, few studies have tested this principle or evaluated the consistency of grazer-carbon relationships across multiple sites. We sampled four intertidal zones across 22 salt marshes along a 650 km stretch of coast in the UK to examine the impact of livestock density on globally important saltmarsh blue carbon stocks. Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts. Our work suggests that grazing effects on carbon stocks are minimal on broader scales in comparison with the influence of environmental context. The benefits of grazing management to carbon stores are likely to be highly context dependent. Copyright: CC BY 4.0",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-09-30,DRCI:DATA2019163016228706,,

The results showed that both built-up land and water area increased markedly between the 1980s and 2010, whereas all other types of land use decreased, especially for cropland and grassland. Land transitions showed relatively concentrated distributions near coastline areas and dispersed distributions in inland areas. Between the 1980s and 2010, land use changes resulted in a decrease of 43.20 million US$.a(-1) ESV that was primarily caused by the transition from cropland to built-up land, wetland to grassland and built-up land, and water area to cropland and built-up land. A proposed optimized land use structure would result in an increase of 435.20 million US$.a(-1) without considering any expansion of the area, ESV in 2020 compared to that in 2010 might demonstrate an effective method for land managers to adopt. The main type of transfer for ESV loss involves the future occupation of wetlands and croplands by built-up land, and the transformation of cropland into water area will greatly offset this loss. There continues to be a high probability that the coastline area will experience land transfer by 2020, coastline is the key region that needs strict land use management or control.

Following first response actions, bioremediation has emerged as the best strategy for combating oil spills and can be enhanced by the following two complementary approaches: bioaugmentation and biostimulation. Bioaugmentation is one of the most controversial issues of bioremediation. Studies that compare the relative performance of bioaugmentation and biostimulation suggest that nutrient addition alone has a greater effect on oil biodegradation than the addition of microbial products because the survival and degradation ability of microbes introduced to a contaminated site are highly dependent on environmental conditions. Microbial populations grown in rich media under laboratory conditions become stressed when exposed to field conditions in which nutrient concentrations are substantially lower. There is increasing evidence that the best approach to overcoming these barriers is the use of microorganisms from the polluted area, an approach proposed as autochthonous bioaugmentation (ABA) and defined as a bioaugmentation technology that exclusively uses microorganisms indigenous to the sites (soil, sand, and water) slated for decontamination. In this work, we examined the effectiveness of strategies combining autochthonous bioaugmentation with biostimulation for successful remediation of polluted marine environments. Seawater was collected from a pristine area (Agios Onoufrios Beach, Chania) and was placed in a bioreactor with 1% v/v crude oil to facilitate the adaptation of the indigenous microorganism population. The pre-adapted consortium and the indigenous population were tested in combination with inorganic or lipophilic nutrients in the presence (or absence) of biosurfactants (rhamnolipids) during 90-day long experiments. Chemical analysis (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of petroleum hydrocarbons confirmed the results of previous work demonstrating that the biodegradation processes were enhanced by the addition of lipophilic fertilizers (uric acid and lecithin) in combination with biosurfactants (rhamnolipids), resulting in increased removal of petroleum hydrocarbons as well as reduction of the lag phase within 15 days of treatment. Considering this outcome and examining the results, the use of biostimulation additives in combination with naturally pre-adapted hydrocarbon-degrading consortia (bioaugmentation) has proved to be an effective treatment and is a promising strategy that could be applied specifically when an oil spill approaches near a shore line and an immediate hydrocarbon degradation effort is needed.

The MMS is currently reviewing and updating their supplemental bonding requirements, and in this paper, we discuss the potential impacts of an increase in the bond levels required. While the size of the increase will depend on the amount of risk MMS will assume, the average cost of plugging and abandonment and structure removal operations are between two and eight times greater than the current bond formula.

J,,,,,,,,,Judith Bovensiepen,,Anticipating Prosperity: A Study of Community Expectations and the Petroleum Industry in Timor-Leste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Apr 30 2015,2015,"Timor-Leste is a small country in Southeast Asia currently facing the challenge of state-building after an exceptionally brutal occupation by Indonesia (1975-1999) and prior colonisation by Portugal. Historically, Timor has recurrently evoked El Dorado-like dreams of great resource wealth, which until recently were never realised. When the country re-gained independence in 2002, the government managed to secure a 50% share in revenues from its offshore oil and gas reserves that Australia had claimed. Even though negotiations with Australia are still ongoing, the East Timorese government is currently planning to build a large industrial complex to bring oil and gas from offshore fields in the Timor Sea to its shores. The planned scheme has given rise to a great sense of anticipation that Timor-Leste's oil wealth will facilitate the development of a modern and prosperous nation. The aim of this study is to examine these visions of the future ethnographically and to explore how public expectations are articulated in relation to pre-existing ideas about the sacred significance of the lived environment. It seeks to advance anthropological debates about resource extraction and related expectations of modernity by investigating how local logics inform national imaginaries of modernity and how government promises foster utopian dreams of sudden societal transformations. The Petroleum Corridor is the centrepiece of the national Strategic Development Plan for 2020, and envisages the development of three industrial clusters on the thinly populated southwest coast of the country. Plans include the building of a supply base, a pipeline, a port, an oil refinery, a petrochemical complex, an LNG plant and a modern four-lane highway. Residents along the highway route and around the sites of the new facilities would be relocated to grid-planned 'new cities'. Hence despite the great sense of hope connected to the petroleum industry, concerns have been raised that affected populations will loose their land and that the planned resettlement may intensify current conflicts over land ownership. This research aims to document existing tensions over resource entitlements, information that is essential for securing the livelihoods of rural communities and to establish a socially responsible extraction industry. Today, Timor-Leste is the second most petroleum-dependent country in the world, yet 50 per cent of the population live below the poverty line. This has given rise to warnings that the country will soon be subject to the 'resource curse', a term used to describe the problems oil-rich economies face as they become dependent on import with little investment in agriculture and other economic sectors. Similarly, most current social science studies approach the topic of petroleum by examining the corruption, violent conflicts, environmental destruction and social inequalities that this 'cursed' resource can engender. While these analyses are important, they tend to draw a rather absolute distinction between state-planners on the one hand, and local communities that are marginalised by these projects on the other. By contrast, the focus of this project is on the expectations and aspirations that are connected to natural resources, identifying not just the concerns that the growth of the petroleum industry creates, but also the anticipation and hope that such schemes evoke. It will do so by teasing out the differences between state and local perspectives as well as taking into account variations in attitudes among affected populations. An ethnographic study of divergent public attitudes towards the petroleum industry may help to avoid its potentially adverse impact, ensuring that people benefit from the country's wealth in ways that they themselves desire, thereby fostering peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region more generally.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,ES/L010232/1,,,,,,,,University of Kent,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15410502,,

The research purpose is to achieve immediate response time in the detection of kicks to deploy control measures. The contribution of the study is an inexpensive and generalizable automated mud-logging system for the analysis and detection of kicks in underwater drilling projects. The research innovatively implemented the genetic wavelet neural network method to monitor and predict kicks in real time. The developed kick-detection system is able to capture and represent complex input and output relationships of the primary and secondary indicators of the kick to detect any anomalies and display warning messages. Field engineers then use these messages to confirm the possible occurrence of a kick and inform the driller to perform the appropriate control.

PIP systems are generally filled up with adiabatic materials in annular space, and the inner carrier pipe always suffers a high temperature load. The possible buckling deformations of inner and outer pipes are not synchronous, and the carrier pipe may buckle under some shorter wavelengths in the annular spaces. Depending on the PIP structures, the buckling deformations of carrier and casing pipes are interrelated because bulkheads, donut plates and spacers can all transfer lateral deformations. This paper aims at acquiring a more precise description on PIP system buckling process by using FE models. Two typical PIP structures are discussed in this paper. One can be called compliant systems which has a connection between the carrier pipe and the casing pipe at close intervals by donut plates. The connection can act as steel water-stops and allow the lateral displacement of the carrier pipe to be transferred to the casing pipe directly. The other PIP structure can be called non-compliant systems, in which, the carrier and casing pipes have structural connections through the bulkheads, which may either be placed at the pipeline extremities or at discrete locations, usually at inter-vats of a few kilometers along the pipeline length to transfer axial load. The possible buckling behavior of such PIP systems are discussed in this paper and some interesting results are presented.",,,,,17th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE 2007)17th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE 2007),"JUL 01-06, 2007JUL 01-06, 2007",,"Lisbon, PORTUGALLisbon, PORTUGAL",1,1,0,0,0,0,2,,,1098-6189,,978-1-880653-68-5,,,,,,,,,"Dalian Univ Technol, Dept Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Dalian, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Petr, Offshore Oil Gas Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaOffshore Oil Engn Ltd, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Offshore Oil Engn Ltd,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000250717701029,,

I analyze the accuracy of the VIIRS Nightfire published flare detection results, comparing yearly estimated flaring rates to reported flaring data from governments in 9 countries (Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, USA, UK) and 7 years (2012-2018 inclusive).

A total of 1054 flare volume estimates were compared to volumes reported to government agencies. 80.8% of flare estimates lie within 0.5 orders of magnitude (OM) of reported volumes, which 93.7% fall within 1 OM of the reported volume. Little systematic bias is found except in the smallest size classes (<106 m(3) y(-1)). Relative error ratios are larger for smaller flares. No significant trend was observed across years, and variation by country is in line with that expected by size distribution of flares by country. Wide aggregate estimates for groups of flares will exhibit little bias and dispersion, with the sum of 1000 flares having an expected interquartile range of -6% to +3% of actual reported volumes.

There was also evidence of some trace contamination (< 1 ppm) in samples collected several km from the wreck. Preliminary results indicated that the oil was biodegraded, i.e. through loss of most of the n-alkanes. However, comparison with a sample of crude oil similar to the Braer cargo oil, suggests that the oil had already been biodegraded in-reservoir.

However, some factors can influence the accurate interpretation and evaluation of well logging results. Except washouts, the invasions of drilling fluid probably also seriously distorts the results of well logging. In this work, we performed numerical simulations to study the dynamic behavior and general rules of mud invasion into oceanic gas hydrate bearing sediments (GHBS) by taking hydrate reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico as a case. Compared with the conventional oil/gas-bearing sediments, hydrate dissociation and reformation are the main characteristics of mud invasion in GHBS when the invasion condition is in an unstable region of gas hydrates phase diagram. The simulation results show that the density (i. e., corresponding pressure), temperature, and salt content of drilling fluids have great effects on the process of drilling fluid invasion. When the temperature and salt content of drilling fluids are constants, the higher the density of the drilling fluid is, the greater degree of invasion and hydrate dissociation are. The increased pore pressure caused by the mud invasion, endothermic cooling with hydrate dissociation compounded by the Joule-Thompson effect and lagged effect of heat transfer in sediments, together make water and gas forming secondary hydrates. The secondary hydrate together with existing hydrate probably makes the hydrate saturation higher than original hydrate saturation. This high saturation hydrate ring could be attributed to the displacement effect of mud invasion and the permeability reduction because of secondary hydrates forming. Under the same temperature and pressure of drilling fluids, the higher the salt concentration of the drilling fluid, the faster rate and greater degree of hydrate dissociation due to the stronger thermodynamic inhibition effect and heat transfer efficiency. The occurrence of high-saturation hydrate girdle band seems to mainly depend on the temperature and salinity of drilling fluids. The dissociated free gas, the dilution of water salinity associated with hydrate dissociation and the occurrence of high saturation hydrate ring probably cause the calculated hydrate saturation based on well logging is higher than that of actual hydrate-bearing sediments. Our simulations suggest that in order to keep wellbore stability and well logging accuracy during drilling through the hydrate-bearing sediment, it is better to adopt the managed pressure drilling and low-temperature mud circulation, and add kinetic inhibitors or anti-agglomerants instead of salts into drilling fluids for preventing hydrate re-formation in the well.",,,,,,,,,4,13,0,0,0,0,16,,,0001-5733,,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Geosci, Fac Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R ChinaUniv Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Earth Syst Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USABeijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Ctr Gas Hydrate Res, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China",,,,2013-03-13,WOS:000314480100021,,

The aim of this work was to estimate the reclamation-induced carbon loss in coastal wetlands using time series GF-1 WVF data. For this purpose, GF-1 WVF imageries of 2013 (before reclamation) and 2017 (after reclamation) in the Yangtze Estuary were collected and analyzed combined with field monitoring. Results showed that the converted coastal wetland area occupied up to 61.60% between 2013 and 2017. Carbon estimation indicated that the coastal wetland before reclamation had greater potential contribution to the global warming mitigation than the wetland reclamation to other land cover types. Finally the vulnerability of carbon stores and uncertain analysis with remote sensing technology in coastal wetlands environment were discussed. We emphasized that long-term monitoring of coastal wetlands and its carbon dynamic are urgently needed, because so many uncertain factors exist in short-term monitoring.",,,,,Conference on Remote Sensing and Modeling of Ecosystems for Sustainability XIVConference on Remote Sensing and Modeling of Ecosystems for Sustainability XIV,"AUG09, 2017AUG09, 2017",SPIESPIE,"San Diego, CASan Diego, CA",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0277-786X,1996-756X,978-1-5106-1268-6; 978-1-5106-1267-9,,,,,,,,,"East China Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R ChinaEast China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Yantai Inst Coastal Zone Res, Yantai 264003, Peoples R ChinaEast China Normal Univ, Joint Lab Environm Remote Sensing & Data Assimil, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R ChinaColorado State Univ, USDA UV B Monitoring & Res Program, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USAColorado State Univ, Ctr Remote Sensing & Modeling Agr Sustainabil, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",,,,2018-02-20,WOS:000424394500011,,

As an alternative to flaring, the gaseous by-products are already being captured by some refineries and are utilised for their energy content. However, viability. of flare gas recovery projects is restricted in many countries by high project development costs, lack of funding and energy subsidies. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) can play a pivotal role in overcoming barriers facing flare gas recovery projects in developing countries like Egypt, especially in view of the low energy prices due to energy subsidies provided by the government. This paper reports on research conducted on Egypt's first refinery flare gas recovery project, which could improve sustainability and promote Cleaner Production within the Egyptian Oil & Gas industry. Since the project was foreseen for implementation under CDM, the project was analysed from a triple bottom line perspective. In addition to the potential annual greenhouse gas emission reductions yielding expected yearly revenues of around USD 1.5 million, the project can contribute to capacity building and employment opportunities in Egypt's Oil & Gas industry. Registering the project under CDM improves its economic feasibility and can provide impetus to overcome the identified project barriers. However, since the project's Internal Rate of Return is highly sensitive to the local gas price, removing the energy subsidies renders the project economically attractive without considering CDM revenues. From a future perspective, this project represents a major steppingstone for implementing zero flaring in Egypt. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The recruitment of juveniles in the NPO has shown fluctuations in recent decades: this has been attributed to variations in the spawning stock biomass (SSB) and to the oceanographic conditions within the California Current system (CCS). In this study, these hypotheses are tested by fitting three different stock-recruitment (SR) functions into different models using data of recruit-recruitment and SSB of Pacific sardine in three regions of the NPO: Magdalena Bay (MB), Ensenada (EN), and north Pacific (NP). To quantify the plausibility of each model, given the data and the set of three models, the Akaike weight of each model was calculated. The selection of the best model within each area was done by minimizing the small-sample, bias-corrected form of the Akaike information criterion. Through this approach, the MB and EN fisheries fitted both the asymptotic Beverton-Holt and dome-shaped Ricker models. These results agreed with prior evidence that recruitment of Pacific sardine has a density-dependent mortality term for eggs and juvenile stages, related to the total SSB and cohort size. To test environmental influence on sardine recruitment principal component analysis was undertaken. The first principal component group was determined by El Nino-La Nina episodes; the second, by the upwelling index. Upon incorporation of these principal components into the SR models, the recruitment of the sardine throughout the CCS was differentially affected, e.g., warm episodes in MB negatively affected recruitment, whereas in the EN and NP regions, the effect was positive.

For monitoring programs that have not established standard statistical procedures, an evaluation of models' abilities to measure change over a range of scenarios is vital to develop best practices for analyzing monitoring data. A comprehensive evaluation was developed and applied using Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) tidal turbine site as a case study of a developing industry with no standard monitoring methods. Before-After monitoring datasets that contained change were simulated using normal and non-normal empirical baseline data collected at a MRE site. Thirteen regression models from three classes were evaluated: 6 generalized regression models, 4 time series models, and 3 non parametric models. Intervention Analysis was used to fit models to five change scenarios that included three amplitudes of change and a lag in the onset of change. A power analysis was used to evaluate model ability to detect change. Residual error diagnostics were used to quantify model fit and forecast accuracy. Parametric models that did not include lagged dependent variables were the most capable at detecting change. A comparison of the fit and forecast metric results indicated that deterministic time series models in conjunction with semi-parametric generalized regression models provided a robust and informative quantification of change. Nonparametric models most accurately forecasted change. The results provide insight on model behavior, which is used to recommend specific models to measure change in the case study data.

Here we analyse the intended and unintended effects of one specific geoengineering approach, which is enhanced weathering via the open ocean dissolution of the silicate-containing mineral olivine. This approach would not only reduce atmospheric CO2 and oppose surface ocean acidification, but would also impact on marine biology. If dissolved in the surface ocean, olivine sequesters 0.28 g carbon per g of olivine dissolved, similar to land-based enhanced weathering. Silicic acid input, a byproduct of the olivine dissolution, alters marine biology because silicate is in certain areas the limiting nutrient for diatoms. As a consequence, our model predicts a shift in phytoplankton species composition towards diatoms, altering the biological carbon pumps. Enhanced olivine dissolution, both on land and in the ocean, therefore needs to be considered as ocean fertilization. From dissolution kinetics we calculate that only olivine particles with a grain size of the order of 1 mu m sink slowly enough to enable a nearly complete dissolution. The energy consumption for grinding to this small size might reduce the carbon sequestration efficiency by similar to 30%.",,,,,,,,,82,4,0,0,20,0,88,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res AWI, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany",,,,2013-05-15,WOS:000316998300017,,

Offshore day shifts lasted from 07:00 - 19:00 h. Fatigue was measured objectively with pre- and post-shift scores of the 3-minute psychomotor vigilance tasks (PVT-B) parameters (reaction times, number of lapses, errors and false starts) and subjectively with pre-and post-shift Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) ratings. Evening saliva samples were collected on offshore days 2,7 and 13 to measure circadian rhythm markers such as dim-light melatonin onset times and cortisol. Generalized and linear mixed model analyses were used to examine daily fatigue scores over time.Results: Complete data from N = 42 offshore day shift workers was analyzed. Daily parameters of objective fatigue, PVT-B scores (reaction times, average number of lapses, errors and false starts), remained stable over the course of the two-week offshore day shifts. Daily subjective post-shift fatigue scores significantly increased over the course of the two-week offshore shifts. Each day offshore was associated with an increased post-shift subjective fatigue score of 0.06 points (95%CI:.03-.09 p < .001). No significant statistical differences in subjective pre-shift fatigue scores were found. Neither a circadian rhythm phase shift of melatonin nor an effect on the pattern and levels of evening cortisol was found.Conclusion: Daily parameters of objective fatigue scores remained stable over the course of the two-week offshore day shifts. Daily subjective post-shift fatigue scores significantly increased over the course of the two-week offshore shifts. No significant changes in circadian rhythm markers were found.

Both Corexit dispersants enhanced photodegradation of pyrene, while SPC1000 slightly inhibited the reaction. Span 80 and Tween 85 were the key ingredients causing the effects, though the underlying mechanisms differed. Span 80 enriches pyrene in the upper layer of water column, whereas Tween 85 induces a photosensitization process. Two reactive oxygen species, O-1(2) and O-2(center dot-), were found responsible for pyrene photodegradation, though the presence of EC9500A suppressed the O-1(2) pathway. In terms of photodegradation products, EC9500A enhanced generation of polyaromatic intermediates, i.e., phenaleno[1,9-cd][1,2]dioxine, 1-hydroxypyrene, and 1,8-pyrenequinone, but did not alter the classical photodegradation pathway.

To ensure the economic efficiency of operations under such complicated conditions, industrial solutions called smart fields were introduced. A vital part of these solutions is strategic planning which aims to coordinate field development and hydrocarbons production operations to optimize the entire field lifecycle, given the chosen planning criterion (e.g., net present value of the project). Still, in many cases engineering design is conducted with a conservative approach of solving one problem at a time. In this study, a multi-period mixed integer nonlinear problem (MINLP) covering the relevant issues of both development and production phases, is introduced. The contribution of the proposed model to the area of oilfield development planning is related to the model's simultaneously incorporating technological details regarding the infrastructure layout, pressures and flows in the gathering system, and artificial lift performance, all of which ultimately aims to provide realistic production scheduling results and cost evaluation. The composed model is used to study the benefits of joint development and production planning in comparison to planning these two phases of the project separately. This research is relevant to the engineering design departments and contractors for the preliminary design stage of the engineering project when the infrastructures layout and capacities are chosen, and rough estimates of costs and revenues are calculated.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,0,11,,,0920-4105,1873-4715,,,,,,,,,,"Molde Univ Coll, POB 2110, N-6402 Molde, Norway",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000414179100047,,

Here, we review what advances were made in scientific understanding of quantification of flow rates during deep sea oil well blowouts. We assess the degree to which a consensus was reached on the flow rate of the well by comparing in situ observations of the leaking well with a time-dependent flow rate model derived from pressure readings taken after the Macondo well was shut in for the well integrity test. Model simulations also proved valuable for predicting the effect of partial deployment of the blowout preventer rams on flow rate. Taken together, the scientific analyses support flow rates in the range of similar to 50,000-70,000 barrels/d, perhaps modestly decreasing over the duration of the oil spill, for a total release of similar to 5.0 million barrels of oil, not accounting for BP's collection effort. By quantifying the amount of oil at different locations (wellhead, ocean surface, and atmosphere), we conclude that just over 2 million barrels of oil (after accounting for containment) and all of the released methane remained in the deep sea. By better understanding the fate of the hydrocarbons, the total discharge can be partitioned into separate components that pose threats to deep sea vs. coastal ecosystems, allowing responders in future events to scale their actions accordingly.",,,,,,,,,383,6,0,0,235,0,463,,,0027-8424,,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Off Director, Reston, VA 20192 USAWoods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Appl Ocean Phys & Engn, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USAColumbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USAUS DOE, Natl Energy Technol Lab, Pittsburgh, PA 15236 USAUS Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USANOAA, Div Chem Sci, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USAUniv Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,,2012-12-11,WOS:000312605600033,22187459,

Significant decline in abundance of bigfin squid and destruction of suitable substrates for spawning of neritic squids in coastal waters of Northeast Taiwan has been noted by local fishermen in recent years. Local divers arbitrarily deployed bamboo clusters as a squid aggregation device, for mating and spawning, in order to restore the abundance of squid. The deployment of the devices was not approved by the government, in particular the fishery authorities. Following conflict and compromises, the bamboo clusters were placed in restricted regions with permission from the local government. However, the interim management measure faced a serious challenge. The fishing activity of fishermen and recreational anglers, who were not consulted for the interim measure, targeted the aggregated squids putting them at risk. To prevent hazards, a theoretical management model was proposed to involve and direct essential stakeholders in conservation and sustainable utilization of the resource. A fishbone diagram and spiral model was created to analyze and illustrate the potential problems. Collaborative management tools were applied to coordinate the participants' duties and responsibilities and build the interrelationships between them. Finally, a modified management model based on adaptive management strategies was developed to cope with the changing situations. This modified management model process might further serve as an example for conservation and management measures of other fisheries resources. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a popular method to perform multi-attribute decision-making to solve this problem. In order to deal with vague information, various fuzzy AHP methods have been proposed. However, these methods suffer four serious limitations: (1) there is a tremendous computational requirement; (2) sometimes only triangular fuzzy numbers can be used; (3) adding or deleting criteria/attributes is not easy to operate in the algorithm; (4) inconsistent judgments is more likely to be expected with fuzzy numbers.This paper proposes a hybrid approach using fuzzy inference system (FIS) and fuzzy AHP which not only eliminates the above limitations but also serves as a robust tool for the prioritization of environmental issues in OOG operations. In this approach, a five-level hierarchy is developed. The highest level of the hierarchy corresponds to the goal - prioritization of significance of environmental issues, and the lowest level corresponds to environmental issues, whereas intermediate levels correspond to major concerns (environmental risks) and sub-parameters of risk. The FIS is applied at the lower levels of the hierarchy to infer the major risk parameters. After this, the scores representing the extent of risk are calculated. Fuzzy AHP is used at the higher levels to synthesize the Significance Scores that will help to prioritize environmental issues. An application of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a numerical example. (C) 2010 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are sensitive to the length (depth) scale over which respiration converts POC back to inorganic carbon, because shallower waters exchange with the atmosphere more rapidly than deeper ones. However, estimates of this carbon regeneration length scale and its spatiotemporal variability are limited, hindering the ability to characterize its sensitivity to environmental conditions. Here, we present a zonal section of POC fluxes at high vertical and spatial resolution from the GEOTRACES GP16 transect in the eastern tropical South Pacific, based on normalization to the radiogenic thorium isotope Th-230. We find shallower carbon regeneration length scales than previous estimates for the oligotrophic South Pacific gyre, indicating less efficient carbon transfer to the deep ocean. Carbon regeneration is strongly inhibited within suboxic waters near the Peru coast. Canonical Martin curve power laws inadequately capture POC flux profiles at suboxic stations. We instead fit these profiles using an exponential function with flux preserved at depth, finding shallow regeneration but high POC sequestration below 1,000 m. Both regeneration length scales and POC flux at depth closely track the depths at which oxygen concentrations approach zero. Our findings imply that climate warming will result in reduced ocean carbon storage due to expanding oligotrophic gyres, but opposing effects on ocean carbon storage from expanding suboxic waters will require modeling and future work to disentangle.",,,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,13,0,40,,,0027-8424,,,,,,,,,,,"Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USAColumbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY 10027 USAUniv Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USAUniv Hawaii Manoa, Daniel K Inouye Ctr Microbial Oceanog Res & Educ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USAUniv Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USAUniv Minnesota, Dept Earth Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USAXi An Jiao Tong Univ, Inst Global Environm Change, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,,,2019-06-04,WOS:000467804000016,31036647,

The number of sunken vessel discoveries has escalated in many of the seas of the world in response to the widespread application of these and other new tools. Customarily, surviving artifacts within the debris field of a wreck are collected and then moved to laboratories, centers, or institutions for analyses and possible conservation. Frequently, the conservation phase involves chemical treatments to stabilize an artefact to standard temperature, pressure, and humidity instead of an undersea environment. Many of the artefacts encountered at an underwater site are now characterized and restored in-situ in accordance with modern trends in art conservation. Two examples of this trend are exemplified by the resting place of the wreck of the Titanic in the Atlantic and the Cancun Underwater Park in the Caribbean Sea. These two debris fields have been turned into museums for diving visitors.Several research groups have investigated the possibility of adapting the well-established analytical tool Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) to in-situ elemental analyses of underwater cultural, historic, and archaeological artefacts where discovered, rather than as a phase of a salvage operation. As the underwater laser ablation associated with LIBS generates a snowplough shockwave within the aqueous matrix, the atomic emission spectrum is usually severely attenuated in escaping from the target. Consequently, probative experiments to date generally invoke a submerged air chamber or air jet to isolate water from the interaction zone as well as employ more complex double-pulse lasers. These measures impose severe logistical constraints on the examination of widely dispersed underwater artefacts. In order to overcome this constraint we report on water-immersion LIBS experiments performed with oblique laser irradiation and spectral detection at the complementary angle so as to view emission from behind the shockwave. Targets of silver, gold, and copper have been studied. It is found that this approach enables LIBS detection in water both in emission and in absorption. It appears that underwater inverse LIBS may be especially useful in underwater archaeology.",,,,,"Conference on Optics for Arts, Architecture, and Archaeology IVConference on Optics for Arts, Architecture, and Archaeology IV","MAY 15-16, 2013MAY 15-16, 2013",SPIESPIE,"Munich, GERMANYMunich, GERMANY",4,0,0,0,2,0,4,,,0277-786X,1996-756X,978-0-8194-9606-5,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Adv Nanotechnol, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USASt Petersburg State Electrotech Univ, St Petersburg, Russia",,,,2013-09-11,WOS:000323440000022,,

We aimed to assess the performance of the PAM system at an operational turbine, describe the 3D movements and behaviours of small cetaceans in the vicinity of the turbine, and model changes in detection rates against temporal and environmental variables. The PAM system was designed to acoustically detect, classify and track porpoises and dolphins via their vocalisations within a similar to 100 m radius of the turbine. In total, 247 small cetacean encounters were identified from click detections, which were also used to reconstruct the spatial movements of porpoises and dolphins, including close approaches to the turbine. Not all hydro phones were functional, which limited the ability to localise porpoise clicks; the probability of detecting and localising a click decreased by 50% at a range of similar to 20 m. Mechanical sounds on the turbine may have alerted cetaceans of its presence. In models examining acoustic detection patterns, the tidal state, time of day, low low-frequency noise levels and moon phase best explained the acoustic presence of porpoises. The limited duration of turbine operation yielded insufficient data to understand the effect of turbine rotation on animal presence and movement near the turbine.

This project, funded through the Department of Energy CarbonSAFE initiative, aims to characterize the potential storage capacity and preferential fluid-flow pathways through the Permian White Rim Sandstone on and near the San Rafael Swell, Utah, to assess the formation's viability as a possible CO2 sequestration reservoir. A diverse suite of sedimentological observations and diagenetic analyses was used to assess the White Rim Sandstone's reservoir potential, including detailed outcrop observations, facies descriptions and ichnology, measured stratigraphic sections with associated correlations, permeability measurements, thin-section petrography, and visible and near-infrared spectroscopy. Stratigraphically, the White Rim Sandstone has two major units separated by a marine transgressive surface. The lower eolian unit is characterized by decimeter- to meter-scale trough cross-bedded grain-flow and wind-ripple facies. The upper reworked, shallow-marine unit has a consistent set of facies at all three field sites: (1) soft-sediment deformation facies (e.g., contorted bedding or clastic pipes), (2) symmetric ripple laminations, (3) bioturbated (dominantly horizontal), and (4) bioturbated (dominantly vertical). This set of four facies represents the transgression of the Permian Kaibab sea over the Permian White Rim coastal dune field.The outcrop samples and subsurface core samples (similar to 1561-2243 m deep and similar to 33-50 km away from the outcrop localities) experienced different diagenetic fluid-flow histories that drastically impacted the reservoir properties. Outcrop samples have initial quartz overgrowth cements followed by rim-forming calcite cements, iron oxide cements, and occasional oil staining. In contrast, the core samples show significant compaction, followed by quartz overgrowth cementation and a later stage of patchy, large, pore-filling calcite cement that eliminated the porosity and permeability of the potential reservoir (<0.1 md). Outcrop permeability values tend to reflect textural differences in fades, particularly the presence and spacing of internal laminations and bounding surfaces. Fades with fewer internal laminations, such as the grainflow fades, have higher permeability values than fades with closely spaced internal laminae, such as the wind-ripple fades.

As regards HM resistance, the strains showed a high frequency (68%) of cadmium and/or copper resistance and uniform susceptibility to mercury. The prevalence of cadmium-resistant strains was significantly higher among erythromycin resistant than among erythromycin-susceptible strains. A significant association between cadmium or copper resistance and Q/D resistance was also observed at Estuarine site. The levels of the two HMs in sediment from all sites were fairly low, ranging from 0.070 to 0.126 mu g/g, for cadmium and from 1.00 to 7.64 mu g/g for copper. Mercury was always undetectable.

Criteria range from broadband levels to frequency weighted received sound levels. The associated differences in impact assessment results are, however, not yet understood. This uncertainty makes environmental management of transboundary anthropogenic noise challenging and causes confusion for regulators who need to choose appropriate exposure criteria. In the present study, three established exposure criteria frameworks from Germany, Denmark, and the US were used to analyse the effect of impact pile driving at a location in the Baltic Sea on harbor porpoise and harbor seal hearing. The acoustic modeling using MIKE showed that an unmitigated scenario would lead to auditory injury for all three criteria. Despite readily apparent variances in impact ranges among the applied approaches, it was also evident that noise mitigation measures could reduce underwater sound to levels where auditory injuries would be unlikely in most cases. It was concluded that each of the frameworks has its own advantages and disadvantages. Single noise exposure criteria follow the precautionary principle and can be enforced relatively easily, whereas criteria that consider hearing capabilities and animal response movement can improve the accuracy of the assessment if data are available.

As the crucial and most vulnerable connection of floating platform and subsea wellhead, the risers are of paramount importance in safe production test of the hydrate. Due to harsh environment and the possible drive off and drift off events induced by failure of dynamic positioning system of the platform, the unplanned emergency disconnect of risers is an integral preventive measure to avoid accidents and secure the well. Once the disconnect occurs, the huge potential energy stored in the riser column will release and consequently cause violent axial recoil, which will cause serious consequences if the recoil control fails. This paper presented a quantitative risk assessment approach on the basis of dynamic Bayesian networks to dynamically predict the risk of riser recoil control failure during production test of hydrate. By using the proposed method, the dynamic failure risk of the riser recoil control was figured out, and the most contributory factors were identified. The practical application of the proposed methodology was demonstrated through a case study. Results indicated that the probability of riser recoil control failure can be significantly decreased within one year through equipment repair, and the failure and repair rates of shutoff valves and main air isolation valves are the most contributory factors.

The conventional overbalanced drilling involves drilling of wells with mud which exerts higher hydrostatic bottom-hole pressure than the formation pore pressure. Unlike the conventional overbalanced drilling, underbalanced drilling involves designing the hydrostatic pressure of the drilling fluid to be lower than the pore pressure of the formation being drilled. During circulation, the equivalent circulating density is used to determine the bottom-hole pressure conditions. Due to lower hydrostatic pressure, underbalanced drilling portends higher safety risk than its alternatives of conventional overbalanced drilling and managed pressure drilling. The safety risk includes frequent kicks from the well and subsequent blowout with potential threat to human, equipments and the environment.Safety assessment and efficient control of well is critical to ensure a safe drilling operation. Traditionally, safety assessment is done using static failure probabilities of drilling components which failed to represent a specific case. However, in this present study, a dynamic safety assessment approach for is presented. This approach is based on Bow-tie analysis and real time barriers failure probability assessment of offshore drilling operations involving subsurface Blowout Preventer. The Bow-tie model is used to represent the potential accident scenarios, their causes and the associated consequences. Real time predictive models for the failure probabilities of key barriers are developed and used in conducting dynamic risk assessment of the drilling operations. Using real time observed data, potential accident probabilities and associated risks are updated and used for safety assessment. This methodology can be integrated into a real time risk monitoring device for field application during drilling operations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, our study sought to conduct a comprehensive geological study of the facies architecture and sediment inning processes in the intrabasinal slope belts of the Zhanhua Depression during the Paleogene using seismic data, drill cores and well logs. Three distinctive de-positional systems were identified: near-shore subaqueous fan, shallow/deep lakes, and braided-river delta. The facies architecture and sediment infilling processes were primarily characterized by different stages of diversiform tectonic geomorphologies in cyclothem motifs of rift lacustrine basins. The geomorphological characteristics of the Shahejie Formation exhibited multiple alternating uplifts and sags, resulting in multiple infra- and extra-basinal sediment provenances, while those of the Dongying Formation displayed a single depocenter with a wide and gentle geomorphology derived from several extra-basinal sediment provenances. Coarse-grained sediments formed near-shore subaqueous fans, primarily accumulated on the slopes around the Kenli Uplift during the member 3 of the Shehejie Formation interval; medium- and fine-grained sediments deposited in the proximal and distal environment of the delta front and sandy sediments formed thick-bedded sandy beach bars on subaqueous uplifts during member 2 of the Shehejie Formation interval; ultrafine-grained, fine-grained, and carbonate sediments deposited as thin-bedded carbonate banks and sandy beach bars in a shallow/deep lake during member 1 of the Shehejie Formation interval; and fine-to medium-grained sediments abundantly accumulated in the proximal environment of the delta front by passing the uplifts and infilling the slopes during the Dongying Formation interval.

We have achieved good results in removing various noise interferences and different types of multiple-wave interferences, especially the severe interference of marine turbulence in the survey area. Under the premise of amplitude-preserving treatment, the bubble is suppressed, the wavelet is compressed, and the resolution of the seismic data is improved. Using high-density velocity analysis, we performed anisotropic bi-spectral non-hyperbolic move-out correction, making the wave group features and amplitude characteristics more obvious. Through reasonable regularization of bins, the coverage folds are uniform and the lateral resolution is improved. For the densely-distributed 2D seismic data, a 3D pre-stack time migration processing method is adopted. In this study, the single-source, single-cable, long-streamer, seismic data with severe noise interference are processed in the way of 3D seismic data processing.

The samples taken out of the sea were examined visually and described. The changes in the physical, chemical and biological properties of the wood samples were investigated. The obtained results indicate noticeable, measurable changes in the oak wood submerged in the sea: 18-25% loss of wood mass, a decrease in bending strength and compression strength of up to 40-65% of the initial values. In addition, the following were noted: a clear change in wood colour and surface structure, an increase in the content of mineral substances, an increase in pH value, a decrease in the content of water-soluble substances and extractives (ethanol). The laboratory test with Basidiomycetes fungi has showed that wood became significantly more susceptible to the white-rot caused by Trametes versicolor than to brown-rot caused by Coniophora puteana fungus.

Simultaneous exposure to high temperature and high pCO(2) reduced shell strength, decreased outer shell density and increased total lipid content.

We assessed the impact on subtidal oyster populations of this novel oil spill response action using 3 independent methods: (1) comparison of fisheries-independent post-spill densities to a pre-spill temporal baseline; (2) comparison of oyster density collected during natural resource damage assessment sampling between the area of maximal freshwater impact and reference areas in the 2 basins; and (3) estimation from a dose-response model derived from an analysis of an in situ mark and recapture study conducted in 2010 to assess the relationship between salinity and oyster mortality. A substantial portion of both basins (483 km(2) of Barataria Bay and 362 km(2) of Black Bay/Breton Sound) experienced prolonged periods of very low (< 5 ppt) salinity in 2010 that lasted at least 1 mo longer than the average duration of low salinity between 2006 and 2009. The 3 approaches all indicate that dramatic losses occurred in the number of market-sized (> 75 mm) oysters as a result of a system-wide lowering of salinities, with an estimated 1.16 to 3.29 billion market-equivalent oysters lost. The efficacy of the large-scale response action of altering hydrographic conditions during the summer oyster growth period should be examined in light of the major perturbation to oyster communities.",,,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,23,0,32,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USADauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USANortheastern Univ, Marine Sci Ctr, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908 USAInd Econ Inc, 2067 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02140 USANewFields Inc, 1349 W Peachtree St,Suite 2000, Atlanta, GA 30309 USANOAA, Assessment & Restorat Div, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",NewFields Inc,,,2017-08-03,WOS:000407443900014,,

Hawksbill turtles Eretmochelys imbricata were also present. Analyses of 30 different islets that make up the atoll showed that the seabird species mostly partitioned their use of islets based on islet size, with four species preferring larger islets and two species preferring smaller islets. Alien species introduced historically are still present and other threats, such as shipwrecks, remain. We propose conservation and other measures that should adequately protect the birds, turtles and coral reef by treating the atoll as a system.

Most of the existing life extension decision-making models are restricted solely to either technical or economic feasibility analyses that may lead to inaccurate results or incorrect conclusions. In this paper, a comprehensive life extension feasibility assessment framework by taking into account both the technical and economic considerations is developed. The proposed techno-economic model for life extension of safety critical elements consists of three phases: preparation, assessment, and implementation. The technical assessment part of the framework incorporates all aspects of data collection and review, screening and prioritization of safety critical elements, condition assessment, estimation of remaining useful life, and risk analysis, while the economic assessment part deals with cost-benefit analysis. The decision to qualify a safety critical element for continuous operation beyond its service life is made based on a life extension measure (LEM) which is calculated by combining two indexes of equipment health condition and economic added-value obtained respectively from the technical and economic assessments. The model is applied to support the life extension decision-making procedure for water deluge systems in offshore oil installations. The results of the study show that the model is highly capable of assisting asset owners to evaluate the technical and economic benefits of extending the service life of components.

These and other intertidal communities are also extensive along the 7,400 km coastline of north-eastern Australia. Determination of their floristic composition, potential carbon (C) store and sequestration capacity, and vulnerability to climate extremes is required for their effective conservation management and was the aim of this study. Standardized, state-wide quantitative classification methods identified five mangrove forest and three saltmarsh communities covering 2,604 km(2)along this coastline. Estuarine and oceanic mangrove forests were mapped separately. Carbon storage and sequestration capacity of the intertidal communities and their vulnerability to strong El Nino events were estimated using published data and GIS analyses. An estimated potential 126.2 (+/- 27.3 SEM) Tg C and 8.3 (+/- 0.4 SD) Tg C were stored in the mangrove forests and saltmarshes, respectively. Comparatively, the rainforests of the region stored an estimated equivalent amount of C but covered three times the area, and the most widespread woodlands (Eucalyptus tetrodonta) of the region stored an estimated 1.5 times the C but covered 16 times the area. The C stored in the intertidal communities was estimated as equivalent to 493.47 Tg of CO(2,)valued at AU$6.8 billion on the Australian carbon market in December 2018. Annual C sequestration potential was 0.18-0.34 Tg C/year, valued between AU$8.9 and $17 million. Approximately 360 ha of mangrove forest was estimated as lost because of dieback during the 2015-16 El Nino event. Three types of mangrove forest were identified as potentially vulnerable to dieback from El Nino-driven climate events.

This work considers a new primary cooling for deepwaters offshore platforms based on deep seawater (DSW) intake at 4 degrees C from depths around 900 m, reducing the outlet temperature of intercoolers to 12 degrees C. DSW intake alternative is assessed in terms of power consumption, CO2 emissions and economy employing detailed equipment sizing and cost estimation. Depending on gas flow rate, it is shown that DSW intake lowers compressors power up to 9.2%, besides several indirect benefits: elimination of one CO2 compressor; 30% less heat transfer areas; 4.5% less fuel gas consumption; 4% less gas turbines power; 9.5% (15 MMUS$) less investment; 14.4% (226 t) less topside weight, while making refrigeration unnecessary for dew point adjustment.

The net carbon sink in the Chinese terrestrial ecosystem was 0.19-0.26 Pg C yr(-1) for the 1980s and 1990s. Both natural wetlands and the rice-paddy regions emitted 1.76 Tg and 6.62 Tg of CH4 per year for the periods 1995-2004 and 2005-2009, respectively. China emitted similar to 1.1 Tg N2O-N yr(-1) to the atmosphere in 2004. Land soil contained similar to 8.3 Pg N. The excess nitrogen stored in farmland of the Yangtze River basin reached 1.51 Tg N and 2.67 Tg N in 1980 and 1990, respectively. The outer Yangtze Estuary served as a moderate or significant sink of atmospheric CO2 except in autumn. Phytoplankton could take up carbon at a rate of 6.4x10(11) kg yr(-1) in the China Sea. The global ocean absorbed anthropogenic CO2 at the rates of 1.64 and 1.73 Pg C yr(-1) for two simulations in the 1990s. Land net ecosystem production in China would increase until the mid-21st century then would decrease gradually under future climate change scenarios. This research should be strengthened in the future, including collection of more observation data, measurement of the soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and sequestration, evaluation of changes in SOC in deep soil layers, and the impacts of grassland management, carbon-nitrogen coupled effects, and development and improvement of various component models and of the coupled carbon cycle-climate model.",,,,,,,,,8,4,0,0,2,0,9,,,0256-1530,1861-9533,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Atmospher Boundary Layer Phys & Atm, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",,,,2012-09-19,WOS:000307762100008,,

During the mid-late 2013, we deployed a NW-trending onshore-offshore profile in eastern Jiaodong Peninsula to reveal shallow-deep structural relationship, seismogenic environment and crustal structure in active faults of the Jiaodong Peninsula and its adjacent regions.The onshore-offshore seismic survey simultaneously received structural information from the upper mantle by terrestrial artificial source explosion, submarine detectors and the terrestrial seismic instruments. The artificial seismic exploration is one of creditable methods to obtain the relatively accurate deep crustal structure, which has the higher data resolution, the identified source location and reliable seismic phase. In order to suppress the interference and improve the signal-to-noise ratio of instruments, observation instruments are placed away from main traffic routes as far as possible. To obtain high-quality seismic data, we apply the seismic ray tracing method to calculation. First of all, we identify and read the wave group phase of shot points, then repeatedly modify the given initial velocity model to make the most effective fitting between the theoretical arrival time and the measured arrival time, and finally get the 2D deep velocity structure of seismic along the profile with the active source.From the obtained 2D velocity structure, we get following results: (1) Five sets of seismic phase, i. e. PG, P1, P2, P3, PM, are identified, of which PG, PM are the dominant wave groups with strong energy and continuous contrast tracking while other wave groups are relatively weak with the loss of some phase in some sections. (2) The study area can be divided into the upper crust and lower crust with the 02 interface as the boundary between the upper and lower crust and M interface being the boundary between crust and mantle. (3) The crustal structure in Jiaodong Peninsula is complex. The buried depth of the basement is shallow and the surface velocity is relatively high. The crustal velocity structure presents non-uniforin characters with horizontal stratification and longitudinal blocks. (4) Interface trending features of Cl and C2 are similar, showing gradually shallower from NW to SE with evident undulation in some sections. C3 interface only appears in the NW section and has not been found yet in the SE section. The M interface is deeper in the middle and shallow subsurface at both ends, and at the same time the thickness of the lower crust is thicker in the west and thin in the east. (5) As the important part of the Tanlu fault zone, the Muping-Jimo fault zone is a major fault zone in Jiaodong Peninsula. Crustal structures are obviously different on either side of this fault zone. The speed on the east is lower while higher on the west side, and layered interface of the crust also varies obviously on both sides. The crustal structure is shallower in SE and deeper in NW on the whole.Overall, structural differences in different sections of Jiaodong Peninsula are in line with the tectonic unit division. The regions with significant undulation at the interface coordinate with the fault zone through the surface from afar. As the collision edge zone between North China block and the Yangtze block, located on the onshore-offshore structure edge which is related with the subduction of Pacific plate to Eurasian plate, Jiaodong Peninsula is featured by complicated crustal structure due to the combined effects of two kinds of dynamic backgrounds. In the light of the distribution of the NNE-trending fault zone, the Pacific plate plays a more important role in the subduction of the Jiaodong peninsula.",,,,,,,,,21,22,0,0,0,0,36,,,0001-5733,,,,,,,,,,,"China Earthquake Adm, Geophys Explorat Ctr, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R ChinaState Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China",State Ocean Adm,,,2015-10-22,WOS:000362059900020,,

The proposed model modifications relax flow conditions, such that the model errors are reduced when the system deviates from normal operation. With the aim of a more realistic model, the cylindrical underflow apex was included in the oil droplet trajectory space. An estimation of the flow that recirculates inside in the hydrocyclone was introduced as this phenomenon has observed in multiple CFD models and research studies. The reduced computational load enabled the proposed model to be executed below 10ms, thus enabling the model to be used for model-based control. The original and the modified model are experimentally validated using a pilot plant.

This is particularly the case for agriculture, where soil loss is not only a source of pollution but impacts soil fertility and sustainability. In recent years, improved pasture management, rotational grazing and holistic management practices have been employed and it is generally believed that soil erosion has been reduced to acceptable levels. For many landscapes, there has been a lack of ecological diversity and trees have been planted or allowed to regrow to provide ecological services as well as provide shade and windbreaks. However, in many circumstances, observed grass cover is reduced leaving soil exposed. While these practices are well-accepted, there has been little assessment of their impact on soil erosion and general soil properties. Here, we examine a grazing (pasture) landscape typical of many on the east coast of Australia and calculate erosion rates using an environmental tracer. We find that with the current management practices the soil loss is relatively low ( < 5 tonnes/ha/yr). However, it is likely to be an order of magnitude greater than soil production rates. Regrowth trees maintained to provide shelter and ecological services did not result in higher soil loss despite observed and measured reduced ground cover both under and surrounding the tree plot.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,8,0,16,,,0016-7061,1872-6259,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, AustraliaUniv Newcastle, Sch Engn, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",,,,2020-03-02,WOS:000510804700007,,

OceanExplorer, a tool developed and used by SAIC, generates a Desktop Study (DTS) that includes the route position - including associated site specific data (e.g., topographic, seismic, bathymetric, etc.)- and the cable engineering information necessary to initiate the cable design and installation process. It is Desktop on-demand published and delivered on a web site. OceanExplorer's ability to refine elements of the initial Desktop Study as more site-specific information is identified makes it the ideal tool for the iterative process of route planning and cable design. SAIC has developed and is using OceanExplorer to conduct Desktop Studies for the telecommunications industry and government undersea cable projects. OceanExplorer also has significant potential application in the planning and design of pipeline routes for the oil and gas industry.OceanExplorer incorporates graphical displays of numerous site-specific elements that help determine the final position of the cable route. It automatically creates basemaps with global topography, seismicity, volcanism, coastlines, rivers, lakes, and political boundaries. It also can display global coverage for sediment thickness, crustal age and geological hazards. Because all of the supporting information is web based, the customer can link quickly to the desired level of detail. Information linked in the Desktop Study can include detailed bathymetric maps and nautical charts, geological hazards, existing and planned pipelines and cables, cable faults, oil and gas facilities, fisheries and permits requirements, maritime traffic, restricted areas and meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) data. METOC data can include regional oceanography, wind speed, monthly maps of wave height, tides and currents, percentage of gale winds, sea temperature at depth, and global vertical profile catalog of temperature, salinity, and sound velocity. The global topography used in the OceanExplorer basemap is state-of-the-art based on satellite altimetry observations. It combines worldwide bathymetry and topography coverage at two-minute spacing, a great improvement over previous sparse ship track coverage. The ease with which OceanExplorer incorporates information collected from various sources (using the most advanced databases) allows new site-specific information to be added to any Desktop Study as required.While being used to determine the cable route, OceanExplorer is also refining the cable design - producing straight-line diagrams (SLDs) that incorporate the site-specific data to output information on cable type, slack, and cable length. OceanExplorer calculates the cable design based on armor type versus depth specifications. Precise distance thresholds are calculated for armor transitions. The cable length computed by OceanExplorer includes geodetic horizontal distances from the route position list (RPL), along bottom distances draped on bathymetry, and a depth dependent slack factor applied to along-bottom distance to yield final cable distance.OceanExplorer's web based approach to cable route planning and design is an innovative and efficient method of accessing the most current site specific information available and applying it to the plan for the cable route and the cable engineering design. Once the desired geographic information and level of detail is determined, OceanExplorer creates completed and web ready RPL and SLD products.",,,,,MTS/IEEE Oceans Conference and Exhibition on Where Marine Science and Technology MeetMTS/IEEE Oceans Conference and Exhibition on Where Marine Science and Technology Meet,"SEP 11-14, 2000SEP 11-14, 2000",Marine Technol Soc; IEEE; OESMarine Technol Soc; IEEE; OES,"PROVIDENCE, RIPROVIDENCE, RI",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,0-7803-6552-6,,,,,,,,,"Sci Applicat Int Corp, Newport, RI 02840 USA",,,,2000-01-01,WOS:000166107400009,,

Organic geochemical analyses in previous studies indicated that the hydrocarbons migrated from deeper source rocks, likely of Jurassic age. In the Central Iran Basin, the Qom Formation is 1,200 m thick and is bounded by the Oligocene Lower Red Formation and the middle Miocene Upper Red Formation. In previous studies, the Qom Formation was divided into nine members designated from oldest to youngest: a, b, c(1) to c(4), d, e and f, of which e is 300 m thick and constitutes the main reservoir. Our study focused on a Qom section located in the Gooreh Berenji region of central Iran which is 294 m thick. The lower part of the, formation was not deposited, and only the following four members of early Miocene age (Aquitanian and Burdigalian) were identified between the Lower and Upper Red formations: c(2)? (mainly greyish to greenish gypsiferous marls); d (thin- to thick-bedded anhydrite with intercalation of thin-bedded sandstone); e (argillaceous or sandy limestone); and f (fine-grained coral and bryozoan boundstone). In contrast to the Central Iran Basin, the e member in Gooreh Berenji is only 15 m thick and does not have a good reservoir potential.A detailed petrographic analysis of the Gooreh Berenji section resulted in the identification of 13 microfacies (MF) that were interpreted in terms of their depositional environments according to the following categories: MF1(sabkha), MF2 (intertidal river channel), MF3 (lower intertidal), MF4 (peritidal), MF5 (supratidal), MF6 and MF7 (shallow restricted lagoon), MF8 and MF10 (proximal open-marine), MF9 (leeward lagoon), MF11 (shoal), MF12 (reef and patch reef formed within lagoon), and MF13 (open-marine). The Qom Formation constitutes a regional transgressive-regressive sequence that is bounded by two continental units (Lower and Upper Red formations). The transgression started from the south in the late Oligocene and by the early Miocene the sea covered all of central Iran. In the Gooreh Berenji area, carbonate deposition occurred on a shallow-marine ramp.

This type of sand production was seen from the producing interval over turbidite strata during the 2013 gas hydrate trial at the Daini-Atsumi Knoll, Nankai Trough, offshore Japan. To investigate this sand production, an apparatus was designed to simulate a plane-strain case of sand production in the openhole gravel packed hydrate production well. Two scenarios of turbidite strata grainsize and layering were tested in the apparatus. The results of these sand production experiments suggest that the layering and grain size variations of the turbidites encourages sanding. The sand production preferentially came from specific layers in the turbidite sequence. This behaviour was explained by the development of shear induced negative excess pore pressure in the silt layer in undrained conditions which created a slab effect and encouraged the creation of a high permeability zone below the layer. The increase in permeability and fluid flow velocity in this zone increased the carrying capacity of the fluid flow.

The presented pore-scale morphology and growth patterns of gas hydrate are expected in natural sediment settings where free gas is available for hydrate formation, such as active gas vents, gas seeps, mud volcanoes, permafrost gas hydrate provinces, and CO2 injected formation for the sake of geologic carbon storage; and in laboratory hydrate samples synthesized from partially brine-saturated sediments or formed from water-gas interfaces.",,,,,,,,,69,6,0,0,4,0,73,,,1525-2027,,,,,,,,,,,"Washington State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Pullman, WA 99164 USAYonsei Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 120749, South KoreaWashington State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Pullman, WA 99164 USAKorea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Taejon 305701, South Korea",,,,2015-03-01,WOS:000353656200020,,

As one of the key elements of the PWT facilities, the hydrocyclone systems, are responsible for removing the remaining hydrocarbon content in the produced water before the treated water can be discharged, disposed, or reused as injection water. The hydrocyclone's performance heavily correlates with a number of system's and operational parameters, as well as dedicated control strategies. However, these correlations haven't yet been clearly explored from a control oriented point of view, due to the complex separation dynamics inside the cyclone systems. This work investigates and evaluates the hydrocyclone system's operational performance with respect to the most commonly used control paradigm, Pressure Drop Ratio (PDR) control, based on a lab-scaled pilot plant. It has been clearly observed that in many situations the PDR is not consistently related to the system efficiency or to the inlet flow-rates, however these are assumed consistent in almost all available studies and control designs. In addition, the dynamic responses of PDR and de-oiling efficiency (measured in terms of Oil-in-Water (OiW) concentration) of the deployed hydrocyclone systems are systematically and experimentally studied in this paper. This data can be used to derive control-oriented dynamic models of the considered system, so that a control solution that is better than the current PID-based PDR control, could be developed based on those models.",,,,,43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON),"OCT 29-NOV 01, 2017OCT 29-NOV 01, 2017","IEEE Ind Eect Soc; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; Chinese Assoc Automat; Syst Engn Soc China; Chinese Power Supply Soc; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Chinese Acad Sci; Chinese Electrotechn Soc; Beihang Univ Sch, Reliabil & Syst Engn; RMIT Univ; Beijing JiaoTong Univ; China Soc Ind & Appl Math; TaiPEAIEEE Ind Eect Soc; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; Chinese Assoc Automat; Syst Engn Soc China; Chinese Power Supply Soc; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Chinese Acad Sci; Chinese Electrotechn Soc; Beihang Univ Sch, Reliabil & Syst Engn; RMIT Univ; Beijing JiaoTong Univ; China Soc Ind & Appl Math; TaiPEA","Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing, PEOPLES R CHINA",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1553-572X,,978-1-5386-1127-2,,,,,,,,,"Aalborg Univ, Dept Energy Technol, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark",,,,2018-04-13,WOS:000427164806131,,

We introduce a probabilistic framework, based on a general food web approach, to analyze ecological impacts of oil spills. We argue that the food web approach based on key functional groups is more appropriate for providing holistic view of the involved risks than assessments based on single species. We discuss the issues characteristic to the Arctic that need a special attention in risk assessment, and provide examples how to proceed towards quantitative risk estimates.

The adopted design approach have been to allow exposed pipeline buckles globally on seabed in a safe and controlled manner. Otherwise, the walking phenomenon has been in general mitigated constraining axial displacements by means of anchoring systems.After several design and installation challenges concerning lateral buckling and pipeline walking behaviors, nowadays there is a significant amount of deepwater pipelines operating with buckle initiators (triggers) as well as walking mitigation devices in offshore Brazil. Oil and gas pipelines, short gathering lines and long export lines, installed by reeling and J-lay methods, in other words different kinds of subsea pipelines have operated on very soft clayey soils and have formed planned lateral buckles as well as rogue buckles.This paper presents the main characteristics and design challenges of the deepwater pipelines subjected to the lateral buckling behavior, also highlighting mitigation measures to constrain the walking phenomenon of some pipelines. The relevant design results are highlighted as type and number of buckle triggers, buckle spacing, type and locations of walking mitigations.

However, there are several potential hazards associated with their production and development. These are classified into four categories by this paper: marine geohazards, greenhouse gas emissions, marine ecological hazards, and marine engineering hazards. In order to prevent these risks from occurring, the concept of lifecycle management of hazards prevention during the development and production from MGHs is proposed and divided into three stages: preparation, production control, and post-production protection. Of these stages, economic evaluation of the resource is the foundation; gas production methods are the key; with monitoring, assessment, and early warning as the guarantee. A production test in the Shenhu area of the South China Sea shows that MGH exploration and development can be planned using the three-steps methodology: commercializing and developing research ideas in the short term, maintaining economic levels of production in the medium term, and forming a global forum to discuss effective MGH development in the long term. When increasing MGH development is combined with the lifecycle management of hazards prevention system, and technological innovations are combined with global cooperation to solve the risks associated with MGH development, then safe access to a new source of clean energy may be obtained.",,,,,,,,,26,5,0,0,2,0,30,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Min & Technol, State Key Lab Coal Resources & Safe Min, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Min & Technol, Key Lab Deep Coal Resource Min, Minist Educ China, Sch Mines, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000446604500205,,

Marine geo-engineering activities which are climate geo-engineering activities conducted at sea aim to reduce global warming while it can negatively impact on marine environment. International rules to govern the activities are urgently needed and the London Convention/Protocol is one of a few international legal instruments which have developed rules to manage pollution caused by marine geo-engineering activities.Considering the express purpose of the London Convention/Protocol which is to conserve marine environment through managing ocean dumping and incineration of waste or other matters and the fact that the traditional concept of ocean dumping had not included marine geo-engineering activities, it can be argued that management of marine geo-engineering activities under the London Protocol is ultra vires. This paper mainly aims to review whether the recent attempt to manage the activities under the London Protocol would be ultra vires or not. In advance of reviewing this, this paper first introduces the examples of marine geo-engineering activities including ocean fertilization and the most recent attempt to amend the Protocol to govern the activities under it.A function of an international institution would be ultra vires if it is beyond the powers given under the treaty establishing the institution. The scope of the powers can be different depending on sources of treaty interpretation(as stipulated in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties).Opponents to the amendment of the London Protocol for the management of geo-engineering activities argue that there is no express provision which gives the governing bodies meetings to the Protocol powers to deal with the activities, and that the options of the amendment are not consistent with existing international law, in particular, rules on rights and duties of coastal States, port States, and flag States within their jurisdictional waters stipulated in the Law of the Sea Convention. In other words, according to the opponents, the governing bodies meetings of the London Protocol do not have express powers and inherent powers to deal with the activities. This paper confirms that the meetings have implied powers and customary powers to regulate marine geo-engineering activities based on interpretation of Article 1 and 2 of the Protocol and recent practices. It also reviewed that the draft amendment is not inconsistent with the relevant provisions in the Law of the Sea Convention. It concludes that the extension of institutional powers to govern marine geo-engineering activities under the London Protocol would not be ultra vires.",,,,"인공적으로 배출되는 온실가스 특히 이산화탄소로 인한 지구온난화를 경감시킨다는 명분으로 개발 시행되는 해양지구공학 활동은 그러나 해양환경에 해로운 영향을 미칠 것으로도 예측되는 바, 이들 활동의 국제적 관리 규범이 확립될 필요가 있다. 이러한 필요성에 부응하여 폐기물 또는 기타 물질의 해양투기로 인한 해양오염을 방지할 목적으로 설립된 런던협약/의정서 당사국회의는 최근 해양지구공학 활동 전반을 관리할 규정을 추가하기 위한 개정을 논의 중이다.그러나, 런던의정서의 설립 목적과, 주요 관리 대상인 해양투기의 일반적인 개념을 고려하면 최근 의정서 개정 논의는 자칫 해당 조약의 권한 이상을 행사하는 월권행위인 것으로 오인받을 여지가 있다. 이 논문은 그러한 의정서 개정 시도가 국제기구의 월권행위에 해당하는지를 고찰할 목적으로 쓰였다. 월권행위 여부 검토하기 이전에 우선 이 논문은 해양지구공학 활동의 국제적 관리의 필요성과 최근 런던의정서 내의 그러한 관리 시도 내용을 검토하였다.국제기구의 월권행위는 해당 기구가 갖는 권한의 한계 이상으로 기능을 행사하였을 경우에 인정될 수 있는데, 국제기구의 권한은 국제기구법에 따르면 조약에 명시된 권한 이상으로 행사될 수 있다. 그러한 국제기구 권한의 확장은 조약의 해석을 통해 기능을 추가함으로써 이루어지므로 조약법에 관한 비엔나 협약 제31조의 조약 해석 규정과도 연계된다.런던의정서가 해양지구공학 활동 관리를 위하여 개정되는 것을 반대하는 국가들은 특히 런던의정서 당사국회의가 해당 활동을 관리할 명시적 규정이 없음과, 개정안이 관련 국제법 특히 해양법 규정과 불일치함 때문에 의정서 이행기구는 해당 활동을 관리할 권한이 없음을 주장하였다. 이러한 주장은 곧 의정서 당사국회의가 그러한 기능을 행사할 명시적 권한 없음 및 본연의 권한 없음을 주장한 것과 같다. 이 논문은 명시적 권한이 결여된 경우 기능의 확장을 정당화 할 수 있는 함축적 권한과 관습적 권한이 금번 개정 시도와 관련하여 런던의정서 당사국회의에 주어질 수 있음을 확인하였고, 본연의 권한에 근거하여 그러한 기능을 행사하는 데에도 문제가 없다는 것을 확인하였다. 이와 같이 최근 개정 시도가 국제기구 권한 이론에 따라 주어질 수 있는 권한의 한계 이내에서 행사되는 것으로 볼 수 있으므로 해당 개정이 월권행위인 것은 아니라고 결론지었다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1226-2994,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014-03-13,KJD:ART001760227,,

It directly affects the integrity of the pipeline which further leads to cracks and leakages. At present, subsea visual inspection and monitoring is performed by trained human divers; however, offshore infrastructures are moving from shallow to deep waters due to exhaustion of fossil fuels. Therefore, inhospitable underwater environmental conditions for human diver demand imaging-based robotic solution as an alternate for visual inspection and monitoring of subsea pipelines. However, an unfriendly medium is a challenge for underwater imaging-based inspection and monitoring activities due to absorption and scattering of light that further leads to blur, color attenuation, and low contrast. This paper presents a new method for subsea pipeline corrosion estimation by using color information of corroded pipe. As precursor steps, an image restoration and enhancement algorithm are developed for degraded underwater images. The developed algorithm minimizes blurring effects and enhances color and contrast of the images. The enhanced colors in the imaging data help in corrosion estimation process. The image restoration and enhancement algorithm are tested on both experimentally collected as well as publicly available hazy underwater images. A reasonable accuracy is achieved in corrosion estimation that helped to distinguish between corroded and non-corroded surface areas of corroded pipes.

Halomonas was fermented, which contained 76% PHB on cell dry weight. The fish juveniles were fed formulated feeds containing 1% HM.PHB, 3% HM.PHB and 5% HM.PHB, and 3% particle PHB (Par. PHB) and 3% Halomonas containing no PHB (HM) for 6 weeks. The basal feed feeding was considered as the control. The results revealed that both Halomonas-PHB and particle PHB significantly improved the survival and growth of the juveniles than the control (p < .05), while HM was in between. When challenged with V. anguillarum, the survival rate in 1% HM.PHB, 3% HM.PHB and 5% HM.PHB was significantly improved than the control. Moreover, the increased intestine fold, epithelium height and surface were also observed in 3% HM.PHB. PCoA based on high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragment indicated that dietary Halomonas-PHB and particle PHB modified and stabilized the intestine microbial community of the fish. Our study demonstrated that Halomonas-PHB is an effective feed additive for C. semilaevis juvenile culture. The outcome of this study facilitates the application of Hatomonas-PHB in C. semilaevis and other marine fish aquaculture.",,,,,,,,,4,1,0,0,2,0,4,,,1355-557X,1365-2109,,,,,,,,,,"Tianjin Univ Sci & Technol, Asian Reg Artemia Reference Ctr, Tianjin Key Lab Marine Resources & Chem, Tianjin, Peoples R China",,,,2020-08-19,WOS:000557260100001,,

Bioremediation using oil-degrading bacteria has emerged as a promising green cleanup alternative in more recent years. The employment of biosurfactant-producing and hydrocarbon utilizing indigenous bacteria enhances the effectiveness of bioremediation by making hydrocarbons bioavailable for degradation. In this study, the best candidates of biosurfactant-producing indigenous bacteria were selected by screening of biochemical tests. The selected bacteria include Bacillus algicola (003-Phel), Rhodococcus soli (102-Na5), Isoptericola chiayiensis (103-Na4), and Pseudoalteromonas agarivorans (SDRB-Py1). In general, these isolated species caused low surface tension values (33.9-41.3 mN m(-1)), high oil spreading (1.2-2.4 cm), and hydrocarbon emulsification (up to 65%) warranting active degradation of hydrocarbons. FT-IR and LC-MS analyses indicated that the monorhamnolipid (RhaC(16:1)) and dirhamnolipid (Rha-Rha-C-6-C-6:1) were commonly produced by the bacteria as potent biosurfactants. The residual crude oil after the biodegradation test was quantitated using GC-MS analysis. The bacteria utilized crude oil as their sole carbon source while the amount of residual crude oil significantly decreased. In addition the cell-free broth containing biosurfactants produced by bacterial strains significantly desorbed crude oil in oil-polluted marine sediment. The selected bacteria might hold additional capacity in crude oil degradation. Biosurfactant-producing indigenous bacteria therefore degrade crude oil hydrocarbon compounds, produce biosurfactants that can increase the emulsification of crude oil and are thus more conducive to the degradation of crude oil.

As FKCC trains the 21st Century workforce for green energy, conducts research to harness the surrounding renewable energy resources and develops a global network devoted to fostering the renewable energy industry, the Engineering Technology Alternative Energy Technicians (ET-AET) program will be at the epicenter. The proposed two year training and research program will join a network of other regional engineering technology programs that will maximize transferability while using unique research opportunities as a training tool for wind, solar and tidal energy. The College has extraordinary infrastructure that makes it perfectly suited for renewable energy training, including a 17,000 square meter lagoon that will be used as a tidal energy simulation laboratory (TESLA). The TESLA facility will allow FKCC to participate in ground breaking tidal energy research by testing prototype tidal energy devices in a controlled yet natural marine environment.

Furthermore, gas reserves-rich nations are also showing a keen interest in exploring new gas markets to boost their exports and, in the process, provide a solution to the energy scarcity of other parts of the world.The two factors mentioned above- the need for newer energy reserves and the urge to tap new energy markets- coupled with the safety, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of pipelines have contributed to the growing number of deepwater gas pipeline projects being executed around the world.Deepwater Pipelines per se is not a new concept.

Next, the study compares and contrasts scuba with operations aboard an aircraft carrier, two different maritime scenarios, yet similar in that there are many hazards that may require split-second decisions with limited or no communication with others. Both these mind-sets and training approaches have direct application to leadership and disaster planning on a large ship by being focused on minimizing decisions under stress in order to reduce panic.FindingsThis study demonstrates the value and impact of training that minimizes decisions under stress and enable people to make decisions independently in the face of a loss of communications.

A major research challenge for numerical simulations of field-scale MHK farms stems from the large disparity in scales between the size of waterway and the energy harvesting device. We propose a large-eddy simulation (LES) framework to perform high-fidelity, multiresolution simulations of MHK arrays in a real-life marine environment using a novel unstructured Cartesian flow solver coupled with a sharp-interface immersed boundary method. The potential of the method as a powerful engineering design tool is demonstrated by applying it to simulate a 30 turbine MHK array under development in the East River in New York City. A virtual model of the MHK power plant is reconstructed from high-resolution bathymetry measurements in the East River and the 30 turbines placed in 10 TriFrame arrangements as designed by Verdant Power. A locally refined, near the individual turbines, background unstructured Cartesian grid enables LES across a range of geometric scales of relevance spanning approximately 5 orders of magnitude. The simulated flow field is compared with a baseline LES of the flow in the East River without turbines. While velocity deficits and increased levels of turbulence kinetic energy are observed in the vicinity of the turbine wakes, away from the turbines as well as on the water surface only a small increase in mean momentum is found. Therefore, our results point to the conclusion that MHK energy harvesting from large rivers is possible without a significant disruption of the river flow.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,,,0043-1397,1944-7973,,,,,,,,,,"Argonne Natl Lab, Math & Comp Sci Div, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USAUniv Chicago, Flash Ctr Computat Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USASUNY Stony Brook, Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USAVerdant Power Inc, New York, NY USAUniv Minnesota, Dept Mech Engn, St Anthony Falls Lab, 111 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Verdant Power Inc,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000456949300010,,

Due to this, performing routine pipeline inspections to detect any critical damage is extremely important for offshore projects and also to the environment. In-line inspection (ILI) of a pipeline is the process of inspecting the condition of a pipeline. There are various types of tools that can be used to perform ILI services, namely Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL), Multichannel Caliper, ultrasound, radio waves, and even inertial forces. This study focuses on data analysis methods collected by the Multichannel Caliper tool for anomalies detection. The Caliper tool is a mechanism that is used to measure the roundness of the internal pipeline to detect areas of crushing or other deformation. There are a number of companies available these days that offer pipeline inspection services. Most of them spend days to process a single data of the inspected pipeline. The results produced are sometimes inaccurate, inconsistent due to human carelessness, require a lot of human intervention, take a long time to analyze as well as certain parts of the data may fail to be noticed.

I here analyze ocean alkalinization in a high CO2 world (emission scenario SSP5-85-EXT++ and CDR-ocean-alk within CDRMIP) for the next millennia using a revised version of the carbon cycle model BICYCLE, whose long-term feedbacks are calculated for the next 1 million years. The applied model version not only captures atmosphere, ocean, and a constant marine and terrestrial biosphere, but also represents solid Earth processes, such as deep ocean CaCO3 accumulation and dissolution, volcanic CO2 outgassing, and continental weathering. In the applied negative emission experiment, 0.14 Pmol/yr of alkalinity-comparable to the dissolution of 5 Pg of olivine per year-is entering the surface ocean starting in year 2020 for either 50 or 5000 years. I find that the cumulative emissions of 6,740 PgC emitted until year 2350 lead to a peak atmospheric CO2 concentration of nearly 2,400 ppm in year 2326, which is reduced by only 200 ppm by the alkalinization experiment. Atmospheric CO2 is brought down to 400 or 300 ppm after 2730 or 3480 years of alkalinization, respectively. Such low CO2 concentrations are reached without ocean alkalinization only after several hundreds of thousands of years, when the feedbacks from weathering and sediments bring the part of the anthropogenic emissions that stays in the atmosphere (the so-called airborne fraction) below 4%. The efficiency of carbon sequestration by this alkalinization approach peaks at 9.7 PgC per Pmol of alkalinity added during times of maximum anthropogenic CO2 emissions and slowly declines to half this value 2000 years later due to the non-linear marine chemistry response and ocean-sediment processes. In other words, ocean alkalinization sequesters carbon only as long as the added alkalinity stays in the ocean. To understand the basic model behavior, I analytically explain why in the simulation results a linear relationship in the transient climate response (TCR) to cumulative emissions is found for low emissions (similarly as for more complex climate models), which evolves for high emissions to a non-linear relation.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,,2624-9553,,,,,,,,,,"Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforschung AWI, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany",,,,2020-12-09,WOS:001023188900001,,

On 6 February 2009 and following an initial FEED study, the contract was awarded to Heerema Fabrication Group (Main Contractor and Fabricator), in partnership with Iv-Oil & Gas (Designer and Procurer of process equipment) and SPT Offshore (Installation Contractor and Foundation Designer). The platform weighed in total 8,800 ton, including a 4,000 ton deck and 4,800 ton substructure including the suction pile foundation. The water depth at the F3FA site is 41m and the bottom of the cellar deck is located at 20m above LAT. The platform has an overall dimension of 63m x 45m footprint and protrudes some 90m above the seabed (excluding vent stack). The platform concept consists basically of a deck of 5 levels supported by 4 unbraced legs (3.25m outside diameter x 77m long) and founded on 4 huge suction piles (15m outside diameter x 13m deep). The platform is transported and installed using a large flat top barge (BOA 35 measuring 124m long x 31.5m wide x 8m high) and 3 tug boats (75, 90 and 183 ton bollard pull) for the tow from BFG's yard in Vlissingen to the F3FA site in the Dutch sector of the North Sea. The leg lowering and deck lifting was achieved using 12x 900 ton strand jacks. The suction pile foundation was installed using 4x suction pumps. During the detailed design stage of the project, the concept design was subject to several elementary changes in the structural design. This had to do with the severe environment, the increased deck weight and water depth compared to the earlier utilisation of the concept. Fatigue and transport and installation issues had a significant impact on several key structural design elements. This complicated the deck-leg connections and several members in the truss deck. The deck leg connection was amended from a simple clamp connection in to a superbolt and sleeve connection at the top deck and a clamped and grouted connection at the cellar deck. In order to improve the stiffness of the legs, leg stiffening frames were placed on top of the suction piles. Due to the limited and slow roll & pitch response of the platform whilst on the BOA barge during tow, high seafastening forces were predicted. These high seafastening forces were transferred in to the barge using pinned seafastening arms. Water depth limitations and the additional leg stiffening frames necessitated to use a fairly high grillage structure of 6.5m high. All these items changed the deck construction towards a method obstructing completion of non-structural disciplines and changed the inshore mating operation of the substructure with that topside towards a complex lifting and fitting campaign. Despite these elementary design changes and some rigorous changes in the planning of the various activities, the contract schedule was achieved in time. The above efforts had an obvious effect on the managerial issues towards the project. It required a doubling of the manning levels and engineering issues of in some cases R&D nature. Despite all these challenges and complications, the platform left Vlissingen well ahead of time, on 18 August 2010, to set sail for the F3FA site. Upon arrival in the field, the weather deteriorated severely and the tow was forced to seek shelter in Rotterdam. Just before arrival in Rotterdam severe waves were encountered up to 6-7m maximum.Upon inspection in Rotterdam, the design proved to be resilient as no signs of damage were observed. Following 10 days waiting on weather the platform was towed to the field for the second time. Installation and lifting the deck to the top elevation was achieved within a record time of 2 days and 4 hours. Thereafter the platform hook-up team continued to work on the platform including completing the deck leg connections, such as installation of superbolts at the top deck level and clamp shells, rubber pads and grout at the cellar deck level. Further hook-up work consisted of hooking up the life support systems before arrival of the drill rig on 14th October 2010. The drilling of the first well was completed early January 2011 and first gas was introduced in to the pipeline system since week 4 of 2011.",,,,,"30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2011JUN 19-24, 2011","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Rotterdam, NETHERLANDSRotterdam, NETHERLANDS",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4433-5,,,,,,,,,"HFG, Zwijndrecht, NetherlandsIv Oil Gas 1v0G, Papendrecht, NetherlandsSPT Offshore SPT, Woerden, Netherlands",HFGIv Oil Gas 1v0GSPT Offshore SPT,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000314666100091,,

As a case area of the above carbonate reservoirs correlation, Tahe and Tazhong oilfields are chosen for the study through an integrated analysis of biostratigraphic isochronous framework, cores, thin sections, logs, and strontium isotopes. The research shows that the two areas were respectively attributed to different carbonate platforms during the Lianglitag Formation depositional phase. For the Lianglitag Formation, five fourth-order sequences may be divided in Tazhong, whereas only four fourth-order sequences are preserved in Tahe that correspond to the lower ones observed in Tazhong. The Lianglitag Formation carbonate platform in Tahe was characterized by ramp and/or weak rimmed types, with low depositional rates (37 mu m/a), higher whole-rock clastic contents, and higher Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios of carbonate matrix, showing relatively deep-water environment and evident terrigenous input for carbonate deposition. However, a strongly rimmed carbonate platform was developed in Tazhong, with high depositional rates of 250 mu m/a and less whole-rock clastic contents, indicating a high-energy depositional environment. Because of the sedimentary environment differences mentioned above, less high-energy facies but relatively intense syndepositional (early diagenetic) sea-water cementation of carbonates were developed in Tahe, and ubiquitous high-energy reef and shoal facies, with a frequent exposure to subaerial, and weak syndepositional sea-water cementation of carbonates in Tazhong. Therefore, fewer primary pores occurred in the Lianglitag Formation carbonate rocks of Tahe, whereas more primary pores were preserved in the same lithostratigraphic unit of the Tazhong (No. 1 fault zone). Available high-energy reef-shoal facies and early diagenesis, with more primary pores preserved, provided a key material basis for the Lianglitag Formation carbonate reservoirs that largely occurred in Tazhong.",,,,,,,,,21,9,0,0,2,1,25,,,1674-7313,1869-1897,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R ChinaState Intellectual Property Off China, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China",State Intellectual Property Off China,,,2012-10-31,WOS:000309468700007,,

The system can figure out the extent of CO2 injected area and assure that CO2 is not escaped above seal rocks. The use of the system is advantageous from the long term view of the cost. In this paper, we, firstly, present a simulation study based on the data from the Nagaoka CCS test site. 4D response was evaluated using crossplot of NRMS and PRED indices so that we could estimate the discrimination degree between 4D responses caused by CO2 injection and other 4D noises. Basic test experiments of a permanent OBC system have been conducted in Sites A and B in Japan and repeated seismic surveys using airgun source were shot for evaluating the 4D noise response. Tidal correction is found not to be simple as the wavelet shape itself is modified in the shallow water condition. P-SV reflections are recorded with three-component geophones installed in the OBC which will contribute to the CCS reservoir characterization and monitoring. A microseismic event with the magnitude of 0.6 occurred at the depth of 103 kilometers just below Site A was detected. As the CO2 geological sequestration will be conducted within several thousand meters, detectable limit is estimated down to magnitude minus two in an ideal condition. (C) 2013 The Authors.

In this paper, the life performance of an offshore platform is analysed by comparing three representative stages of an oil field (early-life, plateau and end-life productions). The energy requirements are assessed by a process integration study, and the system inefficiencies are pinpointed by performing an exergy accounting. The heating and cooling requirements vary significantly over time, and most inefficiencies take place in processes where chemical exergy is consumed (similar or equal to 50-55%), thermal exergy is transferred (similar or equal to 15-20%), or mechanical exergy is varied (similar or equal to 0-15%). These findings are valid for all production periods: this suggests that more attention should be paid on a proper integration of the processing and utility plants, by, for instance, recovering heat from the turbine exhausts and from the exported gas. Multi-objective optimisations are conducted for evaluating the integration of steam and organic Rankine cycles, considering thermodynamic, economic and environmental performance indicators. They indicate that the profitability of a given improvement measure mainly depends on (i) the field properties, (ii) the platform operating strategy, and (iii) the production stage of the oil field. The implementation of steam networks appears promising, as it results in a better performance of the offshore platform and in larger economic profits. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A new sedimentary facies, namely the beach bar sand body, was identified in the Yanchang Formation. In the outcrop, the geometric shape with a flat base and a convex top is seen. Linear conformity is found between the base of the sand body and the underlying lacustrine shale, and markers of exposure are observed at the top. Various sedimentary structures attributed to wave action are developed within the sand body, with lack of erosion and filling structures. The single sand body presents inverse grading from bottom to top, while the compositional maturity of the beach bar sand formed in one stage gradually increases upwards and reaches its maximum at the top of the bar. The grain size probability curve is mainly triple-segmented with double saltation load and single suspended load. In terms of seismic reflection, the beach bar sand shows growing events, discontinuous amplitudes, and an external form of seismic unit with a flat base and convex top.

The data obtained from WSN-based safety sensors show that the proposed system can continuously monitor and evaluate the structural stability of the pipe rack, and provide risk management guidelines based on real-world measurements.",,,,,47th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences47th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,"JAN 06-09, 2014JAN 06-09, 2014","Univ Hawaii, Shidler Coll Business; IEEE Comp SocUniv Hawaii, Shidler Coll Business; IEEE Comp Soc","Waikoloa, HIWaikoloa, HI",5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,1060-3425,,978-1-4799-2504-9,,,,,,,,,"Korea Elect Technol Instutute, IoT Convergence Res Ctr, Songnam, South Korea",Korea Elect Technol Instutute,,,2014-12-03,WOS:000343806605035,,

The data demonstrate the existence of a shallow well-ventilated northern-sourced cell overlying a poorly ventilated, predominantly southern-sourced cell at the Last Glacial Maximum. We also find that organic carbon remineralization rates in the deep Atlantic remained broadly similar to modern, but that ventilation ages in the southern-sourced overturning cell were significantly increased. Respired carbon storage in the deep Atlantic was therefore enhanced during the last glacial period, primarily due to an increase in the residence time of carbon in the deep ocean, rather than an increase in biological carbon export.",,,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,5,0,38,,,2041-1723,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Godwin Lab Palaeoclimate Res, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, EnglandLab CNRS CEA UVSQ, LSCE IPSL, Domaine CNRS, Bat 12, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France",,,,2016-06-01,WOS:000379109400001,27346723,

However, it is unclear how this flavobacterial population adapts to hadal conditions. In this study, extensive comparative genomic analyses were performed for the flavobacterial strain Euzebyella marina RN62 isolated from the Mariana Trench hadal water in low abundance. The complete genome of RN62 possessed a considerable number of carbohydrate-active enzymes with a different composition. There was a predominance of GH family 13 proteins compared to closely related relatives, suggesting that RN62 has preserved a certain capacity for carbohydrate utilization and that the hadal ocean may hold an organic matter reservoir distinct from the surface ocean. Additionally, RN62 possessed potential intracellular cycling of the glycogen/starch pathway, which may serve as a strategy for carbon storage and consumption in response to nutrient pulse and starvation. Moreover, the discovery of higher glycoside hydrolase dissimilarities among Flavobacteriia, compared to peptidases and transporters, suggested variation in polysaccharide utilization related traits as an important ecophysiological factor in response to environmental alterations, such as decreased labile organic carbon in hadal waters. The presence of abundant toxin exporting, transcription and signal transduction related genes in RN62 may further help to survive in hadal conditions, including high pressure/low temperature.

Our definition of enterprise models is based on a philosophy for thinking about enterprise in terms of ''an Organization, carrying out a set of Processes to create one or more Products which satisfy predefined Objectives.'' This framework, which we have denoted the OPPO, illustrates our belief that enterprise models must give a complete and correct description of relevant aspects of reality in order to address their stated purpose. Based on the OPPO framework and an information processing view of project enterprise, we formalize our models using a methodology:or describing coordination requirements. This is based on a set of interaction matrices to develop so-called ''houses of complexity, uncertainty and interdependence'' that describe important dependencies between project requirements (objectives), deliverables (products), activities (process), and team members (organization). We use these dependencies as a basis for deriving measures of the coordination which must take place between various project participants during project execution. We can then use these coordination requirements as input to analysis, in the Virtual Design Team (VDT) object oriented discrete event simulation environment. The simulation results can be used for systematically assessing predicted effects of proposed changes. The framework, methodology, and analysis is illustrated by an example from engineering design of subsea modules for oil and gas production in offshore field development. The results from simulation give various performance measures, including critical path duration, work volume (a substitute for cost), and process performance in coordination (error handling and communication attendance).",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,1063-293X,,,,,,,,,,,"DNV RES,N-1322 HOVIK,NORWAYSTANFORD UNIV,DEPT CIVIL ENGN,STANFORD,CA 94305",DNV RES,,,1996-09-01,WOS:A1996VM96200005,,

Here synthetic gas hydrate (SGH) is quickly formed for the first time by fluids and bubbles erupted from the active cold seeps at the Formosa Ridge in the South China Sea (SCS). SGH samples are in situ detected by a Raman insertion probe for gas hydrate (RiP-Gh) which is deployed by the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Faxian. Both spatial and temporal in situ Raman spectra of the SGH samples are acquired in order to determine the structure and the evolution of the synthetic gas hydrate. Authigenic carbonate debris or other debris serving as nucleation particles, which is found in the in situ Raman spectra of SGH samples for the first time, may be one factor that can promote the formation of synthetic gas hydrate. The gas-water interface demonstrated by the observation results, also contributes to the quick formation of SGH samples, which agrees well with the previous study. In situ Raman spectra of three SGH samples which have been placed on the seafloor for 0 h, 4 h and 21 h respectively are acquired. Laboratory Raman spectra of one sample which has been surprisingly found and recovered after 9840 h (410 days) since formed on the seafloor are also acquired. The Raman spectra of the four SGH samples indicate that the methane large-to-small cage occupancy ratios of the hydrates vary from 1.01 to 1.39, and the ratios of methane large-to-gas of the hydrates increase from 0.53 to 1.55.

Saltwater intrusion and drought represent serious threats to the stability of coastal wetlands, and may therefore cause substantial changes in their ability to store carbon. Coastal wetlands, including the Florida Everglades, persist under relatively low rates of sea level rise by accumulating soil carbon fast enough for wetland elevation to keep pace. In the Florida coastal Everglades, faster sea level rise, combined with increases in drought and freshwater diversion, have resulted in saltwater moving into coastal freshwater wetlands, changing processes that affect the rates of carbon storage, potentially altering the pace of wetland elevation increases. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant will provide funds to experimentally simulate saltwater intrusion and drought in a brackish Everglades marsh to determine how changes in productivity, soil carbon pools, and water chemistry affect losses in soil elevation and nutrient export to estuaries. Results from this research will provide information for conservation and restoration efforts not only in the Everglades but also for coastal wetlands globally. The project will also give research and lab experience to undergraduates at a major Hispanic-serving institution. Researchers will use this project to inform and engage the public on coastal environmental issues through a variety of outreach activities. In coastal wetlands, the rates of primary production often exceed decomposition, and can result in significant storage of soil carbon. Preliminary results have suggested a strong interaction between saltwater intrusion and drought on the rates of soil carbon storage in coastal wetlands, but questions remain about the magnitude and mechanisms behind these responses. This research uses a controlled experimental manipulation in which coastal wetland mesocosms are subjected to elevated salinity and simulated drought to disentangle the interactive effects of these two drivers. Changes in carbon storage will be measured through carbon dioxide gas exchange and organic carbon stocks (above and below ground), inputs (root productivity, sediment surface accretion), and outputs (organic carbon decomposition). This research will: (1) Identify changes in carbon and biogeochemical cycling in brackish water coastal peat marshes experiencing elevated salinity and prolonged drought; (2) Test the resilience of coastal marshes to drought through evaluation of a post-drought recovery phase; and (3) Assess the potential for elevated salinity and drought to cause the loss of peat elevation and conversion to open water wetlands.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1701763,,,,,,,,Florida International University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13852960,,

Our results show the dispersant was not toxic to the indigenous microbes at concentrations added, and different bacterial species isolated in the aftermath of the spill were able to degrade the various components of Corexit 9500 that included hydrocarbons, glycols, and dioctyl sulfosuccinate.",,,,,,,,,75,0,0,0,67,0,87,,,,1664-302X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Earth Sci, Dept Ecol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAUniv Tennessee, Dept Microbiol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",,,,2012-01-01,WOS:000208863600359,23087678,

Like their sister taxa, the well-documented Common Loon (G. immer) of the boreal forest, Yellow-billed Loons exhibit strong territorial behavior during the breeding season. Little is known about what size territories are required, however, or how readily territories are retained from year to year. An understanding of territory dynamics and size is needed by management agencies as most of the U.S. breeding population of Yellow-billed Loons resides in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska where oil and gas development is expected to increase in the next few decades. Using locational data from a set of Yellow-billed Loons marked with satellite transmitters, we quantified an index of territory radius for each of three breeding populations: two in Alaska and one in Canada. The mean territory radius was 0.42 km for Yellow-billed Loons summering on lakes within the Seward Peninsula in northwest Alaska, 0.69 km for Yellow-billed Loons within the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska (encompasses the National Petroleum Reserve), and 0.96 km for Yellow-billed Loons within Daring Lake in mainland Canada. In this study, the mean territory radius on the Arctic Coastal Plain was about half the distance identified in stipulations for industrial development in the National Petroleum Reserve. The range in territory size among areas corresponded to a gradient in size of lakes used by Yellow-billed Loons with territories at the two Alaska sites on lakes averaging < 200 ha while territories in Canada were generally on much larger lakes. In the year after capture, 71% of Yellow-billed Loons retained territories that were held the previous year. Most Yellow-billed Loons that lost their territories wandered over a large area within 6 km of their prior territory. No Yellow-billed Loons occupied new territories, though one reacquired its prior territory after a 1-year hiatus. Retention of a territory in a subsequent year was positively related to early arrival dates at the breeding site. For Yellow-billed Loons on the Arctic Coastal Plain, this relationship was quite strong with a week lag in arrival decreasing the probability of retaining a territory by 80%. These collective observations, in combination with theoretical studies of population regulation by floaters (non-territorial birds), suggest that lake habitat suitable for breeding Yellow-billed Loons may currently limit population size in this species.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,12,0,14,,,1524-4695,1938-5390,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USABiodivers Res Inst, Gorham, ME 04038 USAFairwinds Wildlife Serv, Palmer, AK 99645 USA",Biodivers Res InstFairwinds Wildlife Serv,,,2014-06-18,WOS:000335613500008,,

It is estimated that over 50 of the 475 structures that eventually will have to be decommissioned will be decommissioned by 2018. While most structures will be removed entirely, some larger platforms and pipelines currently cannot be removed without causing serious environmental harm. The structures that remain in place are cleaned and made safe and then they are regularly monitored by the oil and gas company that owns them to ensure that they are not causing any adverse impacts on the environment. Currently this monitoring is done using a survey ship, which at tens of thousands of pounds a day, becomes very expensive. This is not conducive to regular monitoring, which in turn increases the risks of any impacts going undetected. This project aims to introduce a new approach for monitoring of decommissioned structures - autonomous submarines. These vehicles are becoming more widely adopted by industry. It has been demonstrated that these vehicles can be launched from shore and carry out complex missions underwater, collecting information on the seabed type and biological environment, while also monitoring pollution. However, so far they have not yet been applied to decommissioning and existing sensors and protocols need to be reconfigured to collect the data that is required for environmental monitoring around decommissioned structures. Working with our project partners, Shell, BP, BEIS, Gardline and SeeByte, this project will address these challenges and develop approaches for collection of appropriate monitoring data to regularly assess the impact of decommissioned structures with autonomous vehicle. The approaches will be integrated within the standard practices of oil companies to ensure that they are realistic and widely adopted for monitoring. The integration of this new information with existing baseline information on the areas will also be considered. This will ultimately reduce the costs associated with monitoring and improve the quality and quantity of data that can be obtained, which will reduce the risk of environmental damage from decommissioned structures.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/P016561/1,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15298446,,

The scenario includes a successful helicopter rescue of the 16 crewmembers and a partial recovery of oil and chemicals by booms and skimmers. Recovery of chemicals with physical properties not allowing mechanical collection is not attempted. The scenario ends as the abandoned wreck is broken down at the stranding location, and containers rupture and discharge their cargo.

On August 14, 2017, the Rehoboth Beach Commissioners unanimously approved awarding four bid packages to various contractors to begin construction on the ocean outfall project. The four bid packages were treatment plant improvements, effluent pump station, on-shore pipeline, and offshore pipeline including a diffuser to comply with the consent decree.

Tidal bores and associated rapid flood flows are highly turbulent flows of the upper-flow regime with a velocity over several meters per second. Reynolds (R (e)) and Froude (F (r)) numbers, respectively, are larger than 10(4) and 1.0, making them significantly different from regular tidal flows but analogous to turbidity currents. Until now, understanding of tidal-bore depositional processes and products has been limited because of the difficulty and hazards involved with gauging tidal bores directly. The Qiantang bore is known as the largest breaking bore in the world. Field surveys were carried out in May 2010, along the north bank of the Qiantang Estuary to observe the occurrence of peak bores, including regular observations of current, water level and turbidity at the main channel. Several short cores were sampled on the intertidal flats to study the characteristic sedimentary features of tidal bores. Hydrodynamic and sedimentological studies show that the processes of sediment resuspension, transport and deposition are controlled primarily by the tidal bores, and the subsequent abruptly accelerated and decelerated flood flows, which only account for one tenth of each semidiurnal tidal cycle in the estuary. Tidal-bore deposits are generally poorly sorted because of rapid sedimentation after highly mixed suspension by intense turbulence. This behavior is characteristic of the absence of tractive-current depositional components in a C-M diagram. It also goes along with well-developed massive bedding, graded bedding, basal erosion structures, convolute bedding and dewatering structures. Together, these sedimentary features can constitute fingerprinting of turbidites, widely distributed in the deep-water environment. However, a tidal bore is triggered by intensely deformed tidal waves propagating into a shallow-water environment, which returns to regular tidal flows rapidly after the passage of the bore head. The tidal-bore deposits are usually bounded by the intertidal-flat deposits with typical tidal beddings at the top and on both flanks. The difference between tidal-bore deposits (TBD) and tidal sandy/muddy deposits (TSD/TMD) is evident not only in sedimentary structures, but also in the grain-size composition. They can be clearly distinguished in grain-size bivariate plots, typically the plot of mean grain size vs. standard deviation (or sorting). Some trend variations generally exist in mean grain size with TBD > TSD > TMD, sorting with TMD > TBD > TSD (larger value indicating poorer sorting), and both skewness and kurtosis with TSD > TBD > TMD. These findings will undoubtedly shed new light on our understanding of tidal-bore sedimentology, ancient tidal-bore sedimentary facies and environments, and related oil-and-gas field prospecting.",,,,,,,,,25,7,0,0,4,0,31,,,1001-6538,1861-9541,,,,,,,,,,"Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Marine Geol, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R ChinaState Ocean Adm, Key Lab Marine Sedimentol & Environm Geol, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R ChinaE China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China",State Ocean Adm,,,2012-05-16,WOS:000303388200015,,

The utilisation of the ocean includes common interests for food provision, artisanal fishing opportunity, natural products, carbon storage, coastal protection, tourism and recreation, coastal livelihoods and economies, sense of place, clean waters and biodiversity. An index is required to relate the marine renewable energy industry to ocean healthiness quantitatively. The Ocean Health Index (OHI) recently published in Nature measures the healthiness of the ocean within 171 Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). This study identified several data gaps and suggests improvements for the treatment of MRE in OHI calculations. It is suggested to include MRE effects under pressure (p(1)) or resilience (r(1)) variables based on the MRE technology type, stage of operation and its effects on OHI goals. The study suggests the OHI may be a suitable indicator to monitor MRE developments after fully including the components of MRE.

To combat these losses, and reestablish ecosystem function, goods, and services, many restoration projects have been constructed or planned throughout coastal Louisiana. There are significant data gaps and conflicting results regarding wetland contributions to global warming, especially related to carbon sequestration in restored wetlands. An exceptionally large data set was used to derive carbon accumulation rates from key soil characteristics and processes. Assessments and comparisons of bulk density, organic matter, total carbon, vertical accretion (short- and longer-term), and carbon accumulation rates were made across time (chronosequence) and space (i.e., coastwide, watershed basins, and vegetation zones). Carbon accumulation rates in the Louisiana coastal zone were generally correlated to hydrogeomorphology, with higher rates occurring in zones of high river connectivity or in swamp or higher salinity tolerant marsh. On average, naturally occurring wetlands had higher carbon accumulation rates than restoration sites. Although some restoration measures were higher, and most showed increasing carbon accumulation rates over time. Results demonstrate that although wetland restoration provides many ecosystem benefits, the associated carbon sequestration may also provide useful measures for climate change management.

Especially, explosions lead to serious damages to human, safety, and environment. To minimise and prevent the damage from explosions, blast walls are generally installed in oil and gas production structures. Typical blast walls are classified into flat, corrugated, and stiffened types. Among them, corrugated blast walls are frequently used for reasons such as construction, cost, and energy absorption. However, it has been known that a corrugated type of blast wall buckles between the web and flange under the explosion loads, and loses its stiffness. It means that the buckling phenomenon of a blast wall is closely related to the structural strength. This study investigates on the structural characteristics of a blast wall under quasi-static and dynamic (explosion) loads with or without a flat-plated stiffener. Finally, it can be concluded that the flat type of stiffeners are located at the buckling region to delay the buckling and improve the strength of blast walls.",,,,,,,,,13,2,0,0,0,0,14,,,1744-5302,1754-212X,,,,,,,,,,"Korea Res Inst Ships & Ocean Engn, Offshore Plant Res Div, Daejeon, South KoreaPusan Natl Univ, Korea Ship & Offshore Res Inst, Lloyds Register Fdn Res Ctr Excellence, Busan, South KoreaUCL, Dept Mech Engn, London, England",,,,2016-09-11,WOS:000380199900008,,

In adult stage they lack mouth and gut and rely their nutrition on chemoautotrophic bacterial symbionts inhabiting cells of the trophosome, a peculiar organ of symbiotrophic nutrition. Classical studies on the structure and development of Pogonophora were led by the Russian zoologist academician A.V. Ivanov. Unfortunately, these studies were based on the idea of deuterostomic affinity of pogonophorans what had strong impact on results. Thus, the divisions of the coelomic system were shown as in typical deuterostomic animals, and in the development the enterocoely was desribed as well as anteroposterior growth of mesoderm as in the group of Deuterostomia. This data contradicts the current interpretation of Pogonophora as representatives of phylum Annelida and needs revision by modern methods, including electron microscopy, laser confocal microscopy and 3D modeling. The first representatives of vestimentiferan tubeworms were described in the late 1960s, later a great variety of vestimentiferans was found in areas of hydrothermal vents and cold hydrocarbon seeps. The microscopic anatomy of the vestimentiferans is less studied than their physiology, biochemistry, and physiology of their prokaryotic symbionts. Until now, for example, there is no reconstruction of the vestimentiferan nervous system at a state-of-the-art level, and it is unclear what is the nature of the vestimentiferan excretory system, what is necessary for comparison with annelids. The tasks of the work include the study of the morphological organization and development of pogonophorans and vestimentiferans by modern methods, including methods of 3D reconstructions, electron microscopy and laser confocal microscopy in order to give a complete state-of-the-art reconstruction of the structure and development of these animals. Findings of pogonophorans and cold seeps' vestimentifierans are shown from areas of hydrocarbon seepages. Shallow-water pogonophorans have been found in sediments with high concentration of methane. It is assumed that pogonophorans (mainly deep-sea group) could serve as indicators of deep-sea hydrocarbon deposits. However, so far there is no map at a global scale where habitats of pogonophorans and cold seeps' vestimentifierans are compiled with the areas of hydrocarbon deposits. Modern GIS-methods will make it possible to generate the maps and to assess the importance of tubeworms' groups Pogonophora and Vestimentifera as indicators of underwater (including deep-sea) oil and gas fields.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,18-14-00141,,,,,,,,Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education Lomonosov Moscow State University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15285387,,

This work studied the effect of level and duration of mixing energy on USA formation using the standard reference material 1941b and Arabian light crude oil. The results showed that dispersed small oil droplets increased with an increase of both the level and duration of mixing energy to form multi-droplet OSAs. The sizes of the dispersed droplets varied between 5 and 10 pm under different conditions studied. The maximum oil trapping efficiency increased from 23% to 33%, the oil to sediment ratio increased from 030 to 0.43 g oil/g sediment, and the required shaking time decreased from 2.3 to 1.1 has the shaking rate increased from 2.0 to 2.3 Hz.

To fix the safe pipeline parameters such as outer diameter, inner diameter, submerged weight and the anchorage length, pipeline software is required for online routing analysis. In this pipeline routing software, resultant bending stresses are found due to loading on the vertical plane, and the horizontal plane is considered. The current forces acting on the pipeline are assumed as horizontal loading, which is resisted by the lateral frictional resistance. In the analysis, the seabed is having various slopes, seabed depressions (or pockmarks) and the elevated rocky outcrops is considered. These parameters change with respect to site and environmental conditions. Also, in the routing, a number of routes have to be analyzed to find the optimum route with respect to the input pipeline parameters and environmental site conditions.

Frequent oil-spill accidents not only cause severe and long-term damages to marine ecosystems, but also lead to a great loss of valuable resources. To eliminate the environmental pollution of oil spills, an efficient and environment-friendly oil-recovery approach is necessary. In this study,(1)expanded graphite (EG) modified by CTAB-KBr/H3PO4 was synthesized via composite intercalation agents of CTAB-KBr and natural flake graphite, followed by the activation of phosphoric acid at low temperature. The resultant modified expanded graphite (M-EG) obtained an interconnected and continuous open microstructure with lower polarity surface, more and larger pores, and increased surface hydrophobicity. Due to these characteristics, M-EG exhibited a superior adsorption capacity towards marine oil. The saturated adsorption capacities of M-EG were as large as 7.44 g/g for engine oil, 6.12 g/g for crude oil, 5.34 g/g for diesel oil and 4.10 g/g for gasoline oil in 120min, exceeding the capacity of pristine EG. Furthermore, M-EG maintained good removal efficiency under different adsorption conditions, such as temperature, oil types, and sodium salt concentration. In addition, oils sorbed into M-EG could be recovered either by a simple compression or filtration-drying treatment with a recovery ratio of 58-83%. However, filtration-drying treatment shows better performance in preserving microstructures of M-EG, which ensures the adsorbents can be recycled several times. High removal capability, fast adsorption efficiency, excellent stability and good recycling performance make M-EG an ideal candidate for treating marine oil pollution in practical application.

Capitalising on this potential, however, remains largely unrealised due in part to an incomplete understanding of the full greenhouse gas mitigation benefits provided, particularly through changes in landuse where aquaculture ponds are converted back to mangroves. Here we address such uncertainties by estimating the overall net greenhouse offset potential from rehabilitating mangroves in Tiwoho, North Sulawesi (Indonesia). Estimates of both baseline emissions and sequestration as mangrove forests regrow after rehabilitation were assessed, with results contrasted against published data on established mangroves and terrestrial forest carbon projects registered with the Verified Carbon Standard. Additionally, net emissions removals and reductions from Tiwoho is scaled-up to the national level in order to estimate the contribution rehabilitation of disused ponds can make to climate change mitigation. We also monetarise potential returns generated to date and frame this against project implementation and opportunity costs. Our data indicates that, on average, Tiwoho's rehabilitating sites could potentially mitigate upwards of -27.6 +/- 1.7 Mg CO2-e per hectare per year. This is upwards of 3 times that of other terrestrial forestry carbon projects and, assuming a voluntary carbon market price of USD $8.1 per Mg CO2-e per hectare for afforestation/reforestation projects, equates to recuperation of 76.2% of initial project implementation costs over approximately 10 years with an annual return of 7.6%. This return rate rivals that of most asset classes targeted by private sector investors. Scaling results to encompass the net emissions removals and reduction potential from rehabilitating the similar to 600, 000 hectares of disused ponds in Indonesia may offset upwards of -16.56 +/- 1.02 million Mg CO2-e per hectare per year. Additionally, mitigation benefits from rehabilitation may equate to 6 times that of terrestrial projects if situated in ponds displaying both high baseline emissions and high rates of re-growth whilst accounting for sequestration from benthic algae and the oceanic burial of dissolved inorganic carbon.

Arctic offshore region is reported to hold a great proportion of un-discovered oil reserves. While this can be a promising opportunity for the industry, more exploration activities will also increase the possibility of oil spill during the entire process including production and transport. A comprehensive risk assessment based on Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) method is then required during the planning and operation stages of future Arctic oil production facilities. In the exposure analysis stage, ERA needs an evaluation of the oil concentration profile in all media. This paper presents a methodology for predicting the stochastic fate and transport of spilled oil in ice-infested regions. For this purpose, level IV fugacity models are used to estimate the time-variable concentration of oil. A hierarchical Bayesian approach (HBA) is adopted to estimate the probability of time to reach a concentration (TRTC) based on the observations made from a fugacity model. To illustrate the application of the proposed method, a subsea pipeline accident resulting in the release of 100 t of Statfjord oil into the Labrador Sea is considered as the case study.

Such events have important implications for medicine and can provide crucial lessons for the future. However, white the medical aspects of war have received considerable attention, rather less is known about civilian disasters. To redress this imbalance, this article reviews three major British disasters of the 1980s where serious burns injury was a significant feature of the human casualty: the Bradford City Football Club fire of 1985, the King's Cross Underground fire of 1987 and the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster of 1988. Four related themes are used to examine in detail the ways in which these events impacted on medicine: plastics and reconstructive surgery, clinical psychology, disaster management and tong-term structural change. Drawing on articles in specialist burns and psychiatric journals, together with the personal communications and recollections of surgeons and psychiatrists involved, it is revealed that while ground-breaking advances are a relative rarity in medicine, numerous small but significant lessons did emerge from these events, although often in subtle and highly specialised fields of medicine.

Here, we report -unprecedented multidecadal shifts in forest carbon uptake in semi-arid Mediterranean pine forests in Spain over 1950-2012. The averaged carbon sink reduction varies between 31% and 37%, and reaches values in the range of 50% in the most affected forest stands. Regime shifts in forest carbon uptake are associated with climatic early warning signals, decreased forest regional synchrony and reduced long-term carbon sink resilience. We identify the mechanisms linked to ocean multidecadal variability that shape regime shifts in carbon capture. First, we show that low-frequency variations of the surface temperature of the Atlantic Ocean induce shifts in the nonstationary effects of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on regional forest carbon capture. Modelling evidence supports that the non-stationary effects of ENSO can be propagated from tropical areas to semi-arid Mediterranean biomes through atmospheric wave trains. Second, decadal changes in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) significantly alter sea-air heat exchanges, modifying in turn ocean vapour transport over land and land surface temperatures, and promoting sustained drought conditions in spring and summer that reduce forest carbon uptake. Third, we show that lagged effects of AMO on the winter North Atlantic Oscillation also contribute to the maintenance of long-term droughts. Finally, we show that the reported strong, negative effects of ocean surface temperature (AMO) on forest carbon uptake in the last decades are unprecedented over the last 150 years. Our results provide new, unreported explanations for carbon uptake shifts in these drought-prone forests and review the expected impacts of global warming on the profiled mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,22,1,0,0,12,1,23,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Barcelona, Dept Evolutionary Biol Ecol & Environm Sci, BEECA, E-08028 Barcelona, SpainCREAF, Barcelona, SpainGroningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, GELIFES, Groningen, NetherlandsUniv Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Geog, Grumets Res Grp, Bellaterra, SpainUniv Autonoma Barcelona, Grumets Res Grp, Dept Anim Biol Plant Biol & Ecol, Bellaterra, SpainCSIC, IPE, Zaragoza, SpainUniv Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, LSCE, IPSL,CEA,CNRS,UVSQ, Gif Sur Yvette, FranceLudwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Geog, Munich, GermanyUniv Complutense Madrid, UCM, Madrid, SpainUniv Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Earth Syst Sci Grp, Exeter, Devon, EnglandUniv Montpellier, Inst Sci Evolut, CNRS, UMR 5554, Montpellier, FranceUAB, CSIC, CREAF, Global Ecol Unit, Barcelona, Spain",Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci,,,2019-11-28,WOS:000497502700025,31012512,

The bivalve Mya truncata is common in Svalbard fjord (Norway) where it experiences low temperature throughout the year. To measure the impact of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) on M. truncata, the responses of three biomarkers [total oxyradical scavenging capacity-assay (TOSC), plasma membrane stability of haemocytes and respiration rates] were investigated from bivalves exposed to sediment contaminated with a PAH mixture (crude oil). After two weeks of exposure to the contaminated sediment, TOSC showed no change. The high TOSC value (4010 +/- 1339 unit mg (-1) protein) of Mya truncata (control group) is thought to protect biomolecules with a low turnover rate efficiently in a low food availability environment. In the exposed bivalves, the haemocyte cellular membranes were significantly destabilised compared with controls (P < 0.05). Respiration rate of control and PAH-exposed individuals (0.055 +/- 0.020 mg O-2 dw(-1) h(-1)) was similar and relatively low as is typical for polar bivalves, reflecting a strategy to minimise energy expenditure to cope with 9 months of starvation. Bioaccumulation of PAH by M. truncata was also low, due probably to a combination of low metabolic rate and reduced solubility of the oil compounds at low temperature. Data indicated an uptake of mainly low molecular weight compounds (two and three ring molecules). A good correlation of logBAF(lipid) (bioaccumulation factor) and logK(ow) (octanol/water partitioning coefficient) was shown (r(2) = 0.87). Tissue sensitivity and/or functional differences (digestive gland vs. haemocytes), PAH uptake route (dietary vs. gills), the low metabolic rate of M. truncata and the low environmental temperature (reducing the bioavailability of PAH) are factors that help explain these findings.

While much research has tested impacts of P. australis removal on plant and faunal communities, less is known about biogeochemical responses to P. australis removal. Since coastal marshes are valued for their robust carbon sequestration, understanding the effect of P. australis removal on marsh carbon cycling dynamics is important. Temporary P. australis aboveground biomass clearing conducted as part of a restoration effort provided an opportunity to evaluate changes in fluxes of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) during P. australis removal and recovery. In Experiment 1 (2014 growing season), GHG fluxes were compared between a P. australis stand cleared mechanically and recovered within months of initial removal and an uncleared stand in the same marsh system. CO2 uptake increased dramatically in the cleared stand as P. australis regrew, but CH4 emissions remained unchanged, demonstrating that P. australis did not directly contribute to CH4 emission. In Experiment 2 (2015 manipulations), to test mechanisms of P. australis' impact on GHG fluxes, fluxes (light and dark) were compared between unimpacted P. australis plots, cut P. australis plots with litter, and cleared P. australis plots without litter. P. australis cutting (independent of litter removal) resulted in increased CO2 and CH4 emissions. Recovery of P. australis directly drove the rapid recovery of CO2 uptake, and did not increase (and possibly attenuated) CH4 emissions. Results of this study suggest that at this site, P. australis removal, in the absence of native vegetation recovery, may exacerbate GHG emission of coastal marshes in the short term, and that longer-term impacts warrant investigation.

Instead of pressurization by the addition of gas, water was injected into the sediment to create the high pressure environment of the reservoir, thereby creating a hydrate bearing sediment of high water saturation similar to those in marine locations. A framework is introduced to determine fractions of methane converted into hydrates during hydrate formation stage taking into account the effect of density changes, solubility and the in-situ pressure and temperature conditions. As opposed to 100% conversion assumed in the previous excess water works, our quantification shows that on average, the fractional conversion of methane is around 81.5% at comparable or larger experimental time scales (76-408 h). Upon the formation of quantitatively similar hydrate bearing sediments, the dissociation of methane hydrate was done under a constant pressure of 4.5 MPa subjecting to different thermal stimulation extents from 278.7 K to 285.2 K. It was found that low temperature driving force would result in an extremely low dissociation rate, and a minimum temperature of 280.7 K (corresponding to 2.1 K temperature driving force) is required to achieve a 90% dissociation within 10 h. In addition, through a simplified estimation of energy efficiency ratio (EER) and analysis of water production profile, we demonstrated the importance of water management in developing methods to effectively recover energy from hydrate bearing sediments.

This is also the case.Overall, the excavation of Mado Shipwreck provided meaningful data that contributed greatly to the understanding of the transportation history, tax system, and land system during the Goryeo Dynasty. Nevertheless, it is also true that many questions and limitations are revealed. In particular, the loss of wooden tabletsÂ·bamboo Slips makes it difficult to understand overall, and the limitations of deciphering also make it difficult to grasp the data. These problems are expected to be resolved little by little through continuous excavation and systematic deciphering.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1225-8970,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-06-22,KJD:ART002654147,,

These carbon stores range from dead leaves and wood to the fossil carbon in coal, oil and gas. They contain large amounts of usable chemical energy. When the ancestors of modem humans learned to access this energy by mastering fire, they discovered a 'new trick' which led to massive evolutionary advantages for the human species. In the technological explosion of the last two centuries, industrial-scale use of energy flows from fossil carbon has not only transformed human societies and ecosystems, but also caused exponentially increasing accumulation of the released carbon in atmospheric, land and ocean carbon reservoirs. These changes have altered the carbon cycle and other cycles of matter and energy in the earth system, leading to the term 'Anthropocene' for the current epoch. In this epoch humankind is encountering finite-planet vulnerabilities for the first time, as a consequence of the dominance of its home planet bequeathed by the use of energy flows from detrital carbon. Signs of these vulnerabilities can be seen in the contemporary carbon cycle and emerging carbon-climate feedbacks.

Thus, their mobility is inevitably restricted for immediate operation. Therefore, it is expected that the demand for the development of compact and intelligent Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to undertake these complicated missions will increase greatly over the next few years.Since AUV navigation into a semi-closed space is a dangerous operation, the AUV should be aware of its surroundings in real time and make careful path planning based on sensory data. Although acoustic sensors are utilized to survey underwater objects, they are seriously affected by multipath effects in a narrow closed space, and may have poor accuracy and resolution, which are not sufficient for AUV navigation.In this paper, we propose an autonomous navigation and investigation system by stereo vision for surveying closed spaces.

They rely heavily on local ecosystems for their livelihoods and security; for example mangrove forests provide them with firewood, fish, medicines and protection from floods and coastal erosion. Despite the importance of mangroves they are suffering high rates of destruction. This project will pioneer new ways of studying, evaluating and managing mangroves, and will communicate the lessons learnt to groups working in other types of ecosystems. Mangrove forests are highly productive and efficient at capturing carbon, much of which ends up buried below ground and can therefore be permanently stored away from the atmosphere. This opens up possibilities for using payments for carbon credits to help mangrove conservation and to bring revenue for local people. This project will initiate a real demonstration of how to achieve this, combining the expertise of Kenyan and UK scientists, accreditation by a third party charity and the commitment and organisation of the Gazi Womens' Mangrove Boardwalk Committee. A Kenyan sociology student will make a detailed study of the development of this project to record the lessons learnt. She will particularly focus on how different groups, such as men and women and old and young, become engaged and benefit, on how the management of the mangrove resource works and on how this project can inform others in the region that use payments for ecosystem services. The value of mangrove ecosystems to local people, and particularly to the poor, is often underestimated by developers and politicians. Full estimations of economic value for individual sites can be difficult and expensive - one option is to transfer the results from well studied areas to other sites, but this approach is untested for mangroves and may lead to large errors. We will test this 'benefit transfer' approach by measuring a range of direct use values (including for fuelwood, timber, crabs and shrimp) at seven different sites in Kenya. By looking for correlations between these results and variables that can help predict them, such as levels of poverty and population density, and by comparing what local people say about the value of their mangrove resources, we will determine the reliability of benefit transfer between sites, which will allow us to calculate the economic value of the mangrove resource in Kenya. Since carbon storage is a key benefit of mangroves it is important for developing countries to know the extent of their forests and the biomass of carbon in them, but measuring this on the ground is expensive and difficult. We will use remote sensing techniques to develop 'carbon landscapes' for East Africa that identify the biomass of carbon (including that stored below-ground) in different areas. We will combine these maps with 'risk maps' and 'value maps' that show areas under high threat and with high value, and present these on a user-friendly platform that can be accessed by government and NGOs when developing projects and policy. It is essential that developing countries have the capacity to identify threats to their people's livelihoods and to respond to international opportunities for conservation financing, such as those coming from climate change negotiations. Unfortunately there is often an over-reliance on expensive, overseas consultants. This project builds on eight years of collaboration between Kenyan and UK scientists with a track record of training for African colleagues. We will continue this tradition by training three students to masters level, by giving bespoke business and entrepreneurial training to help ensure follow-on funding and by working together on papers and new proposals. We have established an East African forum to ensure good regional communication on the science and practice of payments for ecosystem services. This will be further developed and new links with relevant experience in West Africa will be established.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/I003401/1,,,,,,,,Edinburgh Napier University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15339839,,

The efficiency of the integrated human factor analysis and decision support system is tested with data from a case study to generate a comprehensive priority rank, a robust sensitivity analysis, and other theoretical/practical insights.

The structure model and parameter model of DBNs for the degradation process caused by a single factor are established on the basis of theoretical or empirical physical models, thereby solving the problem of insufficient data. An RUL estimation model is subsequently established by integrating these degradation process models. The RUL value is obtained from the time difference between the detection point and predicted failure point, which is determined using the failure threshold of performance. The sensor data and expert knowledge can be input into the estimation model to update the RUL value whenever necessary. The subsea pipelines in offshore oil and gas subsea production systems are adopted to demonstrate the proposed methodology.

We analyzed 28 surface sediment samples obtained in June, 2002 to evaluate the level of toxicity in the littoral zone, port-harbor, and La Ventosa estuary in Bahia Salina Cruz. The extractable organic matter concentration was high (1213 to 7505 mu g g(-1)) in 5 of 7 stations from the port and harbor, whereas it was low in 12 of 16 stations in the littoral zone (36 to 98 mu g g(-1)). The total aromatic hydrocarbon concentration was highest (57 to 142 mu g g(-1)) in the port and harbor compared to the La Ventosa estuary and the littoral zone. Among the heavy metals analyzed, cadmium exceeded the effects range-low values associated with adverse biological effects. The geo-accumulation index of sediments was moderate to strong contamination at 5 stations in the nonlittoral and 6 stations in the littoral zone. The enrichment of lead, zinc, and cadmium at 5 stations from the littoral, port, and harbor suggest that these metals are of anthropogenic origin. Bioassay tests of elutriates of sediments on nauplii of Artemia franciscana and Artemia sp. showed that the port and harbor were more toxic than the La Ventosa estuary and the coastal zone.

The current study aimed to elucidate the factors affecting the onset of negative buoyancy and to also explore possible mechanisms behind buoyancy change. Embryos co-exposed to oil and/or increased temperature and UV radiation displayed early onset of negative buoyancy with concurrent increases in oxygen consumption and sinking rates, which are normally only seen during the period directly preceding hatch. Results also suggest a behavioral response in which embryos avoid UV radiation by sinking down the water column but reestablish positive buoyancy once the UV radiation is removed.

The hydrodynamic model using the Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) was constructed to examine the changes of tidal dynamics due to the variation of tidal flat slopes. According to the model results, a decreased slope of a tidal flat would amplify the M-2 tidal amplitude and delay the M-2 tidal phase in the inner harbor, due to an increased tidal prism, and vice versa. The amplitude of the main shallow-water tide M-4 would be amplified/dampened in the entire bay due to the changed bottom friction, if the tidal flat's slope were reduced/increased at the Tie inlet. The phase was advanced. The change of a tidal flat's slope at the Tie inlet had greater impacts on tidal amplitude, phase and duration asymmetry, than that at the Xihu inlet. The impact of changes of the tidal flat slope at the Xihu inlet was small and was constrained locally.

Carbon sources and feeding guilds were assessed from five Barbados seeps and three putative non-seep sites through carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses on numerically-dominant and/or high-biomass species. Thiotmphy and methanotmphy were both observed in Barbados seep symbiotrophs, although no taxa appeared to contain both types of endosymbionts. There was little evidence of incorporation of photosynthetically-derived carbon in the seep food webs except among the deposit feeding ophiuroids and a single sipunculid at the bathyal seep. It is hypothesized that there may be a maximum depth after which chemosynthesis becomes the dominant primary carbon source at seeps. In addition, raphitomid snails and thyasirid clams at two of the three sites that were categorized as non-seep had carbon signatures indicative of thiotrophy. Thus, chemosynthesis may be more widespread within the Barbados accretionary prism seep field than currently thought, potentially through a greater sphere of influence surrounding the seeps or as a result of the 'dark biosphere' of infaunal chemosynthetic organisms.

One argues that reduced tidal energy will increase inter-tidal sedimentation; the other suggests that reduced tidal propagation will trigger a period of erosion before accretion of inter-tidal resumes. This paper investigates the relevance of sills across UK estuaries and causeways and barriers across estuaries in the Bay of Fundy (Nova Scotia, Canada) as possible analogues. Particular attention is paid to the tidal power barrage at Annapolis Royal because it exhibits important features that provide the underpinning evidence for morphological responses within tidal power headponds.The construction of the tidal power plant at Annapolis Royal involved retro-fitting a tidal turbine and re-establishment of tidal influences into a headpond which had been maintained at a relatively constant level for some 24 years previously. The sequence of events at Annapolis Royal shows that headponds behave like river reservoirs, with bank erosion where sediments are weakly consolidated. It also demonstrates how resumption of tidal propagation can accelerate bank erosion; a process that is closely linked to wind-driven wave energy and the establishment of a foreshore profile that is better fitted to this energy regime. This model is very important both in the context of new tidal energy barrages and also for projects to retro-fit turbines into existing causeways. It reinforces the evidence from the Eastern Schelde in The Netherlands where it has been found that reduced tidal propagation has had profound effects on foreshore evolution with serious loss of mudflats and former saltmarshes. Annapolis Royal not only highlights erosionary processes; it also provides initial indications of the timescales required for evolution of more stable inter-tidal profiles.The evidence provided by these various examples has important implications for coastal managers. Firstly, they show how analogues can be used to develop a conceptual geomorphological model of possible responses to causeways, sills and barrages such as some of the options being considered for the Thames Estuary. In addition, they highlight issues that need to be taken into account when pre-project planning considers likely issues and long-term management implications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite a large body of research documenting invasive plant impacts, few studies have followed individual invaded sites over decades to observe how they change, and none have contrasted how compositional impacts from invasion compare to ecosystem-process impacts over a multi-decadal time-scale.2. Using direct measurements of plant density and composition and of ecosystems processes, we evaluate how ecosystem structure, above-ground net primary production (ANPP), and above-ground and soil nutrient pools compare over 25 years since fire and C4 grass invasions disrupted seasonally dry Hawaiian woodlands. We compare structure and function between primary woodland that has never burned and is largely native species-dominated, with sites that had been the same woodland type but burned in alien-grass-fuelled fires in the 1970s and 1980s. The sites have not experienced fires since 1987.3. We report here that woody plant composition and structure continue to be dramatically changed by the initial invasions and fires that occurred 25 years ago and invaders continue to dominate in burned sites. This is reflected in continued low plant carbon pools in burned compared to unburned sites. Yet ANPP and N storage, which were dramatically lower in the initial decade after invasive-grass fuelled fires, have increased and are now indistinguishable from values measured in intact woodlands. Soil carbon pools were resilient to both invasion and fire initially and over time.4. Above-ground net primary production has recovered because of invasion of burned sites by a non-native N-fixing tree rather than because of recovery of native species. This invasive N-fixing tree is unlikely to return C storage of the invaded sites to those of unburned woodland because of its tissue and growth characteristics and its interactions with invasive grasses. It does not facilitate native species but rather promotes a persistent invasive grass/N-fixer savanna.5. Synthesis. We conclude that fire, an unusual disturbance in this system, has perpetuated the dominance of these sites by invasive species and that despite the dramatic recovery of above-ground net primary production and N pools, the ecosystem continues to be in a distinctly different state than the pre-fire, pre-Melinis community. Thus, despite the absence of further disturbance (fire), there is no evidence that succession towards the original ecosystem is occurring. The fact that N pools and above-ground net primary production recover because of a new invader (Morella faya), highlights the unpredictability of ecosystem trajectories in the face of altered regional species pools.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,19,0,27,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,,,,,,,"UC Santa Barbara, Environm Studies Program, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUC Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUS Geol Survey, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, Hawaii Natl Pk, HI 96718 USANo Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",,,,2017-11-01,WOS:000413341700002,,

Using the C-13 isotope tracer from the invasion of a C-4 plant, Spartina alterniflora, into the native ecosystem originally covered by C-3 plants across Eastern Chinese coastal wetlands, we investigated a potential C stabilization process via soil structural protection. We quantified changes in soil aggregates, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (STN), and natural C-13 isotope abundance within aggregate fractions across a chronosequence of 0-, 4-, 8-, and 12-year S. alterniflora invasion. Our results showed that soil aggregate stability increased significantly along the chronosequence. Meanwhile, SOC and STN concentrations increased with invasion time in the whole soil and aggregate fractions, which were linked to increasing soil aggregate stability. The contribution of S. alterniflora-derived SOC increased from 18.96 to 40.24% in the 0-20cm layer and from 4.66 to 32.04% in the 20-40cm layer across the chronosequence from 4 to 12years with the highest proportion observed in macro-aggregates.

This paper develops a two-step approach to evaluate the effect of the revolution on efficiency in the global oilfield service (OFS) market, which can be divided into five segments. In the first step, a new semiparametric model is introduced to evaluate firm-level technical efficiencies assuming segment-specific production functions for each of the five segments. In the second step, this study tests if companies acquiring directional drilling (DD) and/or hydraulic fracturing (HF) techniques can maintain efficiency. The empirical results show that practicing just one of the techniques will decrease efficiency. However, combining the two can produce significant spillover effects and improve efficiency.

More recently, the role of phytoliths in soil carbon (C) storage and soil C and silicon (Si) cycling hasreceived increasing attention. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of recent land cover change on soil phytolith assemblage, soil phytolith concentration, and phytolith-occluded carbon (PhytOC) storage.Materials and methodsMineral soil samples (0-10cm) were collected from a tussock grassland (n=18) and an adjacent 32-year-old pine forest (n=21) in Otago, New Zealand. The pine forest was established on tussock grassland. Microwave digestion was followed by sedimentation and flotation procedures to obtain a purified phytolith extract to identify soil phytolith morphotypes by microscopy and to quantify PhytOC concentrations using an elemental analyzer.Results and discussionSoil phytolith assemblage was similar under tussock grassland and pine forest. Bulliform and short cells which were derived from grass species accounted for more than 80% of the phytoliths. Woody plant-derived phytoliths found under tussock grassland (1)may originate from shrubs which are encroaching into the tussock grassland and/or (2) are a legacy of the past woody-dominated vegetation. Soil phytolith concentration ranged between 1 and 3%. Soil PhytOC storage was 0.15kg C/m(2) and 0.14kg C/m(2) under tussock grassland and pine forest, respectively, and accounted for around 3% of total soilcarbon storage.ConclusionsSoil phytolith assemblage, soil phytolith concentration, and soil PhytOC storage did not differ significantly between the tussock grassland and the pine forest that was converted from tussock grassland recently. The dominance of grass-derived phytoliths under the pine forest may reflect the legacy of the tussock vegetation which dominated the study site before the afforestation with pine in 1992. This study also revealed that the intrinsic feature of tussock grassspecies and the accumulation of phytoliths over centuries is likely the cause for the high soil phytolith and PhytOCconcentrations.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,5,0,7,,,1439-0108,1614-7480,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1010, New ZealandQinghai Univ, 251 Ningda Rd, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R ChinaPlant & Food Res, Private Bag 92169, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",,,,2019-03-12,WOS:000459805400020,,

But our oceans are in decline. There is mounting pressure on finite marine resources because of the increasing number of competing activities, technological advances, and over-exploitation, pollution and climate change. Conflicts about how to harness benefits from marine resources are widespread, intensifying, and unfolding in unprecedented ways. There are long-standing disputes between activities like fisheries, and oil and gas exploitation. New conflicts are emerging, e.g., sea-level rise could displace millions on low-lyingcoasts, and submerge some small island nations. Ocean conflicts reflect deep-rooted struggles over ownership, rights, benefits, and human-nature relationships on our Blue Planet. Surprisingly, ocean conflict resolution is an under-developed field of scholarship and practice. OCEANS PACTargues that ocean sustainability prospects depend on building tailor-made capabilities to analyze, productively manage, and where possible transform ocean conflicts. We construct a co-designed, transdisciplinary, action research approach. We aim to develop deep insights about diverseocean conflicts through real-world collaboration of context-specific research teams that include stakeholder partners, social and natural scientists, and conflict resolution experts. Our comparative analysis focuses on conflicts that traverse the Global North and South, in South Africa, India, Brazil, Norway/Barents Sea, Baltic Sea and United States. We investigate how existing conflict resolution practices help or hinder ocean sustainability. We examine how formal interventions, e.g., law, and informal practices, e.g., negotiation, can be harnessed to unlock the transformative potential of conflict resolution. The new knowledge gained will be used to develop and test ocean conflict resolution tools and practices. OCEANS PACT will generate significant scientific, socio-political and practice benefits in our case studies, and enable scaling up of insights, tools and conflict resolution practices that foster global ocean sustainability.

Loss of saline wetlands due to relative sea‐level rise, land‐use change, and hydrologic alterations liberates previously stored C and reduces the capacity for future C sequestration. Widespread wetland loss has prompted marsh restoration and creation projects around the world; however, little is known about the timescale and capacity for created marshes to function as blue C sinks and the role of environmental conditions in mediating soil C accumulation in restoration sites. Using a chronosequence of five created saline marshes ranging in age from 5 to 32 yr and two adjacent natural reference marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA, short‐ and longer‐term C accumulation rates (SCAR and LCAR, respectively) were determined using feldspar marker horizons and peat depth in cores at six locations in each marsh. Created marshes ranged in elevation from 12 to 41 cm (NAVD88) and supported assorted plant community compositions driven by local environmental conditions. SCAR ranged from 75 to 430 g C·m 2 ·yr 1 , which were comparable in the two youngest and two oldest marshes. Longer‐term CAR ranged from 18 to 99 g C·m 2 ·yr 1 but did not significantly differ among marshes of different ages. Our findings indicate that LCAR in these created marshes were influenced by site‐specific environmental conditions (i.e., stem density and mineral sediment) rather than marsh age. Results suggest that conditions appropriate for the establishment of vegetation with high stem densities, such as Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, may facilitate higher LCAR in created marshes, which may be useful for restoration project planning and mitigation of climate change.

Although approximate methods of analysis exist for estimating the penetration resistance, these do not account for the distortion of the upper layer as it punches through into the lower layer and there has been only limited visual depiction of the failure mechanism that occurs for the case of strong clay overlying weaker soil. This paper reports results of centrifuge model tests undertaken to provide insight into spudcan foundation behaviour during undrained vertical penetration through a stronger clay layer into weaker material, varying the strength ratio between lower and upper soil layers, the thickness of the upper layer relative to the spudcan diameter and the strength gradient of the lower layer. The model tests included half-spudcan tests against a transparent window, allowing the soil flow to be captured continuously by a digital camera and subsequently quantified through particle image velocimetry (PIV) analysis, and separate full-spudcan tests to measure the penetration resistance. Four interesting aspects of the soil flow mechanisms were identified: (a) vertically downwards motion of the soil and consequent deformation of the layer interface; (b) trapping of the stronger material beneath the spudcan, with this material being carried down into the underlying soft layer; (c) delayed back-flow of soil around the spudcan into the cavity formed above the spudcan; (d) eventual localised flow around the embedded spudcan. The effect of normalised layer soil properties and geometry on the soil flow mechanisms and the form of the penetration resistance profile is discussed in the context of the likelihood and severity of punch-through failure. Typical critical failure modes involved punching shear, with clear shear planes in the shape of a truncated cone forming in the upper layer below the spudcan. Potential punch-through, with a peak in penetration resistance followed by some reduction, occurred for almost all cases investigated. The reduction in resistance became more severe as the strength ratio of the underlying layer to the upper layer reduced, and also as the upper layer thickness increased. The failure modes assumed by the currently available recommended practices are not consistent with those observed from the study, suggesting a more rational approach is needed.",,,,,,,,,60,7,0,0,0,0,66,,,0016-8505,1751-7656,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, COFS, Crawley, Australia",,,,2010-03-01,WOS:000275589000001,,

Many of these pose acute risks to marine wildlife; for example, tidal energy generators have the potential to injure or kill seals and small cetaceans through collisions with moving turbine parts. Information on fine scale behaviour of animals close to operational turbines is required to understand the likely impact of these new technologies. There are inherent challenges associated with measuring the underwater movements of marine animals which have, so far, limited data collection. Here, we describe the development and application of a system for monitoring the three-dimensional movements of cetaceans in the immediate vicinity of a subsea structure. The system comprises twelve hydrophones and software for the detection and localisation of vocal marine mammals. We present data demonstrating the systems practical performance during a deployment on an operational tidal turbine between October 2017 and October 2019. Three-dimensional locations of cetaceans were derived from the passive acoustic data using time of arrival differences on each hydrophone. Localisation accuracy was assessed with an artificial sound source at known locations and a refined method of error estimation is presented. Calibration trials show that the system can accurately localise sounds to 2m accuracy within 20m of the turbine but that localisations become highly inaccurate at distances greater than 35m. The system is currently being used to provide data on rates of encounters between cetaceans and the turbine and to provide high resolution tracking data for animals close to the turbine. These data can be used to inform stakeholders and regulators on the likely impact of tidal turbines on cetaceans.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of St Andrews,,,,2022-11-15,PPRN:10103716,,

J,,,,,,,,,Stephen Bowden,,"Modelling the Deep Biosphere over Deep Geological time at the Nankai Trough, Japan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Dec 10 2016,2016,"Recent work has demonstrated that microbes living within deep ocean sedimentary rocks can be descended from the organisms present within the rock's depositional environment. This implies that the microbes experienced a long geological history and in many cases the microbes experienced significant changes in their environment as the sediment was buried and converted to rock.Computer models of the conversion of sediments into sedimentary rock have been adapted to model the life and death of individual biomes within their host geological formations. However, to date, this has only been done for examples of sub-seafloor cases where there is little movement of groundwater or other fluids between geological formations. However, there are many instances where the transfer of fluids between formations occurs. Examples include oil and gas migration, as well as the catastrophic movement of fluids associated with earthquakes and tectonic activity. The Nankai trough is one such place where both process may occur and subsurface microbes have been detected at depth. At the moment current models of microbes living within sediments can not accurately model the transfer of microbes between geological horizons, and this would prohibit the modelling deep subsurface biomes in these important environments.An IODP expedition to the Nankai trough will explore the subsurface to investigate the temperature limits of life. This expedition will provide an opportunity to acquire data that will be used to develop better models of the deep biosphere that incorporate the subsurface movement of cells. To achieve this it is necessary to have access to important data characterizing the microbial populations found in the Nankai trough. It is also essential that the boundaries between geological formations, and migration pathways for microbes within the subsurface are recorded and described. To accurately model past temperatures experienced by microbes as their host sediment is converted into rock, it is necessary to make geochemical measurements that record past episodes of thermal alteration. The type of measurement needed depends on the temperatures concerned, and in this case measurements must span a considerable temperature range including mild temperatures experienced in the near surface, as well as the higher temperatures that generate oil and gas. This later group is common practice for scientists the former is not.Observations of the boundaries between geological formations must be parameterised; e.g. converted into numerical inputs that can be put into a model. Two things need to be parameterised: 1) Basic information describing how the boundaries permit the passage of fluids. These are routine measurements that are easily made. 2) How different rock textures interact with cells as they move through rocks. This is not common information and will be determined by experiments that take account of specific circumstances appropriate to the Nankai trough sediments; e.g. the presence of gases and fluids, and specific rock textures.Models built using this data can then be used for addressing fundamental science questions concerning life in the deep subsurface, life on other planetary bodies and the evolution of life over geological time. They will also have practical applications for predicting petroleum occurrences and forward modelling microbial enhanced oil recovery and contaminated ground remediation.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/P015182/1,,,,,,,,University of Aberdeen,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15325693,,

This has resulted in frequent prolonged projects, schedule delay, and consequently significant cost overruns. Existing literature has identified one of the major causes of project delays to be the lack of adequate tools or techniques to diagnose the appropriateness and sufficiency of the contract deadline proposed by project owners prior to signing the contract in the bid. As such, this paper seeks to propose appropriate or correct project durations using the research methodology of text mining for bid documents. With the emergence of big data' research, text mining has become an acceptable research strategy, having already been utilized in various industries including medicine, legal, and securities. In this study the scope of work (SOW), as a main part of EPC contracts is analyzed using text mining processes in a sequence of pre-processing, structuring, and normalizing. Lessons learned, collected from 13 executed off shore EPC projects, are then used to reinforce the findings from said process. For this study, critical terms (CT), representing the root of past problems, are selected from the reports of lessons learned. The occurrence of the CT in the SOW are then counted and converted to a schedule delay risk index (SDRI) for the sample projects. The measured SDRI of each sample project are then correlated to the project's actual schedule delay via regression analysis. The resultant regression model is entitled the schedule delay estimate model (SDEM) for this paper based on the case studies. Finally, the developed SDEM's accuracy is validated through its use to predict schedule delays on recently executed projects with the findings being compared with actual schedule performance. This study found the relationship between the SDRI, frequency of CTs in the SOW, and delays to be represented by the regression formula. Through assessing its performance with respect to the 13th project, said formula was found to have an accuracy of 81%. As can be seen, this study found that more CTs in the SOW leads to a higher tendency for a schedule delay. Therefore, a higher project SDRI implies that there are more issues on projects which required more time to resolve them. While the low number of projects used to develop the model reduces its generalizability, the text mining research methodology used to quantitatively estimate project schedule delay can be generalized and applied to other industries where contractual documents and information regarding lessons learned are available.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,0,16,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,,"HHI, Project Management Team, 400 Bangeojinsunhwan Doro, Ulsan 44114, South KoreaPohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Grad Sch Engn Mastership GEM, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, South KoreaPohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Dept Ind & Management Engn, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, South Korea",HHI,,,2019-06-27,WOS:000471016700135,,

Such assessments are used to ensure better decisions for repair and/or replacement to reduce pipelines' failure possibilities. Therefore, it is essential to have an effective condition assessment model for pipelines as their failure incidents may lead to catastrophic, economical, and environmental consequences. Current practices of assessing gas pipelines condition can be considered simplified for the intended purpose. They mainly depend on experts' opinions in interpreting inspection data, where the process is influenced by human subjectivity and reasoning uncertainty. In other words, they need detailed knowledge on the translation of raw inspection data into valuable information. This will surely lead to decisions lacking thorough and extensive review of the most influential aspects on pipelines' conditions. To address the weaknesses of current practices, this research proposes a new fuzzy-based methodology that utilizes an integrated analytic network process (ANP) and hierarchical evidential reasoning (HER) to develop a meticulous condition assessment model for offshore gas pipelines. The proposed model is validated using historical inspection reports that are obtained from a local pipeline operator in Qatar. The model delivers satisfactory outcomes in assessing offshore gas pipelines' conditions based on real field data.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,0887-3828,1943-5509,,,,,,,,,,"Qatar Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Doha 2713, QatarConcordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada",,,,2016-12-21,WOS:000388619000004,,

In this study, by using the literature data, it was aimed to understand whether the Mediterranean Sea includes necessary parameters for producible gas hydrate reservoirs. It was shown that the Mediterranean Sea contains all of these parameters (source gas, appropriate pressure and temperature, coarse sand potential, etc.). The only bottom-simulating reflections (BSRs) were detected in the Nile Delta of the Mediterranean Sea. In the conditions of these BSRs, the gas production potentials from Class 1 hydrate and Class 3 hydrate were analyzed by applying depressurization method with and without wellbore heating at 50 degrees C with HydrateResSim numerical simulator. It was observed that both gas hydrate layer in Class 1 and gas hydrate in Class 3 hydrate dissociated fully. However, the contribution of free gas layer in Class 1 hydrate on cumulative gas production was enormous so it was stated much more exploration studies are necessary in the Mediterranean Sea to detect Class 1 hydrates and BSRs. During the simulations, ice formations along the wellbores were not detected for both Class 1 hydrate and Class 3 hydrate. Hydrate reformation at 3.5 MPa and below 3.5 MPa in Class 3 hydrate was observed along the wellbore but the wellbore heating at 50 degrees C was enough to avoid gas hydrate reformation along the wellbore. The warm temperature of the sediments of the Mediterranean Sea was advantageous for effective depressurization. However, it was proved that methane-carbon dioxide replacement method is not applicable for the potential Mediterranean Sea gas hydrates due to the warm seafloor temperature (similar to 14 degrees C) of the Mediterranean Sea.",,,,,,,,,35,1,0,0,1,0,36,,,1875-5100,2212-3865,,,,,,,,,,"Batman Univ, Dept Petr & Nat Gas Engn, Batman, TurkeyMiddle East Tech Univ, Dept Petr & Nat Gas Engn, Ankara, Turkey",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000432092600018,,

Relative sea-level fall, probably driven by events associated with the early development and evolution of the Iceland plume, enabled a Late Palaeocene-Early Eocene coarsening-up deltaic system to initially prograde and offlap as part of a forced regressive wedge. Coeval and subsequent erosion led to deep (>250 m) incision of the delta and formation of a significant drainage system consisting initially of a dendritic incised valley network and a major, deep, low sinuosity channel, all of which fed sediment into distal parts of the basin. The highly localised nature of major incision, the area's situation above the known occurrence of a buried Late Caledonian granitic intrusion (the Bressay Granite) and coincident fault reactivation combine to suggest that the regional transient plume-related uplift was locally enhanced by Late Palaeocene-Early Eocene tectonic uplift of a previously suppressed crustal root. Subsequent Early-Mid Eocene sea-level rise, coeval with North Atlantic opening, caused transgressive backfill of the erosional (palaeogeomorphic) relief and drape of the elastic wedge by tuffaceous marine mudstones of the Balder Formation.Two, distinctive and mutually exclusive palaeogeomorphic play types have resulted. Structural relief on the delta top incision surface combines with either the onlapping, fine-grained tuffaceous valley fill or compactional drape above the coarse axial fill of the main low-sinuosity channel system to form good reservoir-seal pairs. A third closure exists in association with activity on a prominent reverse fault that also appears to have initiated in response to the rejuvenation of the Bressay Granite. Present-day hydrocarbon charge from the basin and the occurrence of heavy oil and gas in both of the subtle stratigraphic trap types and the independent structural closure, may encourage further exploration for similar features on the East Shetland Platform. Comparison with neighbouring areas suggests that similar palaeogeomorphic play types might be expected to occur in other Early Cenozoic basin margin locations in the North Sea and the West Shetlands, albeit on a smaller scale than the locally enhanced, tectonically driven incision seen in the Bressay area.

In this paper, we develop some hypotheses regarding the factors that may explain this variation. The aim of this paper is to improve safety in helicopter transportation through better understanding of the causes leading to fatal accidents. We provide an analysis of three segments of helicopter transportation in Norway (i.e., offshore transportation; onshore ambulance/police, and onshore transportation). This analysis refers to international research on helicopter accidents. The number of fatal accidents per million flight hours in Norwegian offshore helicopter transportation was 2.8 in 1990-1999 and zero in 2000-2015. In Norwegian onshore helicopter transportation, the fatal accident rate was 13.8 in the period 2000-2012. Twenty-three onshore helicopters crashed to the ground; seven of these crashes were fatal, killing 16 people. It is reasonable to question why there is such a significant difference in accident rates between offshore and onshore helicopter transportation. We have approached this question by comparing how the different segments of helicopter transportation are organized and managed. Our analysis shows that there are major differences both at the sharp end (i.e., in actual operations) and the blunt end (i.e., rules, regulations and organization). This includes differences in regulations, market conditions, work organization (i.e., training, employment conditions, and qualifications of the crews), operations and technology. A central argument is that differences in the market conditions and requirements stipulated by the users explain some of these differences. The same differences can be found internationally. If we use best practice and expert judgments, there is an opportunity to improve helicopter safety through improving the socio-technical system (i.e., organizational issues, improved design, improved maintenance of critical components and more focus on operational factors). A reasonable goal is that the international helicopter transportation industry could reduce the accident level to less than one fatal accident per million flight hours (Considering the oil and gas industry internationally, this would reduce the average of 24 fatalities annually to 4 per year, thus saving 20 lives each year).",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,7,,,2313-576X,,,,,,,,,,,"NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NO-7491 Trondheim, NorwaySINTEF, NO-7465 Trondheim, NorwaySafetec Nord AS, NO-7037 Trondheim, Norway",Safetec Nord AS,,,2018-06-19,WOS:000428668800004,,

Top basement/base sediment has been interpreted around the full extent of the seismic dataset This has produced a model for the thickness of the sediment fill within the basin which is thicker than previous published estimates.The new sediment-thickness model has been incorporated into a 3D backstripping study, producing maps of subsidence and thinning factor. Analysis of backstripped subsidence shows the thinning factor reaching peak values of c. 0.8-0.85 (beta factor >5) in the south-central axial area, reducing in magnitude northwards to c. 0.7. The new sediment-thickness model has also been incorporated into a 3D gravity-inversion study, mapping Moho depth, crustal thickness and thinning/stretching factor. The results show crustal-basement thickness reduced to c. 6 km, thinning factor c. 0.8, in the south-central area, while it spans the range c. 6-10 km further north. The results are compatible with previous seismic refraction work in both the UK and Irish sectors of the Rockall Basin. We believe that the extension which created the basin was non-magmatic and that the axial region is underlain by highly-thinned continental crust.The results from the gravity inversion have been used to make predictions about the top-basement heat-flow history. Heat flow in the basin centre is predicted to have been initially high, reducing with time, associated with cooling of the transient synrift heat-flow anomaly. On the basin flanks heat flow was less variable over time, its magnitude controlled primarily by constant radiogenic heat input from the basement, rather than by the transient geotherm anomaly.There remain considerable uncertainties associated with our interpretation and analysis. These uncertainties have been addressed with sensitivity analyses.A regional gravity-inversion model, using the new sediment-thickness data spliced into regional public-domain information, shows that structural and stretching continuity can be mapped at the crustal scale along the full length of the UK/Irish Rockall Basin, contrary to conclusions from some previous studies.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,13,,,1354-0793,,,,,,,,,,,"Badley Geosci Ltd, North Beck House,North Beck Lane, Spilsby PE23 5NB, Lincs, EnglandUniv Liverpool, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",Badley Geosci Ltd,,,2019-06-04,WOS:000466370700001,,

At the 1200 m isobath, notable social interactions were observed in which four adult individuals performed breaching - the first report of this behavioural pattern for Brazil.

Aspects of serum chemistry, stored metabolites and gill morphology were used to gain further insight into the biochemical, physiological and morphological alterations that take place following low salinity exposure of a marine fish. Rapid (<1 h) reductions in serum [Cl-] occurred while serum [Na+] exhibited only transient perturbations during initial exposure. Serum total [Ca] declined 24 h after exposure and returned to pre-exposure levels by 120 h. Despite a tendency for muscle moisture to increase during the early stages of low salinity exposure to significant change could be detected. The response of the branchial chloride cell (CC) was rapid, with epical and fractional exposure area increasing after 6 h. The number of CCs exposed at the branchial surface reduced after 6 h but subsequently increased to elevated levels. Serum cortisol levels had increased three fold I h after hyposmotic exposure and stabilised at pre-exposure levels within 12-24 h. Serum triiodothyronine (T-3) levels exhibited a biphasic response, significantly elevating and decreasing after 3 and 6 h respectively. Significant post-hyposmotic exposure elevations in serum glucose and protein occurred after 1 h, peaking at 3 h and returning to lower levels after 6 h. Total free ninhydrin reactive substances were significantly elevated 3 h post-hyposmotic exposure, a phenomenon attributable to elevated levels of ammonia, alanine, arginine, glycine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, serine, taurine, threonine and valine.

It was found that more negative safety climate scores were associated with increasing numbers of HC leaks over a 12-month period following the survey. The safety climate indicator explained more of the variance in HC leaks than technical indicators. HC leaks in the 12-month period preceding the survey did also correlate significantly with the safety climate indicator. More HC leaks during this period were associated with worse scores on the safety climate indicator. Thus, the results support that the safety climate measure could serve as leading and lagging indicator for HC leaks. The results and their possible implications are discussed. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The study of the methods for cleaning up oil spills is a critical issue to protect the environment. Various techniques are available to contain oil spills, but they are typically time consuming, energy inefficient and create secondary pollution. The use of a sorbent, such as a nanofibre sorbent, is a technique for controlling oil spills because of its good physical and oil sorption properties. This review discusses about the application of nanofibre sorbent for oil removal from water and its current developments. With their unique physical and mechanical properties coupled with their very high surface area and small pore sizes, nanofibre sorbents are alternative materials for cleaning up oil spills.

Fluvial saline aquifers are favourite targeted reservoirs for CO2 storage. These reservoirs are very heterogeneous but their heterogeneities were rarely integrated into CO2 reservoir models. Moreover, contrary to petroleum reservoirs, the available dataset is very limited and not supposed to be enriched. This leads to wide uncertainties on reservoir characteristics required for CSS management (injection location, CO2 plume migration, etc.). Stochastic simulations are classical strategies in such under-constrained context. They aim at generating a wide number of models that all fit the available dataset. The generated models serve as support for computing the required reservoir characteristics and their uncertainties. A challenge is to optimize the uncertainty computations by selecting stochastic models that should have a priori very different flow behaviours. Fluid flows depend on the connectivity of reservoir rocks (channel deposits). In this paper, it is proposed to study the variability of the Betti numbers in function of different fluvial architectures. The aim is to quantify the impact of fluvial heterogeneities and their spatial distribution on reservoir rock topology and then on CO2 storage capacities. Representative models of different scenarios of channel stacking and their internal heterogeneities are generated using geostatistical simulation approaches.

The first step was a REGIME multi-criteria decision analysis used to prioritize alternative LNG terminal locations. Then, multiple modes (railroad and pipeline) of transportation connections were evaluated and geometric alignments were proposed, considering a multitude of restrictions.

With different injecting velocities at the flushing inlet, the sediments distribution in the ballast tank is investigated and the energy consumption of the circulating pump is studied. The results show that by flushing the ballast water on the bottom, the sediments first accumulate at the far end, with the sediments volume fraction climbs up to 10-30%, before gradually getting removed over time. Further, higher inlet velocity leads to a more rapid decrease of average sediments proportion in the ballast tank over time, but the energy consumption in circulating pump significantly increases as well.

Thus, it requires a lot of efforts, supporting policies, and a great deal of competent human resources to achieve this ambitious target. Fulfilling the need for qualified geothermal human resources will take a significant amount of time if it only relies on higher education graduates. Hence, vocational education institutions especially training centers are expected to contribute more to meet these needs. The government has issued a regulation on the Indonesian National Work Competency Standards (SKKNI) which covers aspects of knowledge, skills and work attitudes relevant to the implementation of assigned duties and terms including SKKNI of onshore drilling which is used as a reference for oil and gas and geothermal drilling. However, previous studies have identified the differences between geothermal drilling and oil and gas drilling. This might be due to the government still considers that those two are similar, so they only issued one competency standard for both fields. This paper discusses the implementation of SKKNI on onshore drilling competency standard to produce geothermal drilling curricula. The first part of this paper will map the current conditions of Indonesia's geothermal drilling human resources development including the estimated number of human resources needed. Furthermore, this study highlights the fundamental differences between the hydrocarbon and geothermal drilling to provide a better understanding of the competency needs of labor in the geothermal industry.

The key factors are crucial components of a safety performance evaluation framework and each key safety factor corresponds to a list of underlying safety indicators. Method: In this study, participating industrial practitioners rated the compliance status of each indicator using a numbering system adapted from the traffic light system, based on the actual performance of 10 oil platforms in Malaysia. Safety scores of the platforms were calculated based on the ratings and compared with the actual lagging performance of the platforms. Safety scores of two platforms were compared with the facility status reports' findings of the respective platforms. Results: The platforms studied generally had good performance. Total recordable incident rates of the platforms were found to show significant negative correlations with management and work engagement on safety, compliance score for number of incident and near misses, personal safety, and management of change. Lost time injury rates, however, correlated negatively with hazard identification and risk assessment. The safety scores generally agreed with findings of the facility status reports with substandard process containment found as a contributor of hydrocarbon leaks. Conclusions: This study proves the criterion validity of the safety performance evaluation framework and demonstrates its usability for benchmarking and continuous improvement of safety practices on the Malaysian offshore oil and gas platforms. Practical applications: This study reveals the applicability of the framework and the potential of extending safety reporting beyond the few conventional lagging safety performance indicators used. The study also highlights the synergy between correlating safety factors to streamline safety management on offshore platforms. (C) 2018 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

Such processes can inform strategies for human timescale carbon storage to mitigate climate change impacts and thus more detailed knowledge of sulfur incorporation into biomass species is needed. Until recently, detailed chemical characterization of sulfurized organic matter was only possible by analyzing individual building blocks obtained after desulfurization reactions. In this study, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS), with atmospheric pressure photoionization in positive ion mode, (+) APPI, was used to investigate the chemical composition of sulfur rich crude oils and to obtain mechanistic insights into the sulfur incorporation reactions happening during early diagenesis. Contrary to expectations, (+) APPI FTICR-MS data show that sulfurized lipids (with up to 6 sulfur atoms and up to m/z 1100) occur as free molecules in these oils, rather than within a macromolecular network linked by (poly)sulfide bridges. In contrast to the mature Peace River (Canada) oils, the thermally immature Rozel Point (USA) and Jianghan Basin (China) oils show a carbon number preference in sulfurized species resembling biogenic precursor molecules, which highlights the importance of S-bound molecules as geochemical proxies for early diagenetic processes. This study indicates that sulfur incorporation reactions involve the formation of S-cyclic structures in which the double bond equivalent is >= the number of S atoms. Collision induced dissociation (CID-) FTICR-MS experiments suggest the occurrence of intermolecular sulfur incorporation reactions, but only as a mechanism that is secondary to intramolecular sulfur addition. The CID-FTICR-MS experiments indicated that steroid sulfurization typically yields S-bearing cyclic structures and that thiol/thioether groups may be present throughout the chemical matrix but only to a minor extent. In addition, CID-FTICR-MS also confirms the occurrence of sulfurized alke-nones in low maturity oils. Knowledge of organic sulfur molecule formation informs routes for carbon dioxide removal technologies that could be used to sequester carbon in the geosphere and/or hydrosphere in the form of recalcitrant organic species.

Naturally occurring microbes can degrade oil, but the rate of oil degradation depends heavily on the key chemical and biological factors. The goal of this study was to determine the influence of interactions between marsh plants and nitrogen (N) on the degradation of oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Oil disappearance was measured with gas chromatography (GC) focusing on the change in C-18 n-alkane-to-phytane ratio of oil, and instantaneous oil degradation rates were measured using an instantaneous carbon isotopic partitioning method. N addition often stimulates oil decomposition in soil slurries, but the effect of N in our mesocosms depended on plant species. N addition accelerated oil degradation in Spartina alterniflora mesocosms but slowed oil degradation in Spartina patens mesocosms. Across all plant and N treatments, oil degradation related to plant root growth. In many ecosystems including marshes, N addition has been shown to diminish root growth by reducing the need for nutrient foraging. Where N addition reduces root growth, N may ultimately exacerbate oxygen scarcity in marsh soils possibly negating or reversing the positive, direct effects that N has on oil degradation. Based on these findings, fertilization strategies that maximize marsh plant root growth will be the most effective at increasing the microbial degradation of oil and will have the greatest potential to mitigate the impacts of oil in marsh ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,2150-8925,,,,,,,,,,,"Villanova Univ, Dept Biol, Villanova, PA 19003 USAHaverford Coll, Dept Chem, Haverford, PA 19041 USATulane Univ, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",,,,2015-08-26,WOS:000358991500020,,

To supplement national monitoring programmes, government and industry have commissioned work on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in several United Kingdom estuaries, including Milford Haven Waterway, Southampton Water and Sullom Voe. These areas have some of the longest-established and largest oil industry sites in the UK, and they have been monitored intensively and successfully through most of their histories as oil, gas and petrochemicals ports. However, few economically and ecologically important UK estuaries and coastal zones have a particularly long history of advanced chemical fingerprinting to assist monitoring the specific sources, fates and effects of sediment hydrocarbons. As such, the UK approach has not compared well with the efforts of the United States of America in terms of apportionment of contaminant sources, albeit driven in part by the latter's focus on litigation. As well as distinguishing natural and anthropogenic inputs from background conditions, hydrocarbon fingerprinting methods can directly improve the ability to discriminate between individual hydrocarbon sources using knowledge of their composition, age and relative weathering. An understanding of the manufacturing processes and their chronology can help discriminate among multiple sources of pollutant hydrocarbons and also contribute to life cycle analysis and studies of product footprints. There is a need to track the ubiquity, fate, persistence and effects of hydrocarbons and petrochemicals in the environment. However, the use of fingerprinting faces challenges that include high cost, potentially unwelcome discovery of liability,sediment movements and patchiness, biodegradation effects on clarity of the fingerprint, and over-printing by chronic inputs from non-point sources such as air pollution and river runoff.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,2345-7651,,978-981-10-0201-4; 978-981-10-0199-4,,,,,,,,,"Environm Consultancy, Cambridge CB24 4RL, EnglandEnvironm Geochem Consulting, Moorpark, CA 93021 USA",Environm ConsultancyEnvironm Geochem Consulting,,,2017-01-01,WOS:000460668500002,,

A significant enrichment of distinct microbial populations was observed, yet, little is known about the abundance and richness of specific microbial ecotypes involved in gas, oil and dispersant biodegradation in the wake of oil spills. Here, we document a previously unrecognized diversity of closely related taxa affiliating with Cycloclasticus, Colwellia and Oceanospirillaceae and describe their spatio-temporal distribution in the Gulf's deepwater, in close proximity to the discharge site and at increasing distance from it, before, during and after the discharge. A highly sensitive, computational method (oligotyping) applied to a data set generated from 454-tag pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene V4-V6 regions, enabled the detection of population dynamics at the sub-operational taxonomic unit level (0.2% sequence similarity). The biogeochemical signature of the deep-sea samples was assessed via total cell counts, concentrations of short-chain alkanes (C-1-C-5), nutrients, (colored) dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, as well as methane oxidation rates. Statistical analysis elucidated environmental factors that shaped ecologically relevant dynamics of oligotypes, which likely represent distinct ecotypes. Major hydrocarbon degraders, adapted to the slow-diffusive natural hydrocarbon seepage in the Gulf of Mexico, appeared unable to cope with the conditions encountered during the DWH spill or were outcompeted. In contrast, diverse, rare taxa increased rapidly in abundance, underscoring the importance of specialized sub-populations and potential ecotypes during massive deep-sea oil discharges and perhaps other large-scale perturbations.",,,,,,,,,110,3,0,0,90,1,126,,,1751-7362,1751-7370,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Room 220 Marine Sci Bldg, Athens, GA 30602 USAMarine Biol Lab, Josephine Bay Paul Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USAGeorgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USAUniv Tubingen, Ctr Appl Geosci, Morgenstelle 1, D-72074 Tubingen, GermanyUniv Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USAInter Amer Univ Puerto Rico, Ctr Environm Educ Conservat & Res, San Juan, PR USA",,,,2016-02-10,WOS:000368561100011,26230048,

It has also been reported that P. oceanica meadows can accumulate large stocks of belowground detritus due to slow decomposition rates. However, the generality of these results across broad spatial scales is poorly known. In this report, we examine the fate of leaf production and the magnitude and dynamics of belowground detritus in 16 P. oceanica meadows distributed along the Spanish Mediterranean. Herbivores removed a small percentage of leaf production in all the meadows (less than or equal to 13%), with most leaf production (> 85%) being shed after senescence. Most shed leaves (> 90%) were exported off the meadows by physical agents, such as waves and currents. The amount of belowground detritus stored within 10-15 cm from the sediment surface varied from ca. 70 to 7500 g DW m(-2) among the meadows examined, and they accumulated at rates ranging from ca. 65 to 650 g DW m(-2) per year. These values are large when compared to other communities of aquatic and terrestrial macrophytes. Our results show that P. oceanica meadows in the Spanish Mediterranean support high values of secondary production in other systems by exporting large amounts of leaf detritus as well as acting as substantial carbon sinks by accumulating large reservoirs of belowground detritus. Therefore, the increasing anthropogenic threats on P, oceanica could entail an important loss of secondary production and carbon storage in Mediterranean coastal ecosystems.

Along with the liberalization of the perennial tree sector, there are increased fluctuations of cocoa income. At the same time, the demand and interest for timber production and non-wood forest products have also been increasing. With the continuous disappearance of natural forests, the production of these commodities is being shifted into cocoa agroforests and plantations. In view of helping research and development institutions in promoting sustainable tree crop systems, this paper attempts, for the main cocoa producing countries of West Africa (Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire), to: (1) document the temporal evolution of the market demand for forests and non-wood forest products both at the local and international levels; (2) explore the set of tree species that can be produced in cocoa agroforests of WCA to satisfy this demand. Deforestation resulting partly from the expansion of perennial orchards and slash and burn agriculture is: (i) leading to a shortage of suitable forest land necessary to stabilize or increase national cocoa production and (ii) increasing the gap between the demand and availability/supply of non-wood forest products(NWFP) and timber by reducing the main source of these products-the forest. Demand of these products is increasing with the growth of urban and peri-urban centers. At the same time, perennial agroforestry systems such as cocoa agroforest are increasingly perceived as assets for Payment for Environmental Services (PES) such as carbon storage and biodiversity conservation, because of the potential of the resources that they can generate. These demands of products and payment for ecosystem services that can be provided by sustainable cocoa agroforestry systems depends upon the appropriate combination of cocoa, timber and non-timber forest trees on the same land. Such demands is still to be properly exploited in the region. Cocoa agroforests in West Africa are characterized by fewer species than those of Central Africa. The level of market access influences the types of species that are managed inside cocoa agroforests. Among the species potentially associable with cocoa, those demanded by the local, regional and international markets are not necessarily the ones that are more frequent in the cocoa fields. The gradual reduction of natural forest, from which timber and non-timber products are gathered, aroused the need to integrate the growing of such species in cocoa agroforestry systems.",,,,,,,,,33,1,0,0,23,0,34,,,0167-4366,1572-9680,,,,,,,,,,"Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Yaounde, Messa, CameroonInt Inst Trop Agr, STCP, Ibadan, NigeriaBiovers Int, Rome, ItalyRain Forest Alliance, Wageningen, NetherlandsUniv Bonn, Unit Trop Crops, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat, INRES Inst Nutzpflanzenwissensch & Ressourcenschu, D-53121 Bonn, GermanyMars Inc, Mclean, VA USAUniv Calif Davis, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USAWorld Agroforestry Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya",Rain Forest Alliance,,,2014-12-24,WOS:000345329300005,,

According to the data processed in this study, the wind power has values in the range 47.1 W/m(2) (Borneo) - 1430 W/m(2) (Greenland), while for the wave power a minimum value of 2.28 kW/m is noticed close to Sulawesi, compared to a maximum of 68.8 kW/m encountered close to Tasmania. As a next step, the performances of several wind and wave generators were evaluated. Thus, a wind farm may reduce the emissions with a maximum 84% in the case of Madagascar, or 88% near Iceland, while from the wave converters, only the Wave Dragon may reduce about 8% in Ireland or, on the other hand 86% in Iceland. In the final part of the work, the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) was also assessed. Thus, it was estimated that for some sites the wind systems already satisfy the EU target for the year 2025 of 0.11 USD/kWh, compared to the wave systems that still have a high electricity price being quite far from these targets.

In an effort to prevent the oil from rising to the surface, synthetic dispersants were applied at the wellhead. However, uncertainties in the formation of oil droplets and difficulties in measuring their size in the water column, complicated further assessment of the potential effect of the dispersant on the subsea-to-surface oil partition. We adapted a coupled hydrodynamic and stochastic buoyant particle-tracking model to the transport and fate of hydrocarbon fractions and simulated the far-field transport of the oil from the intrusion depth. The evaluated model represented a baseline for numerical experiments where we varied the distributions of particle sizes and thus oil mass. The experiments allowed to quantify the relative effects of chemical dispersion, vertical currents, and inertial buoyancy motion on oil rise velocities. We present a plausible model scenario, where some oil is trapped at depth through shear emulsification due to the particular conditions of the Macondo blowout. Assuming effective mixing of the synthetic dispersants at the wellhead, the model indicates that the submerged oil mass is shifted deeper, decreasing only marginally the amount of oil surfacing. In this scenario, the oil rises slowly to the surface or stays immersed. This suggests that other mechanisms may have contributed to the rapid surfacing of oil-gas mixture observed initially. The study also reveals local topographic and hydrodynamic processes that influence the oil transport in eddies and multiple layers. This numerical approach provides novel insights on oil transport mechanisms from deep blowouts and on gauging the subsea use of synthetic dispersant in mitigating coastal damage.",,,,,,,,,133,2,0,0,80,0,153,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USAUniv Miami, CIMAS, Miami, FL 33149 USAColorado Sch Mines, Golden, CO 80401 USAColumbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USAUniv Miami, CCS, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USASUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",,,,2012-12-18,WOS:000312432200034,23167517,

It analyses responses to representative surveys of the Norwegian population on the desirability of various energy technologies such as hydroelectric dams, onshore and offshore wind energy, bioenergy plants and, for contrast, gas plants with and without carbon capture and storage. Our main focus is on the influence of party political preference on views of renewable energy.

The high variability of the environment may camouflage the anticipated anisotropic signal from a leak and there are a number of leak scenarios. Marine operations are also costly constraining the availability of measurements. A method based on heterogeneous leak scenarios and anisotropic predictions of chemical footprint under varying current conditions is presented. Through a cost function optimal placement of sensors can be given both for fixed installations and series of measurements during surveys. Ten fixed installations with an optimal layout is better than twenty placed successively at the locations with highest leakage probability. Hence, optimal localizations of installations offers cost reduction without compromising precision of a monitoring program, e.g. quantifying and reduce probabilities of false alarm under control. An optimal cruise plan for surveys, minimizing transit time and operational costs, can be achieved. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The speeds of the oil spill trajectories predicted by the model without tidal forcing were substantially faster than the observations; however, predictions taking into account the tides, including both tidal cycle and subtidal periods, were satisfactorily improved. Subtidal flow in the simulation without tides was stronger than in that with tides because of reduced frictional effects. Friction induced by tidal stress decelerated the southward subtidal flows driven by northwesterly winter winds along the Korean coast of the Yellow Sea. These results strongly suggest that in order to produce accurate predictions of oil spill trajectories, simulations must include tidal effects, such as variations within a tidal cycle and advections over longer time scales in tide-dominated areas.

Of particular interest is the use of NMPC for direct short-term production optimization, where two methods for (one-layer) production optimization in NMPC are investigated. The first method is the unreachable setpoints method where an unreachable set-point is used in order to maximize oil production. The ideas from this method are combined with the exact penalty function for soft constraints in a second method, named infeasible soft-constraints. Both methods can be implemented within standard NMPC software tools.The case-study first looks into the use of NMPC for 'conventional' pressure control, where disturbance rejection of time-varying disturbances (caused, e.g., by the 'slugging' phenomenon) is an issue. Then the above two methods for production optimization are employed, where both methods find the economically optimal operating point. Two different types of reservoir models are studied, using rate-independent and rate-dependent gas/oil ratios. These models lead to different types of optimums. The relative merits of the two methods for production optimization, and advantages of the two one-layer approaches compared to a two-layer structure, are-discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Potential capture sources have been identified and the potential for CO2 capture has been estimated based on branch- and plant-specific conditions. Emphasis is placed here on three branches of industry with promising prospects for CCS: mineral oil refineries, iron and steel, and cement manufacturers.Findings - A relatively small number (-270) of large installations (> 500,000 tCO(2)/year) dominates emissions from the three branches investigated in this study. Together these installations emit 432 MtCO(2)/year, 8 percent of EU's total greenhouse gas emissions. If the full potential of emerging CO2 capture technologies was realized, some 270-330 MtCO(2) emissions could be avoided annually. Further, several regions have been singled out as particularly suitable to facilitate integrated CO2 transport networks. The most promising prospects for an early deployment of CCS are found in the regions bordering the North Sea.Research limitations/implications - Replacement/retrofitting of the existing plant stock will involve large investments and deployment will take time. It is thus important to consider how the current industry structure influences the potential to reduce CO2 in the short-medium and long term. It is concluded that the age structure of the existing industry plant stock and its implications for the timing and deployment rate of CO2 capture and other mitigation measures are important and should therefore be further investigated.Practical implications - CCS has been recognized as a key option for reducing CO2 emissions within the EU. This assessment shows that considerable emission reductions could be achieved by targeting large point sources in some of the most emission-intensive industries. Yet, a number of challenges need to be resolved in all parts of the CCS chain. Efforts need to be intensified from all stakeholders to gain more experience with the technological, economical and social aspects of CCS.Originality/value - This study provides a first estimate of the potential role for CO2 capture technologies in lowering CO2 emissions from European heavy industry. By considering wider system aspects as well as plant-specific conditions the assessment made in this study gives a realistic overview of the prospects and practical limitations of CCS in EU industry.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,1,24,,,1477-7835,1758-6119,,,,,,,,,,"Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Energy & Environm Energy Technol, Div Energy Technol, Gothenburg, SwedenChalmers Univ Technol, Dept Energy & Environm Energy Technol, Div Energy Technol, Sustainable Energy Syst, Gothenburg, Sweden",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000415494300016,,

The Lennox structure is a rollover anticline in Permo-Triassic sediments formed in the hanging wall of the Formby Point Fault.

The structure is sealed by the overlying shales and evaporites of the Mercia Mudstone Group. To date four wells have been drilled on the Lennox Field and have delineated a free gas cap in communication with a constant thickness oil rim. The hydrocarbons have been sourced from Namurian Holywell shales and reflect complex migration into the Lennox structure. Reservoir studies indicate likely hydrocarbons-in-place of 463 BCF of gas and 218 MMBO of oil. Development approval for the Lennox Field was granted in 1993 with production due to commence in late 1995 from a series of horizontal oil producers.

Onshore storage offers increased flexibility and reduced infrastructure and monitoring costs. Enabling onshore storage will support management of decarbonisation strategies at territory level while enhancing security of energy supply and local economic activities, and securing jobs across Europe. However, successful onshore storage also requires overcoming some unique technical and societal challenges. ENOS will provide crucial advances to help foster onshore CO2 storage across Europe through:1. Developing, testing and demonstrating in the field, under real-life conditions, key technologies specifically adapted to onshore storage.2. Contributing to the creation of a favourable environment for onshore storage across Europe.The ENOS site portfolio will provide a great opportunity for demonstration of technologies for safe and environmentally sound storage at relevant scale. Best practices will be developed using experience gained from the field experiments with the participation of local stakeholders and the lay public. This will produce improved integrated research outcomes and increase stakeholder understanding and confidence in CO2 storage. In this improved framework, ENOS will catalyse new onshore pilot and demonstration projects in new locations and geological settings across Europe, taking into account the site-specific and local socio-economic context. By developing technologies from TRL4/5 to TRL6 across the storage lifecycle, feeding the resultant knowledge and experience into training and education and cooperating at the pan-European and global level, ENOS will have a decisive impact on innovation and build the confidence needed for enabling onshore CO2 storage in Europe.ENOS is initiating strong international collaboration between European researchers and their counterparts from the USA, Canada, South Korea, Australia and South Africa for sharing experience worldwide based on real-life onshore pilots and field experiments. Fostering experience-sharing and research alignment between existing sites is key to maximise the investment made at individual sites and to support the efficient large scale deployment of CCS. ENOS is striving to promote collaboration between sites in the world through a programme of site twinning, focus groups centered around operative issues and the creation of a leakage simulation alliance.

Specifically, the riser and well are connected at well head to constitute an outer pipe, within which, the drillstring stretching from the drilling platform to downhole is viewed as an inner pipe. The interactions between the inner and outer pipes are described by a series of spring-friction units along the pipe-in-pipe structure. Comparing with the previously published models which mainly focus on the drilling riser, the pipe-in-pipe structure is applied in this new model; moreover, the tube system under the mud line is also considered as an extension of the tube system submerged in the sea. The developed dynamic model is simulated using the finite element (FE) method in Abaqus. Under the same ocean environmental loads, the maximal lateral deflection for the pipe-in-pipe structure is less than that only considering the drilling riser. This finding indicates that, for an actual offshore drilling tube system with the pipe-in-pipe structure, it has stronger capacity of maintaining reliability under heavy ocean environmental loads. Based on the newly developed dynamic model, multi-objective optimization design of the offshore drilling tube system is conducted in Isight. A new flow path of the optimization is designed. Specifically, six-sigma method is adopted to drive genetic algorithm to run the multi-objective optimization, and simultaneously drive Monte Carlo method to analyze the reliability of the obtained optimal solution. Comparing with a series of single-objective optimization designs, the global optimization degree of the obtained multi-objective optimal design is verified as the best. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Some products of mineral dissolution would precipitate in soils or be taken up by ecosystems, but a significant portion would be transported to the coastal zone and the open ocean, where the increase in alkalinity would partially counteract ocean acidification associated with the current marked increase in atmospheric CO2. Other elements released during this mineral dissolution, like Si, P, or K, could stimulate biological productivity, further helping to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. On land, the terrestrial carbon pool would likely increase in response to Enhanced Weathering in areas where ecosystem growth rates are currently limited by one of the nutrients that would be released during mineral dissolution.

The majority of these platforms were installed before industry-wide design methods and criteria were established. As a result of California's 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, regulators have been developing a policy to address seismic reassessment of platforms offshore California. There are two questions about these aged platforms: (1) Are the structures fit-for-purpose? and (2) what types of monitoring and structural reassessment are required?After numerous public workshops, a consensus of what would constitute an acceptable level of fitness-for-purpose was developed. The final document has been approved by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and is now available.In addition to the guidelines, structural inspection and monitoring are an important aspect of maintaining the fitness-for-purpose of these aged structures. Structural inspection intervals are clearly specified in API RP 2A; damaged members can be accurately described in finite element models. So, the analyst can evaluate whether or not repair is mandated by a reduction in structural performance.In addition, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) has instituted a Seafloor Earthquake Measurement System (SEMS) to collect and analyze seismic data offshore. Many recently constructed platforms have accelerometers at various deck levels and having the free-field data available will provide the perfect calibration tool for post-event analyses.In order to verify that offshore operators have performed the reassessment adequately, the State and Federal regulators have instituted methods to check operators. The MMS has developed the Certified Verification Agent (CVA) program wherein a respected peer reviews the structural analysis/retrofit of the aged platform. At the State level, the California State Lands Commission has instituted an in-house review process, wherein the operator submits all structural information, including applied loading, configuration, and computer models, and the work is independently verified.",,,,,California and the World Ocean 97 Conference on Taking a Look at Californias Ocean Resources - An Agenda for the FutureCalifornia and the World Ocean 97 Conference on Taking a Look at Californias Ocean Resources - An Agenda for the Future,"MAR 24-27, 1997MAR 24-27, 1997",,"SAN DIEGO, CASAN DIEGO, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,0-7844-0297-3,,,,,,,,,"Minerals Management Serv, New Orleans, LA 70123 USA",Minerals Management Serv,,,1998-01-01,WOS:000075224700158,,

In the moment of the cap re-motion to perform a routine maintenance five 1 screws failed. The screws worked under cathodic protection, which means that they must have undergone hydrogen pick-up. The investigation showed that the screws had been correctly heat treated by quenching and high temperature tempering, but the sulfur content and the level of inclusions were too high. As a consequence, the screws were highly susceptible to hydrogen induced cracking (HIC). On the other hand, the analysis of the fracture surface revealed that the main cracking mechanism was fatigue. The main recommendation resulted from this work is that the specification for new screws for this kind of service must be more restrictive to sulfur and inclusions contents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Measurement similarity between points typically decays with distance, which is used to set interpolation distances. The importance of analyzing spatiotemporal data at equivalent spatial and temporal scales has been identified but no standard procedure is used to interpolate space using temporally-indexed observations. Using concurrent mobile and stationary active acoustic, fish density data from a tidal energy site in Puget Sound, WA, USA, six methods are compared to estimate the range at which stationary measurements can be spatially interpolated. Four methods estimate the representative range of the mean using autocorrelation or paired t-test and repeated measures ANOVA. Accuracy of resulting sensor density estimates was modeled as departures from interpolated linear and aerial estimates. Two methods were used to estimate representative range of the variance by comparing theoretical spectra or by determining equivalent spatial and temporal scales. Representative ranges of means extended from 30.57 to 403.9 m. Estimation error (i.e., standard deviation) ranges of linearly interpolated or aerially extrapolated values ranged from 42.5 to 82.3%.

The feed stream is considered multi-component, with real chemical species, enabling reliable performance evaluations at different scenarios of pressure, temperature and composition of the gas to be treated by permeation. The resulting differential equations are solved along the characteristic contactor size: (i) steady state mass balances for the species present in each phase (L and V); (ii) momentum balances in each stationary phase; (iii) force balances in each phase. Major simplifications arise from adopting steady state and one-dimensional space over the membrane contactor.The process arrangements are based on recent studies concerning subsalt oil finds in the offshore Santos Basin, Brazil.

This social, technical and environmental complexity and the limits in planning operations strategically during design lead to a high level of uncertainty and limited uncertainty handling. This brings along design changes across the entire lifecycle making upgrades usually very expensive and suboptimal, especially after the deployment of drilling systems. This paper explains the special characteristics of the drilling industry discussing both the reasons for the high level of uncertainty and the passiveness for taking actions.

In this study we follow the evolution of petroleum hydrocarbons, including n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and alkylated PAHs, on a Louisiana beach and salt marsh for three years following the Deepwater Horizon spill. Relative to source oil, we report overall depletion of low molecular weight n-alkanes and PAHs in all locations with time. The magnitude of depletion, however, depends on the sampling location, whereby sites with highest wave energy have highest compound depletion. Oiled sediment from an enclosed bay shows high enrichment of high molecular weight PAHs relative to 17 alpha(H)21 beta(H)-hopane, suggesting the contribution from sources other than the Deepwater Horizon spill, such as fossil fuel burning. This insight into hydrocarbon persistence as a function of hydrography and hydrocarbon source can inform policy and response for future spills. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Tree plantations that replace native forests, cultivated agriculture, or previously cleared land are essentially commodity crops with global market drivers, and do not provide the same ecosystem services as native forests. Nonetheless, they are counted as forest by global programs. We test whether 1) the forest transitions framework (FTF), which typically explains reforestation, adequately describes the socio-economic drivers of plantation establishment and 2) descriptions of the effects of land cover change on ecological processes are obscured when tree plantation and native forest classes are aggregated. We used longitudinal multi-temporal satellite imagery (1985-2001) to map and analyze plantation systems across a 35,853 km(2) area in southern Chile at the plantation frontier. As predicted by the FTF, plantations were established in foothills of predominantly agricultural watersheds rather than in watersheds dominated by native forests or in flat, agriculturally productive areas. Half of the plantations were planted on agricultural or cleared lands that were deforested years ago. Counter to predictions of the FTF, the other half of the plantations replaced native forests. Tree plantations were not associated with rural population loss; instead their establishment was related to the amount of potential usable land. We find that when native forests and tree plantation classes are disaggregated, land in coastal catchments that were converted to tree plantation is related to lower quality nearshore resources; analyses that aggregate plantations with native forests obscure this effect.

However, unlike the bulk of the deep biosphere, the petroleum reservoir deep biosphere is subject to extreme anthropogenic perturbation, with the introduction of new electron acceptors, donors and exogenous microbes during oil exploration and production. Despite the fundamental and practical significance of this perturbation, there has never been a systematic evaluation of the ecological changes that occur over the production lifetime of an active offshore petroleum production system. Analysis of the entire Halfdan oil field in the North Sea (32 producing wells in production for 1-15 years) using quantitative PCR, multigenic sequencing, comparative metagenomic and genomic bins reconstruction revealed systematic shifts in microbial community composition and metabolic potential, as well as changing ecological strategies in response to anthropogenic perturbation of the oil field ecosystem, related to length of time in production. The microbial communities were initially dominated by slow growing anaerobes such as members of the Thermotogales and Clostridiales adapted to living on hydrocarbons and complex refractory organic matter. However, as seawater and nitrate injection (used for secondary oil production) delivered oxidants, the microbial community composition progressively changed to fast growing opportunists such as members of the Deferribacteres, Delta-, Epsilon-and Gammaproteobacteria, with energetically more favorable metabolism (for example, nitrate reduction, H2S, sulfide and sulfur oxidation). This perturbation has profound consequences for understanding the microbial ecology of the system and is of considerable practical importance as it promotes detrimental processes such as reservoir souring and metal corrosion. These findings provide a new conceptual framework for understanding the petroleum reservoir biosphere and have consequences for developing strategies to manage microbiological problems in the oil industry.",,,,,,,,,101,4,1,0,68,0,111,,,1751-7362,1751-7370,,,,,,,,,,"Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, EnglandShell Int Explorat & Prod Inc, Houston, TX USADOE Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA USAShell Global Solut Int BV, Rijswijk, Netherlands",,,,2017-09-01,WOS:000407804100017,28524866,

India has surpassed to Japan and Russia and become the third largest oil consumer in the world. Unfortunately, India's primary energy consumption has increased due to reduced oil and gas production. The increased consumption of imported oil could lead to turbulence in economic growth.

The bioenergy produced from the biomass is being a sustainable alternate energy source which received high acceptance in various sectors include public, industries and government policies. from the Government, public, industries and researches for its sustainability. This review focuson bioprospecting of biomass from terrestrial and marine resources for non conventional energy production and the stepping stones of biofuel for near future. These carbohydrates can be converted into various forms of biofuels either directly or indirectly by exploiting microorganisms. However, the production process and chemical transformation is being an expensive process and therefore commercial supply of biofuel in largescale is not yet successful. Hence an economic and efficient production process is essential to commercialize biomass based biofuels.

Here, we used a combination of metatranscriptomics and genome-resolved metagenomics to study microbial activities in oil-contaminated sediments during oxic-anoxic cycles in laboratory chambers that closely emulated in situ conditions. Approximately 5-fold higher reductions in the total petroleum hydrocarbons were observed in the oxic as compared to the anoxic phases with a relatively constant ratio between aerobic and anaerobic oil decomposition rates even after prolonged anoxic conditions. Metatranscriptomics analysis indicated that the oxic phases promoted oil biodegradation in subsequent anoxic phases by microbially mediated reoxidation of alternative electron acceptors like sulfide and by providing degradation-limiting nitrogen through biological nitrogen fixation. Most population genomes reconstructed from the mesocosm samples represented uncultured taxa and were present typically as members of the rare biosphere in metagenomic data from uncontaminated field samples, implying that the intertidal communities are adapted to changes in redox conditions.

It is generated as a common by-product of many industrial manufacturing processes in: oil and gas exploration and production operations, desulfurization processes in petrochemical industry, sewage and various waste treatment plants, dyes and synthetic petroleum production plants, etc.The U.S Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) for H2S is 10 ppm, which is 30 times lower than the immediately dangerous to life and health level of 300 ppm set by the U.S National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Despite a low human odor threshold for the gas in air(much less than 1ppm), H2S is considered to be an insidious poison because our sense of smell rapidly fatigues, and therefore, fails to provide a good warning of gas concentration.The paper describes the technology of open-path line-of-sight spectral analysis, uniquely developed to detect and distinguish between H2S and petrochemical aromatic gases usually found in the oil and gas industry.The H2S monitoring system analyzes the spectral finger print of the gas in the U.V spectral band and detects the poisonous gas at 5-10 ppm concentration in air over an open path of 50-100 m. The system offers warning and alarm signals set at the above low concentrations, thus providing protection to congested and crowded areas such as offshore and onshore oil and gas exploration and production facilities, where the gas unwanted release may have a fatal impact on the continuous operation of the facility.Several installations of the H2S monitoring system, field and laboratory test data as well as changing environmental condition influences (such as rain, snow and extreme temperatures) are discussed.",,,,,Conference on Advanced Sensors and Monitors for Process Industries and the EnvironmentConference on Advanced Sensors and Monitors for Process Industries and the Environment,"NOV 04-05, 1998NOV 04-05, 1998",SPIE-Int Soc Opt EngnSPIE-Int Soc Opt Engn,"BOSTON, MABOSTON, MA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0277-786X,,0-8194-2996-1,,,,,,,,,"Spectronix Ltd, IL-80150 Sderot, Israel",Spectronix Ltd,,,1999-01-01,WOS:000078906900025,,

Specifically, the operators cost to drill a well can cost tens or hundreds of millions of USD. One specific area where significant changes in drilling operations have occurred is in the offshore environment, specifically operations from mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs). With the ever-increasing demand for oil and gas, operators globally have increased drilling budgets in an effort to meet forecasted demand. However, the increased budgets are often eroded or offset by increasing drilling costs. Therefore, operators are continually in search of new technology, processes, or procedures to help improve drilling operations and overall operational efficiencies.One Latin America operator identified a common operation as a possible area where operational cost could be easily reduced through the implementation of systems that allow the manipulation of valve manifolds remotely. Additionally, operating such valve manifolds remotely enhanced operational safety for personnel, which was an equally important consideration.This paper details the evaluation of existing equipment and procedures and a process used to develop a new remote-control system using a machine logic control (MLC) that has been designed, built, tested, and deployed successfully on MODUs operating in Latin America.",,,,,"33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 08-13, 2014JUN 08-13, 2014","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn Div","San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4537-0,,,,,,,,,"Petrobras SA, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, BrazilHalliburton, Houston, TX USAHalliburton, Oklahoma City, OK USAHalliburton, Macae, RJ, Brazil",,,,2015-12-02,WOS:000363492500010,,

However, CCS is still very much at a developmental stage and the full-scale projects required to test the technology have proven difficult to implement, with lack of societal acceptance considered a key contributing factor to this delay. This paper reports on a study that explored practices for effective communication, engagement strategies and activities in the context of five detailed CCS project case studies. The cases studied included Barendrecht, The Netherlands; Carson, USA; FutureGen, USA; ZeroGen, Australia; and the CO2CRC Otway project, Australia. Comparative analysis of these cases identified a series of factors including: the extent to which key government and project team members are aligned; deployment of communications experts as part of the project team from the outset; consideration of the social context; the degree of flexibility in the project; and competition involving community self-selection. The research team designated these critical success factors that, when present, seemed to enhance the effectiveness of best practices in engagement and contribute to successful project deployment in some cases. The paper proposes that project developers need to consider ways to maximise these critical factors as part of their project planning and implementation process. It also discusses best practices in stakeholder communication and engagement activities applicable to CCS projects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Their development began in the middle of the 20th century, but fully unfolds right now. The construction of the «Eastern Siberia - Pacific Ocean» oil pipeline in 2009 and the «Siberia Power» gas pipeline, which will be put into operation in 2019, close restrictions for the increasing of oil and gas production in Yakutia. A large amount of geological exploration work take place here, aimed to assess the region's resource potential and expanding the volume of hydrocarbon production in the near future. The effectiveness of such work depends critically on the correctness and validity of geological data. The classical point of view that emerged in the time of the oil and gas pioneer researches and still prevail is the idea of the Riphean age of a potentially oil-parent rocks and the presence of a significant stratigraphic gap in the bottom of the productive Vendian-Cambrian strata associated with tectonic events of the Baikal folding. Modern developments in the stratigraphy of Precambrian rocks strata in the adjacent area of the southern periphery of Siberian platform (SP) shows that the entire section of sediments enclosing the oil and gas system should be rejuvenated until the Vendian, and possibly (this must be confirmed or disproved) until the late Vendian (580 Ma) [Rud`ko and others, 2017]. There is reason to believe that the Baikal folding (650-550 Ma) took place before the formation of the Vendian oil and gas bearing rocks. The Ura Uplift (UU), which is located on the most northeastern extremity of the Patom Highland, is the only place where the rocks forming the submerged part of Fore-Patom Regional Depression are accessible for direct geological observations. Their study provides the key to realize the origin and structure of Precambrian-Early Paleozoic sediments in the southern part of the Siberian Platform. Central part of the UU represents by simple undulating anticline. The core of anticline is composed of Dalnaya Taiga Group deposits, which was previously thought to be of Riphean age. The wings are represented by the Vendian-Cambrian deposits of the Zhya and the Trehverstа Groups. These units are confidently compared with the Viluchansky, Nepa, Tira and Danilov oil and gas bearing horizons of the inner part of the SP. A substantiation of a Vendian reference section of Midle Siberia within the UU was carried out by a numerous researchers, among whom the author of the Project belongs [Pokrovsky et al., 2010; 2015; Chumakov and others, 2011; 2013; Sergeev et al., 2011; Leonov, Rud`ko, 2012]. Nevertheless, the study has not been completed, and a number of questions remains unresolved. The main question - to which of the glaciations of the Vendian (Ediacaran) period belongs tillites of the Bolshoy Patom Formation (the Midle Siberian Glacial Horizon) of the Dalnaya Taiga Group at the base of the UU section. Based on the results of bio- and chemostratigraphic studies, they can be attributed either to the Marinoan glaciation (630 Ma) or to the Gaskiers glaciation (580 Ma). The latter option drastically reduces stratigraphic volume of the entire section of the UU [Rud`ko et al. 2017]. Solution of this problem is possible with the help of proposed detailed study of Sr isotope composition and the global chemostratigraphic correlation of the UU deposits. A reference curve of variations in the Sr isotope composition can be created in the UU sectio, this curve will become the basis for the regional chemostratigraphic correlation of oil and gas bearing Precambrian rocks in the inner part of SP. It is also planned to use geochronological Pb-Pb and U-Pb dating methods to clarify the age of the Middle Siberian Glacial Horizon and the onset of formation of Vendian deposits in the region. Another important part of the Project is a sedimentological study of the UU section, which will be performed to clarify depositional environments of Vendian and Early Cambrian strata and to creat a Sequence-Stratigraphic model. Such a model has already been proposed for the Dalnaya Taiga Group of the lower part of UU section [Rud`ko et al., 2017], but the higher stratigraphic levels in the interval of the Zhya and Trehversta Groups [Chumakov et al., 2013] remains insufficiently studied. Sedimentological data will help to clarify the regional distribution of facies (including oil reservoirs and hydrocarbon reservoirs), the periodicity and nature of the sedimentary record gaps on a regional scale. The result of the work on the project will be the new constraints on the age and the depositional environments of UU rocks. This will create prerequisites for revising the geological development of the oil and gas bearing areas of the southern part of the SP. In the future, this will allow a more precise computer modeling of the evolution of oil and gas bearing systems (basin modeling) of the Fore-Patom regional depression and Nepa-Botuoba Anteclise and will enhance the efficiency of oil and gas exploration in southern Siberia.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,18-77-00059,,,,,,,,Institute of Precambrian Geology and Geochronology RAS,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15288054,,

Despite their significance, we lack a basic understanding of the long-term temporal variability of seep dynamics, including bubble size, rise velocity, composition, and upwelling and entrainment processes. The shortcoming makes it difficult to constrain the global estimates of oil and gas entering the marine environment. Here we report on a multi-method approach based on optical, acoustic, satellite remote sensing, and simulations, to connect the characteristics of a hydrocarbon seep in the Gulf of Mexico to its footprint on the sea surface. Using an in-situ camera, bubble dynamics at the source were measured every 6 h over 153 days and the integrated total hydrocarbon release volume was estimated as 53 m(3). The vertical velocity was acoustically measured at 20 m above bed (mab) and found to be approximately 40% less than the dispersed-phase at the source, indicating that the measured values are reflecting the plume continuous-phase flow. Numerical simulations predict that the oily bubbles with diameters larger than 8 mm reach the surface with a small footprint, i.e. forming an oil slick origin, deflection of which with wind and surface current leads to the formation of an oil slick on the surface.

Government programs for the development of Arctic and Far East regions imply a significant increase in the role and number of nuclear power facilities, i.e. potential radiation-hazardous sources such as: naval ships and nuclear submarines; nuclear icebreakers; floating and steady nuclear power plants; nuclear sources for power supply of oil-and-gas production systems and sea- and air-navigation facilities along the Northern Sea Route. Accordingly, an appropriate science-based system of assessing the level of threats and risks at all stages of the development of potential radiation emergencies should be established at such facilities to support decision-making on the elimination or reduction of the level of radiation hazard. So far, there has been no single methodology for Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) in a case of emergency at floating nuclear facilities. The novelty of the challenge consists of the fact that to predict radionuclide spreading in seawater in a case of emergency, two different mathematical models are being developed and sequentially applied: a model of corrosion destruction of nuclear facility safety barriers and radionuclide release beyond their boundaries; and an oceanic transport model for different radionuclides. The above-stated objectives deem achievable due to both the acquired experience of cooperation between three Russian academic institutions: Nuclear Safety Institute (IBRAE), P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanology and G. Marchuk Institute of Numerical Mathematics and some scientific groundwork in this field. Since the establishment of nuclear power more than 30 major accidents have been reported in several countries. In this regard, systematic research is conducted both in our country and abroad. Despite the presence of common causes, each nuclear accident is unique and has many individual features being of great scientific and practical interest. Experience has been gained in the development of a methodology for assessing the radiation and radio-ecological situation as well as radiation risks in a case of nuclear and radiation emergency at transport nuclear-powered installations of naval and icebreaker fleets, as well as of their supporting infrastructure. When designing and building ships, the acquired data are analyzed, and appropriate justification is drawn up for design-basis and beyond-design-basis accidents during their operation, decommissioning, dismantling and disposal. There are also results of investigations related to risk evaluation and safety issues at different stages of nuclear facility life cycle including unloading of nuclear fuel, radwaste management, and situations of planned or emergency dumping of such facilities in the World Ocean. Radionuclide spreading in the ocean is controlled by complex interrelated processes such as: transport by ocean currents, interaction with suspended particles and bottom sediments, and absorption by biota. Active currents, storms and tides may again involve radionuclides from bottom sediments into the marine environment. The method based on the transfer of Lagrange particles receives more and more recognition when modeling the spread of radionuclides in the marine environment. Such an approach enables calculation of the movement and transformation of chemical substances dissolved and suspended in seawater on large time (several years) and spatial (thousands of kilometers) scales. During implementation of the project a computer model for the transport of radionuclides with specified properties (admixture type; half-time, buoyancy, etc.) by sea currents based on the Lagrangian approach will be developed. Computer simulation of radionuclide transport resulting from potential NRHF-related emergencies in the Arctic and Far East seas will be carried out There are presently no accessible international data and common approaches to the problem of degradation of nuclear facility safety barriers. According to our experience, even in the event of planned sea dumping any potentially-hazardous facility may become over time a really-hazardous one due to degradation of its safety barriers, i.e. the time of release of man-made radionuclides out of such facility to seawater will inevitably come. The ability to estimate the rate of radionuclide release to seawater and their spreading area is an important challenge influencing decisions on necessary actions. Thus the development of mathematical models for corrosion degradation of nuclear facility safety barriers and radionuclide transport models in the World Ocean, simulation of these processes for individual representative facilities in seas of the Arctic and Far East, and elaboration of EIA procedure for emergency situations at floating nuclear facilities are rather important and topical tasks.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,17-19-01674,,,,,,,,Nuclear Safety Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences (IBRAE RAN),,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15291756,,

Improving the service quality and customer satisfaction of outsourced IT service is the main rationale behind pursuing this research.Design/methodology/approach - Three firms were selected for studying primarily because a large part of their IT support work is outsourced to multiple vendors and support work is carried out, both on site and offshore. A structured, open-ended interview was conducted because of the exploratory nature of this case study. The primary data were collected through face-to-face interviews, with 12 senior managers. Extensive secondary data were provided by the interviewees.Findings - The paper provides evidence that by following critical success factors there are few expected outcomes to client and service provider organizations, like user satisfaction for the client, and competitive advantage and customer retention in IT service-providing organizations. As evident from the interview with the three companies, from their experience over the years of outsourcing the IT services, the service providers are able to sustain better employee retention. Customers have seen improved employee attitude and morale, increased productivity of the service provider, which resulted in reduced costs to customers over the years.Research limitations/implications - The findings were based solely on oil and gas organizations from North America and UK. Also, service providers for these organizations have the majority of their operations out of India, and again, the feedback from the customers may be focused only on these service providers, and may not reflect service practices in other geographic, economic or cultural settings. The implication of this research on theory is, by following these critical success factors, user customer satisfaction is likely to improve with outsourced IT services.Practical implications - This research may help in reducing service provider burn-out and improve employee retention. Lessons learned are that to be a successful IT service provider in a long-run, one needs to understand the end user and executives of client, and also its own knowledge workers. Also, the findings may provide valuable insights for practitioners.Originality/value - IT outsourcing is ultimately a people-centric business. Many client and service provider companies make the error of assuming that it's a process-centric event, or a simple business transaction. The best outsource service providers focus on morale, resistance, retention, and cultural evolution. Implementing effective service management will pay back in terms of better service and improved business performance, and result in stronger long-term relationships between suppliers and recipients.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,0,23,,,1741-0398,1758-7409,,,,,,,,,,"SAIC India, Serv Delivery, Bangalore, Karnataka, IndiaVIT Univ, VIT Business Sch, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India",SAIC India,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000212897200002,,

Reel-lay is a widely used method to install clad pipes. During the installation and service process, engineering critical assessment (ECA) is usually required to guarantee safety. Most of the ECA methods pertain to surface cracks. The DNV-RP-F108 standard indicates that an embedded crack can be transformed into a surface crack in evaluation, and the result is still conservative. However, the evaluation can be over-conservative at times, meanwhile, the effect of the weld material as well as groove shape is not considered. In this work, a more direct assessment of welded clad pipes with a circumferential embedded crack is proposed based on a modified reference strain approach. A strain-controlled boundary condition is applied, and various pipe and weld geometrical shapes are considered in the analysis matrix. Two plugins based on Python script are developed to circularly create a lot of numerical models. Hundreds of regression analyses based on the linear relationship between normalized J integral and nominal strain are implemented.

Previous LCA studies of marine fuels rely on general LCA models such as GREET and JEC well-to-wheels study. These models do not fully capture the various methane losses in the fuel supply chain. The primary goal of this LCA study is to compare the GHG emissions of heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil produced from Saudi crude oil to liquefied natural gas (LNG) in different global regions. A sensitivity analysis was performed to show how results may vary with non-Saudi crudes. A secondary goal was to advance LCA of marine fuels by utilizing, for the first time, a set of bottom-up engineering models that enable detailed analysis of specific oil and gas projects worldwide. The results show particular cases where LNG use in marine applications has a significant countereffect in terms of climate change compared to conventional marine fuels produced from a low-carbon-intensity crude oil.

Restoring and reforesting such riparian zones to mature forest, particularly along headwater streams (which constitute 90% of stream network length) would both increase carbon storage and improve water quality. Age and management-related cover/condition classes of headwater stream networks can be used to rapidly inventory carbon storage and sequestration potential if carbon storage capacity of conditions classes and their relative distribution on the landscape are known.RESULTS: Based on the distribution of riparian zone cover/condition classes in sampled headwater reaches, current and potential carbon storage was extrapolated to the remainder of the North Carolina Coastal Plain stream network. Carbon stored in headwater riparian reaches is only about 40% of its potential capacity, based on 242 MgC/ha stored in sampled mature riparian forest (forest > 50 y old). The carbon deficit along 57,700 km headwater Coastal Plain streams is equivalent to about 25TgC in 30-m-wide riparian buffer zones and 50 TgC in 60-m-wide buffer zones.CONCLUSIONS: Estimating carbon storage in recognizable age-and cover-related condition classes provides a rapid way to better inventory current carbon storage, estimate storage capacity, and calculate the potential for additional storage. In light of the particular importance of buffer zones in headwater reaches in agricultural landscapes in ameliorating nutrient and sediment input to streams, encouraging the restoration of riparian zones to mature forest along headwater reaches worldwide has the potential to not only improve water quality, but also simultaneously reduce atmospheric CO2.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,13,0,24,,,,1750-0680,,,,,,,,,,"Department of Biology, East Carolina University, Mail Stop 551, Greenville, North Carolina, 27858, USA. rheinhardtr@ecu.edu.",,,,2012-01-01,MEDLINE:22333213,22333213,

There are vast depositions of methane hydrates on the sea floor and under permafrost. The methane hydrates are stable under high pressure and low temperature conditions. Depressurization method is being developed for methane gas production from deep sea methane hydrate layers. In this method, the methane hydrates are depressurized by a pump, and dissociated to be methane gas and water. There is a risk of plugging in the production well by reformed methane hydrates such as at stagnation points and during an operation stop. To manage the plugging risk, inhibitors for methane hydrate formation are necessary. Among several chemical inhibitors, thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors (THIS) are a unique technique that can dissociate methane hydrates. Ammonium salts are one of THIs which naturally occur in oceans and vastly available in the deep sea area. In this study, inhibition effects of ammonium chloride on gas hydrates of methane, carbon dioxide and ethane are investigated. Three phase (gas hydrate aqueous) equilibrium conditions are measured by a temperature search method. The equilibrium data show that ammonium chloride suppresses equilibrium temperatures of these gas hydrates until it reaches solubility limit in water. The comparison with molecular inhibitors showed that ammonium chloride inhibits methane hydrate formation more than urea, but less than methanol. The present data clarified the inhibition effect of ammonium chloride on subsea natural gas hydrates and CO2 injection and sequestration techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Significant induction of filamental chloride cells (CCs) (increases in CC density, apical opening area, fractional area, volume densities of CCs, and mitochondria within CCs), concomitant with a significant reduction in blood osmolality, was found within 3 h of exposure to C. marina. Further reduction in blood osmolality (67%) and a drastic decline of pO(2) (70%) were detected in moribund fish after 6 h. Fish were also subjected to severe salinity stress (abrupt transfer to 0 and 60% salinities), and the same parameters were measured. Our quantitative ultrastructural and physiological data suggest that fish exposed for 6 h to C. marina (2,000 cells/ml) suffered similar but more severe osmotic distress as compared to that induced by abrupt transfer to 60% hypersaline water. Results of the salinity stress experiment also showed that suffocation was not a secondary response induced by osmotic impairment in the moribund fish.

Thus, the largest global vegetable oil spillage in a freshwater wetland, which occurred at the Con Joubert Bird Sanctuary wetland in 2007, presented an ideal opportunity to evaluate these impacts. Five post-spill sampling sites were selected within the wetland from which a variety of abiotic and biotic samples were collected bimonthly over a period of 12 months. Abiotic variables included the sediment and water column oil concentrations, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), silica, chlorophyll a, as well as in situ measurements of pH, electrical conductivity, and dissolved oxygen. Aquatic macroinvertebrates were chosen as biotic indicators in the study field due to their wide applicability as water quality indicators and were thus collected at each site. Spatial and temporal changes in total nitrogen, total phosphorous, and chlorophyll a concentrations as well as changes in pH were observed. The oil spillage also resulted in an increase in tolerant macroinvertebrate taxa, mainly Chironomidae and Psychodidae, at the sites closest to the source of the spillage. These two taxa, and to a lesser extent, Syrphidae, were identified as potentially useful indicators to determine the extent of vegetable oil contamination within a freshwater wetland. Furthermore, monitoring of these indicator taxa can be a useful management tool to determine the recovery of freshwater wetlands after vegetable oil spills. In the study, a static battery of bioassays of different biotic trophic levels was also employed to determine the adverse effects of the spilled vegetable oil on the biotic environment. It was evident from the result of the static battery of bioassay that adverse effects of the sunflower oil differ between trophic levels.

Results show that the EAND performs good balance between local and global searches, providing the best results in 17 out of the 20 optimization problems, and achieving the fastest convergence in 16 simulated problems. The proposed algorithm yielded the best soft sensors under the five offshore oil wells studied when compared to other identification methods. Three kinds of nonlinear models for prediction were implemented, and ensembles composed of decision trees (Random Forest) obtained the best results. The Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) found when predicting the downhole pressure by the identified soft sensors ranged from 0.1453% to 0.788%, which are very satisfactory.

As a consequence of their direct exposure to seawater, subsea wet insulation systems on subsea trees, manifolds, and jumpers are amongst the most affected by this progression. Due to the significant thermal gradient between the production stream and subsea environment, subsea insulation systems are constantly trying to inhibit the natural heat transfer. In an effort preserve the operational integrity of the production system, the subsea insulation system maintains the production stream temperature above the hydrate formation and wax deposition temperatures. Thus, any failures such as cracks, disbondment, or hydrolysis, substantially influence the subsea system's operational philosophy. As a result of Exxon Mobil's observed performance challenges with wet insulation systems, a thorough qualification program was initiated in 2007 to validate the performance of a wet insulation system under simulated service conditions. The qualification consisted of 3 test phases, including basic material property tests, simulated service tests, and an extended service test, for multiple insulation systems.

Therefore, the microbial communities from three anaerobic biofilms recovered from the inside of a steel pipe exhibiting high corrosion rates, iron oxide deposits, and substantial amounts of sulfur, which are characteristic of MIC, were analyzed in detail. Bacterial and archaeal community structures were investigated by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, multigenic (16S rRNA and functional genes) high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing, and quantitative PCR analysis. The microbial community analysis indicated that bacteria, particularly Desulfovibrio species, dominated the biofilm microbial communities. However, other bacteria, such as Pelobacter, Pseudomonas, and Geotoga, as well as various methanogenic archaea, previously detected in oil facilities were also detected. The microbial taxa and functional genes identified suggested that the biofilm communities harbored the potential for a number of different but complementary metabolic processes and that MIC in oil facilities likely involves a range of microbial metabolisms such as sulfate, iron, and elemental sulfur reduction.

This study was undertaken to address a curious ecological phenomenon that occurs over extensive areas of northern Vancouver Island, Canada. Slow tree growth and symptoms of nutrient deficiencies appear within 10 years of harvesting old-growth cedar-hemlock (CH) forests, but do not occur on adjacent hemlock-fir (HA) stands. We investigate the underlying causes of distinct differences in productivity and fertility of the two ecosystems.2. We hypothesized that the differences in nutrient supply and tree growth arise from small, but ecologically significant, differences in soil moisture with attendant effects on redox potential (Eh), aeration, soil C stores and plant species distribution. Our field studies determined (i) whether neighbouring CH and HA forests differ in soil moisture and aeration, (ii) whether soil carbon stores differ among CH and HA forests, (iii) whether plant community composition in the two forest types is related to soil moisture and aeration and (iv) the impact of harvesting CH and HA forests on moisture and aeration conditions.3. As hypothesized, soils in CH forests were wetter and less aerated, and had shallower aerated depth and higher frequency of anaerobic conditions compared with HA forests. About 43% of the samples taken from CH forests had average redox values < + 300 mV, a threshold below which anaerobic conditions develop and root growth is impeded. Soil carbon stores and rates of decomposition of cellulose did not differ among the forest types. Soil aeration explained 25% of the variability in species composition of plant communities.4. The two forest types responded differently to clear-cut harvesting, and there were indications that clear-cut harvesting could trigger reductions in soil aeration in some HA forest soils which could lead to paludification and a decline in site productivity of these ecosystems.5. Synthesis. Our findings confirmed that these ecosystems bracket a critical biological threshold below which low soil oxygen availability caused by excessive moisture becomes limiting for biological processes. Recognition of this redox threshold and its ecological implications could contribute to improved ability to manage ecosystems which may be near this threshold or become so in a changing climate.",,,,,,,,,35,2,0,0,27,0,39,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, CanadaUniv British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",,,,2012-05-02,WOS:000302623200004,,

Fiber optic sensors are attractive in deepwater applications because of their multiplexing capability, immunity to electro-magnetic interference, ruggedness and long distance signal transmission ability. Design maturity of a complete fiber optic sensor system has been achieved through full scale riser deployment in actual deepwater fields.Two major areas of concern exist for deepwater riser structural integrity. The first concern involves high mechanical loads in the touch down area where the riser sits on the ocean floor and transitions from horizontal to vertical leading to topside. Secondly, vortex induced vibration that is caused primarily by high rate ocean currents. Both areas are susceptible to rapid fatigue failure.",,,,,,,,,4,1,0,0,0,0,5,,,0091-1062,,,,,,,,,,,"Astro Technol Inc, Houston, TX USA",Astro Technol Inc,,,2005-09-01,WOS:000231937700003,,

A model is deduced to calculate the excess pore fluid pressure. In addition, a new method is proposed to define and calculate the factor of safety (FoS) of the submarine slope. Case study is also performed, results of which show that dissociation of hydrates would decrease the stability of submarine slope. If the cohesion of the hydrate-bearing sediments is small, the submarine slope would become unstable because of the shear failure. If the cohesion of the hydrate-bearing sediments is large enough, the tensile failure would happen in the hydrate-bearing sediments and the excess pore pressure may explode the submarine slope. Under the drained condition, the submarine slope may remain stable because the buildup of excess pore fluid pressure could not take place. Moreover, FoS would be underestimated by the assumption that natural gas hydrates dissociate in the horizontally confined space, but would be overestimated by only taking into account of the base of the natural gas hydrate-bearing sediments. The compressibility factor of natural gas should also be considered because treating natural gas as ideal gas would underestimate the stability of submarine slope.",,,,,,,,,29,4,0,0,4,0,33,,,1064-119X,1521-0618,,,,,,,,,,"Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",,,,2019-07-02,WOS:000472102500006,,

The floating structures are moored amongst themselves and floating in close proximity. The objective is to investigate the first order relative motions of side-by-side moored floating structures and the loads on the mooring lines and fenders, and to validate the existing numerical method by comparing to experimental results. Two case studies are analyzed. The first consists of two similar tankers moored together in intermediate water depth (80 m). The second configuration considers a floating production storage and offloading system for production of LNG (FLNG), with a side moored shuttle tanker. The experimental work was carried out in two offshore wave basins with scaled models subjected to irregular operational seastates. The measured responses include the motions of the two floating structures and the loads in the mooring lines connecting them.

Here we assess the biodegradation potential of marine microorganisms from three water depths in the Campos Basin (South Atlantic Ocean): (i) 5 m (surface), (ii) similar to 80 m (chlorophyll maximum layer), and (iii) similar to 1200 m (near the bottom). After incubating seawater samples with or without crude oil for 52 days, we used metagenomics and classic microbiology techniques to analyze microbial abundance and diversity, and measured physical-chemical parameters to better understand biodegradation processes. We observed increased microbial abundance and concomitant decreases in dissolved oxygen and hydrocarbon concentrations, indicating oil biodegradation in the three water depths treatments within approximately 27 days. An increase in metagenomic sequences of oil-degrading archaea, fungi, and bacteria (Alcanivorax, Alteromonas, Colwellia, Marinobacter, and Pseudomonas) accompanied by a significant increase in metagenomic sequences involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds indicate that crude oil promotes the growth of microorganisms with oil degradation potential. The abundance of genes involved in biodegrading benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, alkanes, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons peaked approximately 3 days after oil addition. All 12 novel metagenome-assembled genomes contained genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation, indicating the oil-degrading potential of planktonic microbes in the Campos Basin.

Floating Production Storage and Offloading platforms are preferred in such frontier offshore enterprises. However, ultra-deepwaters natural gas processing imposes challenges in the design of floating units, limited in area and weight of processing equipment. Oil reserves with high gas/oil ratio (>250 sm3/m3) and high carbon dioxide content create additional challenges due to the impacts in the deck area of the gas plant. Among other natural gas processing operations, removal of carbon dioxide is required to meet sales gas specification, being skid-mounted membrane modules well suited for this purpose. To avoid emissions and to increase oil production, the separated acid gas is injected for enhanced oil recovery, creating a changing scenario due to increasing carbon dioxide content in the reservoir along production lifetime. In this context, this work optimizes arrangements of membranes modules and operational conditions via nonlinear programming formulations to optimize total membrane area for minimum footprint of membrane skids, with either carbon dioxide content in the treated natural gas less than 3% mol (Type 1 Constraint) or methane losses in the injection gas limited by imposing carbon dioxide content in the injection gas greater than 75%mol (Type 2 Constraint). To reduce computational effort, surface response models are employed, regressed from data simulated with a rigorous phenomenological model of spiral-wound membrane modules. Optimization results total and stage area, carbon dioxide contents in retentates and permeates and natural gas production are obtained for three feed scenarios: 10%mol, 30%mol and 50%mol carbon dioxide in raw natural gas. Type 1 Constraint leads to higher methane losses while Type 2 Constraint demands a polishing Chemical Absorption to comply with carbon dioxide specification of sales gas, configuring a hybrid process. Life cycle costs and total footprint area point to superiority of carbon dioxide separation design resulting from Type 2 Constraint, with optimal service distribution between bulk removal in Membrane Permeation and polishing operation in Chemical Absorption, considering time-varying composition of the raw natural gas.

Though it is well understood that environmental perturbations like oil pollution can alter the diversity and composition of microbiomes, remarkably little is known about how disturbance alters plant-fungal associations. Using Next-Generation sequencing of the 18S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) region, we examined outcomes of enduring oil exposure on aboveground leaf and belowground endophytic root and rhizosphere fungal communities of Spartina alterniflora, a highly valued ecosystem engineer in southeastern Louisiana marshes affected by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident. We found that aboveground foliar fungal communities exhibited site-dependent compositional turnover with consequent loss in diversity according to oiling history. Rhizosphere soil communities also exhibited shifts in community composition associated with oiling history, whereas root endophytic communities did not. Oiling did not increase or decrease similarities among aboveground and belowground communities within an individual host, indicating that host plant characteristics exert stronger control than external factors on fungal community composition. These results show that fungal community responses to oiling vary within tissues of the same host plant, and that differences in the local environment, or alternatively, site-specific differences in residual oil constrain the magnitude of exposure responses. Our study offers novel perspectives on how environmental contaminants and perturbations can influence plant microbiomes, highlighting the importance of assessing long-term ecological outcomes of oil pollution to better understand how shifts in microbial communities influence plant performance and ecosystem function. Our findings are relevant to coastal management programs tasked with responding to oil spills and increasing pressures arising from intensifying development and climate change. Understanding how modification of plant-micobiorme associations influences plant performance, particularly of ecosystem engineers like S. alterniflora, can help guide efforts to protect and restore at-risk coastal ecosystems.

Special attention is paid to the methods of quantification of risks of the Arctic projects, i.e. those risks which have no definite value or quantitative expression and must be estimated using verbal and mathematical transformations. Regarding quantification of risks of the Arctic projects related to the extraction of hydrocarbon resources, the article proposes a methodology based on integration of financial, econometric, and economic methods which allows to convert original information into a comparable magnitude. Testing methods using the example of two Arctic projects have shown that risks in these projects are above average. This, in turn, may affect the environment and economic efficiency of the hydrocarbon production in the Arctic. The methodical approach proposed by the authors gives an adaptive tool that can also be used in order to analyze and measure the risk of other capital investment projects in the energy sector. As a key conclusion, the authors specify that the quantification of the risks, as well as publication of the data on the level of risks of the Arctic projects, will undoubtedly contribute to improving transparency of the activities of international and Russian oil and gas corporations. In turn, this will ensure growth of social and environmental responsibility of corporate structures which suggests that exploration, as well as work related to the production of hydrocarbon resources in the Arctic, will meet modern scientific and management paradigm (socialization, greening activities providing sustainable development of corporate and business structures).",,,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,2,,,1994-5124,2411-2658,,,,,,,,,,"Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, 82 Vernadskogo Prosp, Moscow 119571, RussiaRussian Acad Sci, Market Econ Inst, 47 Nakhi Movsky Prosp, Moscow 117418, Russia",,,,2018-01-05,WOS:000418572100007,,

Our resulting probabilistic range of the gas hydrate-bound natural gas in the northern Gulf of Mexico ranges from 37 TCM (10th percentile estimate) to 78 TCM (90th percentile estimate) of gas hydrate-bound natural gas, with a mean estimate of 56TCM.

The AHs were related to the presence of biogenic organic matter and degraded oil residues. The PAHs were associated with mixed sources. The highest hydrocarbon concentrations were related to oil spills, while relatively low levels could be attributed to the decrease in oil usage during the global oil crisis. The results of electron paramagnetic resonance were in agreement with the absolute AHs and PAHs concentrations measured by chromatographic techniques, while near-infrared spectroscopy results were consistent with unresolved complex mixture (UCM)/total n-alkanes ratios.

The amount of natural gas stored as hydrates in permafrost and ocean sediments is twice that of all other fossil fuels combined. However, hydrate blockages also hinder oil/gas pipeline transportation, and, despite their huge potential as energy sources, our insufficient understanding of hydrates has limited their extraction. Here, we report how the presence of amino acids in water induces changes in its structure and thus interrupts the formation of methane and natural gas hydrates. The perturbation of the structure of water by amino acids and the resulting selective inhibition of hydrate cage formation were observed directly. A strong correlation was found between the inhibition efficiencies of amino acids and their physicochemical properties, which demonstrates the importance of their direct interactions with water and the resulting dissolution environment. The inhibition of methane and natural gas hydrate formation by amino acids has the potential to be highly beneficial in practical applications such as hydrate exploitation, oil/gas transportation, and flow assurance. Further, the interactions between amino acids and water are essential to the equilibria and dynamics of many physical, chemical, biological, and environmental processes.",,,,,,,,,130,8,0,0,15,0,137,,,2045-2322,,,,,,,,,,,"Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem Engn, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 790784, Gyeongbuk, South KoreaRes Inst Ind Sci & Technol, Project Team CO2, 67 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 790600, Gyeongbuk, South KoreaPohang Accelerator Lab, Beamline Div, 80 Jigok Ro 127Beon Gil, Pohang 790834, Gyeongbuk, South KoreaKorea Inst Ind Technol, Offshore Plant Resources R&D Ctr, 30 Gwahaksandan 1 Ro 60Beon Gil, Busan 618230, South KoreaColorado Sch Mines, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Res Inst Ind Sci & Technol,,,2017-02-08,WOS:000392126100001,27526869,

After WW2 over 32,000 tons of chemical weapons were dumped in this area. The aim of the investigations was to image the internal structure of the dumpsite and to identify possible natural hazards with regard to the dumped war material. Two geophysical surveys were carried out in the summers of 2006 and 2007. During the surveys, acoustic sources with a distinct frequency spectrum (parametric echosounder, sparker, boomer) were deployed simultaneously. This approach proved very fruitful as it allowed to study the sediments in a wide depth range and in the highest possible detail. In total, seven seismic-stratigraphic units have been identified, related to different stages in the Holocene and late glacial history. Water depths range roughly between 96 m in the north and 70 m in the south where the basin shallows and older glacial sediments are outcropping. The seafloor topography at the dumpsite is generally quite flat, locally marked by small pit-like features that are probably related to the dumping impact. Small-scale fluid escape features are present throughout the dumpsite area. Large-scale doming occurs locally and is possibly linked to the migration of deep thermogenic gas. A large number of buried objects were identified on the acoustic data. Their burial depth is generally less than 1 m. The data confirm the wide variety of dumped war material, ranging from bombs and shells to encasements and containers. The distribution of the objects seems to be very heterogeneous, with locally high concentrations and areas of low object density. Four different shipwrecks were identified but their relation to the dumped warfare is not clear.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1866-6280,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Ghent, Dept Geol & Soil Sci, Renard Ctr Marine Geol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",,,,2010-03-01,WOS:000274385200008,,

The OIM is responsible for the safety and well-being of all persons on-board and within 500 m of the installation whilst operating within a complex environment where multiple organisations and stakeholders interact. The persistence of major incidents in the industry highlights the importance of OIM competence in controlling emergencies, consequently the research aims to identify the potential barriers that can limit or prevent the proficient competence assessment of an OIM in this situation. The OIM role is investigated by qualitative analysis of key documents using hermeneutics to interpret text and to identify the potential barriers to effective competence assessment. Such analysis has historically been used within the domains of theology, business and law. Hermeneutics takes into account the cultural, historical and social environment at the time of issue of the document, and semiotics, i.e. the study of signs and symbols, their use and interpretation.Analysis is ongoing, however the six potential barriers to the effective competence assessment of OIMs in controlling emergencies identified to date are discussed. These barriers are associated with the multiple definitions of competence that exist in the UK and worldwide; the current predominance of competence assessment by observation; the lack of definitive competence requirements for trainers and assessors; the complexity in UK legislation and the interaction between UK Government departments and concerns associated with goal setting legislation when applied to competence assessment.The output from the research will assist industry Duty Holders improve the competence assessment of their appointed OlMs and allow safety engineers to consider the probable competence of an OIM in a given environment at a given point in time.

The region supports a wide range of land-use activities as well as attractions such as nature consenation areas. One environmental aspect that has not previously been addressed in this area is the occurrence of minor and trace metals in estuarine sediments associated with the main estuaries of the region. The trace metals included in this investigation are: vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead and arsenic. To determine and evaluate the occurrence and distribution of metals in the area, several components have been analysed: bedrock material, pre-industrial settings, recent estuarine sediments, soils of estuarine origin and mangrove pneumatophores. The 40 sites chosen for sediment and soil samples cover a variety of estuarine settings and represent a range of natural conditions in terms of channel and bank morphology, tidal energy, vegetation cover, relationship to bedrock, water salinity, and land disturbance.The chemical, mineralogical and statistical analyses employed in this study enabled (a) establishment of background values for the area, (b) determination of relationships between metals and (c) identification of sites with anomalous metal concentrations.All the metals found in the sediments of the area are sourced from the geological bedrock. The dominant trace elements identified in sediments are Zn, V and Cr. The remaining metals are highly variable spatially. All trace metals are controlled by the presence of Fe and Mn oxides, and by the grainsize of the sediment, Typically, fine-grained Fe-rich materials tend to adsorb more trace metals than sandy sediments. In soils that have developed from estuarine muds, some metals such as Cr, Mo, Pb and As tend to be in larger quantities than in the estuarine counterparts.Some of the elements, which occur in significant amounts in the sediment, have been detected in mangrove tissue (Avicennia marina) such as V, Cr, Zn, Fe and Mn. Of particular note is Cu, which is present in mangrove tissue in quantities many times exceeding the sediment concentration,The comparative analysis of pre-industrial settings and recent sediments and soils highlighted some areas of metal enrichment such as acid-affected sites where oxidation of pyrite has mobilised metals from sediments; these metals are then redistributed in Fe-rich surficial layers. Disturbed banks within the estuaries are also likely to have low levels of metal enrichment due to boating activities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The virus occurs as low- and high virulent variants where the former seem to be a continuous source of new high virulent ISAV. The latter are controlled in Norway by stamping out infected populations while the former are spreading uncontrolled among farmed salmon. Evidence of vertical transmission has been presented, but there is still an ongoing discussion of the importance of circulation of ISAV via salmon brood fish. The only known wild reservoirs are in trout (Salmo trutta) and salmon (Salmo salar). This study provides the first ISAV sequences from wild salmonids in Norway and evaluates the importance of this reservoir with respect to outbreaks of ISA among farmed salmon. Phylogenetic analyses of the surface protein hemagglutinin-esterase gene from nearly all available ISAV from Norway, Faeroe Islands, Scotland, Chile and wild salmonids in Norway show that they group into four major clades. Including virulent variants in the analysis show that they belong in the same four clades supporting the hypothesis that there is a high frequency of transition from low to high virulent variants in farmed populations of salmon. There is little support for a hypothesis suggesting that the wild salmonids feed the virus into farmed populations. This study give support to earlier studies that have documented local horizontal transmission of high virulent ISAV, but the importance of transition from low- to high virulent variants has been underestimated. Evidence of vertical transmission and long distance spreading of ISAV via movement of embryos and smolt is presented. We recommend that the industry focus on removing the low virulent ISAV from the brood fish and that ISAV-free brood fish salmon are kept in closed containment systems (CCS).",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,9,0,13,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bergen, Fish Dis Res Grp, Bergen, NorwayPHARMAQ AS, Oslo, Norway",PHARMAQ AS,,,2019-05-01,WOS:000464696100050,30990853,

Yet, few field data are available on the long-term fate and persistency of sediment-retained oil. While an unprecedented amount of oil dispersants was applied, the effects of oil dispersants on desorption of field aged oil remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the abundance, distributions and physico-chemical availability of the oil retained in Bay Jimmy sediment, Louisiana, five years after the DwH oil spill, and to determine the effects of two model oil dispersants on the desorption potential of the residual oil. Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs), n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the sediment were analyzed and compared with those in the crude oil and the pre-DwH levels, and batch desorption kinetic tests were carried out to quantify the dispersant effects on the desorption rate and extent. The biomarker hopanes profile and diagnostic ratio were analyzed, which confirmed the origin and persistence of the sediment-retained oil. After five-year natural weathering, the oil level in the sediment remained orders of magnitude higher than the pre-spill level. Nearly all low-molecular-weight n-alkanes and 2-ring PAHs had been degraded. Oil dispersants, SPC 1000 and Corexit EC9500A, were able to enhance solubilization of the sediment-retained oil upon resuspension of the sediment. Successive desorption experiments indicated that 71.6% of TPHs, 74.8% of n-alkanes, and 91.9% of PAHs in the sediment remained highly stable and hardly desorbable by seawater; yet, addition of 18 mg/L of SPC 1000 enhanced the desorption and lowered these fractions to 57.3%, 68.1%, and 81.4%, respectively. The findings are important for understanding the natural weathering rate and persistence of oil residual and the effects of dispersants on the physical and biological availabilities of aged oil in coastal sediments.

Once oil reached the surface, changes in overall chemical composition occurred due to volatilization of the smaller carbon chain compounds as the oil was transported onshore by winds and currents. In this study, the toxic effects of both fresh and weathered crude oil on denitrification rates of coastal marsh soil were determined using soil samples collected from an unimpacted coastal marsh site proximal to areas that were oiled in Barataria Bay, LA. The 1:10 ratio of crude oil:field moist soil fully coated the soil surface mimicking a heavy oiling scenario. Potential denitrification rates at the 1:10 ratio, for weathered crude oil, were 46 +/- 18.4% of the control immediately after exposure and 62 +/- 8.0% of the control following a two week incubation period, suggesting some adaptation of the denitrifying microbial consortium over time. Denitrification rates of soil exposed to fresh crude oil were 51.5 +/- 5.3% of the control after immediate exposure and significantly lower at 10.9 +/- 1.1% after a 2 week exposure period. Results suggest that fresh crude oil has the potential to more severely impact the important marsh soil process of denitrification following longer term exposure. Future studies should focus on longer-term denitrification as well as changes in the microbial consortia in response to oil exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The CVAR is a new riser concept that can improve the structural performance of the production system and also provide several operational benefits. The DOE is a statistical technique that provides an objective measure of how design parameters are correlated and the effective contribution of each one at the riser performance. Based on such a study some general conclusive remarks on the global behavior of CVAR will be presented. Such results also play an important role for the optimization process, as it can highlight significant design parameters, enabling design simplifications and efficiency improvement. For optimization assessment, geometric parameters are taken as the design variables and the design constraints consider both structural integrity and operational criteria. A multi-objective approach is considered taking into account the structural performance and geometric criteria. Optimal solution is obtained by NSGA-II method. Extreme and operational environmental conditions of a Brazilian offshore field are used as the base case.

Copiotrophic Alteromonas are marine gammaproteobacteria that thrive during the late stages of phytoplankton blooms in the marine environment and in laboratory co-cultures with cyanobacteria such as Trichodesmium. The response of this heterotroph to the sometimes rapid and transient changes in nutrient supply when the phototroph crashes is not well understood. Here, we isolated and sequenced the strain Alteromonas macleodii str. Te101 from a laboratory culture of Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101, yielding a chromosome of 4.63 Mb and a single plasmid of 237 kb. Increasing salinities to >= 43 ppt inhibited the growth of Trichodesmium but stimulated growth of the associated Alteromonas. We characterized the transcriptomic responses of both microorganisms and identified the complement of active transcriptional start sites in Alteromonas at single-nucleotide resolution. In replicate cultures, a similar set of genes became activated in Alteromonas when growth rates of Trichodesmium declined and mortality was high. The parallel activation of fliA, rpoS and of flagellar assembly and growth-related genes indicated that Alteromonas might have increased cell motility, growth, and multiple biosynthetic activities. Genes with the highest expression in the data set were three small RNAs (Aln1a-c) that were identified as analogs of the small RNAs CsrB-C in E. coli or RsmX-Z in pathogenic bacteria. Together with the carbon storage protein A (CsrA) homolog Te101_05290, these RNAs likely control the expression of numerous genes in responding to changes in the environment.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,19,0,25,,,1751-7362,1751-7370,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Schanzlestr 1, D-79104 Freiburg, GermanyUniv Miguel Hernandez, Div Microbiol, Evolutionary Genom Grp, Apartado 18, Alicante 03550, SpainBar Ilan Univ, Mina & Everard Goodman Fac Life Sci, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, IsraelMax Planck Genome Ctr Cologne, Carl von Linne Weg 10, D-50829 Cologne, GermanyUniv Freiburg, Freiburg Inst Adv Studies, Albertstr 19, D-79104 Freiburg, GermanySwiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",,,,2018-04-01,WOS:000427917700005,29335641,

It is a mixture of different organic and inorganic compounds. Due to the increasing volume of waste all over the world in the current decade, the outcome and effect of discharging produced water on the environment has lately become a significant issue of environmental concern. Produced water is conventionally treated through different physical, chemical, and biological methods. In offshore platforms because of space constraints, compact physical and chemical systems are used. However, current technologies cannot remove small-suspended oil particles and dissolved elements. Besides, many chemical treatments, whose initial and/or running cost are high and produce hazardous sludge. In onshore facilities, biological pretreatment of oily wastewater can be a cost-effective and environmental friendly method. As high salt concentration and variations of influent characteristics have direct influence on the turbidity of the effluent, it is appropriate to incorporate a physical treatment, e.g., membrane to refine the final effluent. For these reasons, major research efforts in the future could focus on the optimization of current technologies and use of combined physico-chemical and/or biological treatment of produced water in order to comply with reuse and discharge limits.

Gas hydrate reservoirs are similar to a storage cupboard in the global carbon cycle, containing most of the world's methane and accounting for a third of Earth's mobile organic carbon. We investigated gas hydrate stability zone burial depths from the viewpoint of conditions associated with stable existence of gas hydrates, such as temperature, pressure, and heat flow, based on related data collected by the global drilling programs. Hydrate-related areas are estimated using various biological, geochemical and geophysical tools. Based on a series of previous investigations, we cover the history and status of gas hydrate exploration in the USA, Japan, South Korea, India, Germany, the polar areas, and China. Then, we review the current techniques for hydrate exploration in a global scale. Additionally, we briefly review existing techniques for recovering methane from gas hydrates, including thermal stimulation, depressurization, chemical injection, and CH4-CO2 exchange, as well as corresponding global field trials in Russia, Japan, United States, Canada and China. In particular, unlike diagenetic gas hydrates in coarse sandy sediments in Japan and gravel sediments in the United States and Canada, most gas hydrates in the northern South China Sea are non-diagenetic and exist in fine-grained sediments with a vein-like morphology. Therefore, especially in terms of the offshore production test in gas hydrate reservoirs in the Shenhu area in the north slope of the South China Sea, Chinese scientists have proposed two unprecedented techniques that have been verified during the field trials: solid fluidization and formation fluid extraction. Herein, we introduce the two production techniques, as well as the so-called four-in-one environmental monitoring system employed during the Shenhu production test. Methane is not currently commercially produced from gas hydrates anywhere in the world; therefore, the objective of field trials is to prove whether existing techniques could be applied as feasible and economic production methods for gas hydrates in deep-water sediments and permafrost zones. Before achieving commercial methane recovery from gas hydrates, it should be necessary to measure the geologic properties of gas hydrate reservoirs to optimize and improve existing production techniques. Herein, we propose horizontal wells, multilateral wells, and cluster wells improved by the vertical and individual wells applied during existing field trials. It is noteworthy that relatively pure gas hydrates occur in seafloor mounds, within near-surface sediments, and in gas migration conduits. Their extensive distribution, high saturation, and easy access mean that these types of gas hydrate may attract considerable attention from academia and industry in the future. Herein, we also review the occurrence and development of concentrated shallow hydrate accumulations and briefly introduce exploration and production techniques. In the closing section, we discuss future research needs, key issues, and major challenges related to gas hydrate exploration and production. We believe this review article provides insight on past, present, and future gas hydrate exploration and production to provide guidelines and stimulate new work into the field of gas hydrates.",,,,,,,,,59,9,0,0,1,0,63,,,1000-9515,1755-6724,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaPilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Lab Marine Mineral Resources, Qingdao 266071, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaQingdao Inst Marine Geol, Key Lab Gas Hydrate, Minist Nat Resources, Qingdao 266071, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaShengli Petr Engn Corp Ltd, Drilling Technol Res Inst, SINOPEC, Dongying 257017, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaLinyi Univ, Linyi 276000, Shandong, Peoples R China",,,,2019-06-01,WOS:000485021600015,,

Non-isotropic stator teeth width are investigated. This type of asymmetry consists of varying the distance of the slots of the same phase, keeping the slot width constant. This is achieved since each group of slots of the same phase are in parallel. Therefore, by modifying the arrangement of the stator slots, the magnetic circuit is modified, which allows adjusting the electrical parameters of the generator without changing its size.

The DRBM has a large and almost featureless surface making it particularly challenging to accurately and efficiently detect and localize all the defective regions on the surface. To address these challenges, an eye-in-hand monocular vision system is used to generate the DRBM's global surface map.

The first is human centred and the focus is here on the design of work places to allow the operators at the sharp end to function in an optimal way to minimise human errors and mitigate disturbances. The second energy barrier perspective aims at providing technical safety functions on the platform that intervene in the accident path to minimise loss. Accident and incident statistics show that the barrier perspective has been implemented in design to prevent fires and explosions with considerable achievements, whereas its application in occupational accident prevention is more arbitrary. Design of fire and explosion barriers fits well with the current engineering skills and work-processes in investment projects. The implementation of a systematic human-centred design approach is of a more recent date. It has proved to be more demanding and the merits have been more difficult to demonstrate.

From 23 April, when the first oil sheen was noted on the surface, until 15 July, when the well was capped, oil flowed at varying rates from 1500 meters below the surface. Because of the high rate of flow and the use of dispersants, a cloud of oil and gas droplets was trapped between 1000 and 1300 meters depth. As the cloud was moved away by ambient currents, new oil and gas was added to the cloud.Since 2005, oil and gas platforms in the Northern Gulf of Mexico have been collected current profile data as mandated by the former Minerals Management Service (now the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement) in a Notice to Lessees (NTL). The data are transmitted to the National Data Buoy Center, where it would be quality controlled, stored, and broadcast over the Global Telecommunications System. The Deepwater Horizon was equipped with a 38 kHz Teledyne RDI ADCP and transmitted data minutes before the explosion occurred on the platform. Other platforms in the area, including Ram-Powell, Mars, and Holstein were collecting ADCP data during this time.The drilling rig used to drill the relief well, Development Driller 3 was also equipped with a 38 kHz ADCP, as was the Discoverer Enterprise rig used to bring oil and gas to the surface from the riser and BOP. The Development Driller 3 was in place at MC-252 and collecting ADCP data beginning 1 May 2010. The Discoverer Enterprise was drilling 55 km to the south-southwest of the Deepwater Horizon rig at the time it exploded. It remained there for ten days before moving to MC-252, 9 May 2010 to begin offloading oil and gas from the spill and collecting ADCP data. These two ADCP deployments of 38 kHz ADCPs, which penetrate to almost 1200 meters water depth, under good conditions, provided important information at the site of the spill during the time that oil was flowing.The ADCP captures a time history of the direction that the oil and gas cloud moved away from the well head site. Weekly resultant current speed and direction information indicate the transport of the cloud. Additional ADCPs on platforms to the southwest of the Deepwater Horizon site provide information about the transport of the oil and gas clouds as they moved in that direction. CTD cast-based fluorometer and dissolved oxygen signatures of the oil in the months following the spill indicate the extent of the oil cloud at 1000 to 1300 meter depths. Combined with the ADCP data, a time history of the movement of the oil and gas cloud is possible.",,,,,MTS/IEEE OCEANS ConferenceMTS/IEEE OCEANS Conference,"SEP 19-22, 2011SEP 19-22, 2011",Marine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE; OESMarine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE; OES,"Kona, HIKona, HI",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-933957-39-8,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Natl Data Buoy Ctr, Natl Weather Serv, Stennis Space Ctr, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USA",,,,2012-03-21,WOS:000299005800195,,

Where stainless steels have proved inadequate there has been a tendency to utilise high nickel alloys with a greatly increased cost. This paper introduces Zeron 100 super duplex stainless steel and shows how its superior corrosion and stress corrosion cracking resistance, plus its high strength, can be utilised to provide a cost effective alternative to both austenitic stainless steels and high nickel alloys. The composition, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance are discussed, showing that the combination of high strength and excellent corrosion resistance makes it eminently suitable for a wide range of industrial applications.The wide range of product forms in which Zeron 100 is available means that vessels, piping, valves and pumps can be made from a single alloy with no worries about galvanic compatibility. Zeron 100 has now been in service for up to ten years. The material is readily weldable with over one million joints now in service. The paper reviews examples of the applications of Zeron 100 including service experience.In the offshore oil and gas industry Zeron 100 has been used widely for sea water cooling, firewater and deluge systems, and also process pipework and manifolds. It has found particular favour because of the weight savings possibilities on topsides facilities, reducing the need for subsea structural steel. This has been achieved by using smaller diameter sea water piping with higher flow rates, and by utilising wall thickness reductions in process pipework, particularly for streams which operate at high pressure and/or high temperatures.The high strength and hardness of Zeron 100 gives it excellent resistance to erosion and erosion-corrosion and it is widely used for pumps and piping in mining and processing applications. The unique composition of Zeron 100 gives it excellent resistance to a wide range of chemicals including non-oxidising acids.

We also used behavioral observations of brood-rearing adult loons to quantify the frequency of visits by prospecting loons. We hypothesized that increased competition for productive territories would result in a decrease in territory retention rates. Territory retention rates the year following successful breeding attempts were only slightly lower (0.90) than after failed breeding attempts (0.93), and few territories were consistently successful across years. Overall territory retention rates were high (0.92) and similar for both species, suggesting that adults were able to defend their territories successfully. Males had higher territory retention rates than females, but we found no influence of mass (a possible proxy for fighting ability) on territory retention. These observations, coupled with the high frequency of visits by prospecting loons, provide additional evidence that site familiarity may provide advantages to territory holders. Quantifying territory retention behaviors may also inform land management decisions for oil and gas development in areas where loons are present. High territory retention rates, frequency of visits by prospectors, and limited habitat where new territories can be established suggest that breeding habitat in northern Alaska is saturated and may be limiting Yellow-billed Loon populations.

We analyzed 8,756 It of acoustic recordings from different locations and months in Cook Inlet, Alaska, to describe anthropogenic noise, evaluate the potential for acoustic impact to Cook Inlet belugas, and provide management recommendations. Nine total sources of noise were identified: commercial ship, dredging, helicopter, jet aircraft (commercial or military non-fighter), fighter jet, propeller aircraft, outboard motor, pile driving, sub-bottom profiler, as well as four repetitive unidentified noise sources. Several noise metrics were compared across noise sources, months, and locations. A total of 6,263 anthropogenic acoustic events were detected and classified, for a total duration of 1,025 h representing 11.7% of the sound recordings analyzed. Anthropogenic noise was present in every day sampled. The natural background noise (i.e., ambient noise without anthropogenic contribution), in areas where currents and vegetative debris did cause minimal self-noise, was below 120 dBrms re. 1[mu]Pa for 94% to 100% of the time; much lower than previously reported and unsupportive of the current application of the elevated behavioral harassment threshold for non-impulsive noise of 125 dBrms. Based on spectral received levels and spatial and temporal prevalence, several anthropogenic noise sources in Cook Inlet have the potential to chronically mask beluga communication and hearing in most of the locations and periods sampled for this study. Current activities (e.g., shipping, dredging) exceed behavioral harassment levels on a daily basis in a significant portion of the critical habitat. Ship noise was identified as the top priority focus for noise mitigation management actions. A high concentration of noise sources was identified in the lower region of Knik Arm. This area is recommended for further research to evaluate the potential for beluga displacement and the basis to start considering cumulative impact effects in the permitting process. The amount of detected unidentified machinery noise or unclassifiable noises highlights the need for further research in coordination with industry, in particular in areas of oil and gas production (i.e., Trading Bay) or intense shipping related activities (i.e., facilities).

Despite their importance to ecosystem functioning, we lack a general understanding of how bacterial communities respond to climate change, especially in relatively understudied ecosystems like tropical montane wet forests. We used a well-studied and highly constrained 5.2 degrees C mean annual temperature (MAT) gradient in tropical montane wet forests on the Island of Hawaii to test the hypothesis that long-term, whole-ecosystem warming and the accompanying increase in belowground carbon flux increase the diversity and alter the composition of soil bacterial communities. Across this MAT gradient, dominant vegetation, substrate type and age, soil moisture, and disturbance history are constant, allowing us to effectively isolate the influence of rising MAT on soil bacterial community structure. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that the richness, evenness, and phylogenetic diversity of the soil bacterial community remained remarkably stable with MAT and that MAT did not predict variation in bacterial community composition despite a substantial increase in belowground soil carbon fluxes across the gradient. Our results suggest that other factors that are constant across this gradient-such as soil pH, water availability and plant species composition-may be more important than warming in influencing soil bacterial community composition and diversity, at least within the temperature range studied here (similar to 1318 degrees C MAT). Ours is the first study to demonstrate stability of soil bacterial community structure with rising MAT and increased belowground carbon flux in a tropical wet forest ecosystem.

J,,,,,,,,,Andy Ridgwell,,MOlybdenum in the Oceans ('MOO'),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Nov 17 2012,2012,"Our future ocean may look very different from today. Some of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from the burning of fossil fuels is taken up by the ocean surface and changes the acidity of seawater, while the warming associated with higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere is reducing the solubility of oxygen, leading to less oxygen available to animals deeper down. Changes in acidity and oxygenation have implications for a host of other chemical properties of the ocean and may have knock-on impacts on chemical exchanges with the underlying sediments as well as how organisms cycle carbon through the ocean. But while the climate system mostly involves physics and despite what most students may conclude from school: physics is easy, in the ocean, the dynamics of a wide variety of biologically driven and inter-linked chemical cycles are key, and these are far less easy to understand in full.The geological record can help here, because almost everything that could possibly have happened to life in the ocean has happened at one time or another, from partially frozen 'snowball' conditions to something by all accounts more like a hot sulphurous soup. The rock record not only contains geochemical clues about the environmental conditions in the ocean during these events, but also information about how the marine organisms and ecosystems respond. Of particularly interest here are occurrences of intervals of widespread oxygen depletion ('de-oxygenation') in the oceans about 100 millions years ago when dinosaurs roamed the land. These de-oxygenation events are generally associated with climate warming, sometimes with biological extinctions, and always associated with the burial of large amounts of organic carbon in accumulating sediments -- carbon that formed much of the oil and gas we are burning today. Much further (some billion years) back, the oceans first became oxygenated in a series of steps that appear intimately coupled with first the evolution and spread to saltwater environments of photosynthesizing organisms, and later, the appearance of multicellular animals. The relationship between changes in oxygenation and key events in the evolution of life on this planet also demands a full understanding.Our focus here is to gain a better understanding of how the degree of oxygenation of our oceans has changed in the geological past. To do this we will apply a variety of cutting-edge tools: from laboratory experiments, machines to measure the tiniest of differences in the isotopic composition of exotic metals in ancient muds, to computer models and quantum mechanical calculations. Specifically, we will be looking at the element Molybdenum, used commercially in specialist steel making and in catalysts. Molybdenum is relatively abundant in a well oxygenated ocean like we have today, but takes on increasingly more insoluble forms and is lost to the sediments as oxygen becomes scarce in the ocean. Different isotopes of Molybdenum differ slightly in how efficiently they are removed, giving us an additional way of reconstructing past ocean conditions. Computer models will play a central role in our work, as we have neither spare copies of our planet to experiment on, nor a time machine to allow us to get a direct picture of past conditions. Models will allow us to explore how the signature of past changes in ocean oxygenation are recorded in sediments (and hence in the geological record).The result of our work on past ocean oxygenation will, when combined with improved understanding of how marine organisms and ecosystems evolved and responded through time, will lead not only to a better understanding about the co-evolution of life and the planet, but will also provide insights into the biological changes we might expect to see in the ocean in the future.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/J01043X/1,,,,,,,,University of Bristol,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15365055,,

The objectives of this research are to (1) employ a novel experimental design to determine how variation in nutrient availability determines spatial patterns in grassland carbon productivity and (2) provide the first-ever quantification of carbon storage in coastal and dune forests within two priority nature reserves in the southeastern coast of South Africa. Contrasting fire and vegetation patterns within each reserve will allow for the development of new pyrogeographic perspectives on African carbon storage at landscape scales. By studying carbon storage in priority conservation areas in coastal South Africa, this research will establish a deeper understanding of the role of African landscapes in conservation management and global ecosystem science. A current lack of understanding of complex interactions among fire, climate, and nutrient cycling hinders broad-scale modeling of ecosystem response to climate change. This issue is particularly acute for Africa, which represents the largest source of fire-derived carbon emissions and for which carbon storage estimates are scarce. Direct measurement of carbon storage in new locations and identification of its limiting factors across multiple scales, as explored in this project, are critical for the development of future diagnostic modeling efforts. Understanding how fire and soil nutrients govern these patterns will contribute to landscape and conservation management in the region and globally.

One of the most important input parameters for these models is the rise velocity of the fluid particles under the extreme environmental conditions in the deep sea (high pressure, low temperature). The consideration of these conditions in combination with the respective fluid properties, especially the gas solubility in the released crude oil under high pressure, is crucial for both the droplet formation at the wellhead and the drop rise through the water column. A model for the calculation of oil-droplet rise velocities under consideration of the pressure-dependent gas-in-oil solubility is presented and validated via a flowsheet simulation. For this purpose, the concept of internal degassing that leads to a higher buoyancy of the crude-oil droplets and thus an accelerated drop rise is introduced. The calculation of three different drop-rise scenarios shows the high impact of this effect according to the model. For the first time high-pressure experiments using gas-saturated crude oil and artificial seawater in a counter-current flow channel are conducted. The optical recording and analysis of the droplet volume during pressure release confirm the significance of the predicted effect of degassing.

However, before seafloor massive sulfides (SMS) can be considered as a resource, alteration and weathering processes that may affect their metal tenor have to be fully understood. This knowledge cannot be obtained by assessing the surface exposures alone. Seafloor drilling is required to gain information about the third dimension. In 2016, three extinct seafloor massive sulfide mounds, located in the Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse (TAG) hydrothermal area of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge were drilled. A mineralogical and textural comparison of drill core and surface-grab samples revealed that in recent ceased mounds high-temperature copper assemblages typical for black smoker chimneys are still present whereas in longer extinct mounds the mineralogy is pre-dominated by an iron mineral assemblage. Zinc becomes remobilized early in the mound evolution and forms either a layer in the upper part of the mound or has been totally leached from its interior. Precipitation temperatures of sphalerite calculated using the Fe/Zn ratio can help to identify these remobilization processes. While the Fe/Zn ratios of primary sphalerites yield temperatures that are in very good agreement with fluid temperatures measured in white smokers, calculated temperatures for sphalerites affected by remobilization are too high for SMS. Overall drilling of SMS provides valuable information on the internal structure and mineralogy of the shallow sub-surface, however, additional drilling of SMS, at a greater depth, is required to fully understand the processes affecting SMS and their economic potential.",,,,,,,,,10,3,0,0,2,0,12,,,2075-163X,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Oceanog Ctr, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, EnglandUniv Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Waterfront Campus,European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, EnglandBritish Geol Survey, Environm Sci Ctr, Nicker Hill, Keyworth NG12 5GG, Notts, England",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000440860400040,,

However, it also leads to additional greenhouse gas emissions. We estimate the global warming potential of different CO2 capture scenarios with and without enhanced oil recovery. During a 10 year period in which oil and electricity are produced without CO2 being captured, the global warming potential is 11 MtCO(2) equivalents. We show that if CO2 is captured and used for 15 years of enhanced oil recovery, the global warming potential decreases to 3.4 MtCO(2) equivalents. This level is 100% higher compared to the scenario in which the captured CO2 would be stored in an offshore aquifer instead. If the capture of CO2 is stopped when the oil reservoir is depleted, the global warming potential resulting from 10 years electricity production is 6 MtCO(2) equivalents. However, if CO2 is stored in the depleted reservoir, the global warming potential is six times lower during that period. Electricity production and oil refining are the main contributors to the global warming potential. The net present value analysis indicates that for CO2 prices lower than or equal to 15 (sic)/t and oil prices greater than or equal to 115 (sic)/t, it is most profitable to capture CO2 for enhanced oil recovery only. Because of the low CO2 price considered, large incomes from oil production are required to stimulate CO2 capture. The environmental economic trade-off analysis shows that if CO2-enhanced oil recovery is followed by CO2 capture and storage, costs increase, but the net present value remains positive and the global warming potential is reduced. Authorities could use these outcomes to support the development of economic mechanisms for shared investments in CO2 capture installations and to mandate both oil producer and large CO2 emitting firms to store CO2 in depleted oil fields.",,,,,,,,,19,1,0,0,3,0,21,,,0301-4797,1095-8630,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Antwerp, Dept Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, BelgiumHasselt Univ, Ctr Environm Sci, Agoralaan Bldg D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, BelgiumUniv Liege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Econ & Rural Dev Unit, Passage Deportes 2, B-5030 Gembloux, BelgiumRoyal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Geol Survey Belgium, Jennerstr 13, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",,,,2019-06-04,WOS:000465366100020,30901695,

Several development alternatives are available for a given offshore petroleum field. The selection of the most suitable system for a given scenario depends on field development characteristics and strategies such as its geographical location, water depth, environmental conditions and knowledge about similar systems already selected and in use for oil and gas production and available infrastructure in around. For the purpose of field production system design a database with types of production platforms, mooring systems, subsea equipments, reservoir main characteristics, type of wells and lifting processes is fundamental. Today, offshore petroleum reservoir production is more and more complex due to several variables involved and requirement needed to meet deep and ultra deep water depth, pre-salt petroleum with aggressive fluid characteristics, fields in remote areas and other environmental issues. Large fields in deep and ultra deep water are particularly challenging due to little availability of suitable platform types, among known concepts such as floating, production, storage and offloading unit (IPSO), semisubmersible, spar and tension leg platform (TLP). In the present paper, a database for worldwide offshore petroleum systems in use has been elaborated by searching data available in the literature. The database is organized for more than three hundred platforms distributed on more than four hundred different offshore oil fields. To serve as a basis for the conceptual design of a field production system, this database contains information such as type of the platform, field location, water depth, days for the first production, type of well, completion, mooring system, riser and offloading system. This information is structured for different water depth and environmental condition, for each field. From this database, analysis has been conducted for distribution of each type of platform by worldwide region, distribution of each type of platform by the offshore field by region, among others analysis. Concept of Utility Functions are applied to represent technological trends and to be helpful in the process. Among the results, a preference for FPSOs and semisubmersible was observed in Brazil offshore, semisubmersible, TLPs and Spars in Gulf of Mexico. In Europe, particularly the North Sea, FPSO, semisubmersible, and few TLPs have been found. In West Africa, most of the field production is based on FPSOs, although some semisubmersible and TLP could be observed. Similar analyses were conducted in other regions. Results and discussions show preferences regarding technology selected by each region, region historical data, and growth of water depth in different fields.",,,,,"30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2011JUN 19-24, 2011","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Rotterdam, NETHERLANDSRotterdam, NETHERLANDS",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4433-5,,,,,,,,,"Univ Estadual Campinas, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Petr Engn, Campinas, SP, BrazilUniv Estadual Campinas, Grad Program, Petr Sci & Engn, Campinas, SP, Brazil",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000314666100070,,

These immense, seemingly hostile, and similar environments have experienced two very different directions of regional development. Louisiana developed much earlier, focusing initially on the extraction of renewable resources from the coastal marsh. Later, by the 1920s, the discovery of oil and gas led to the rapid development of an offshore, nonrenewable extractive system that is literally unparalleled on the planet. In contrast, at the time of early settlement, southern Florida had fewer recognized renewable or nonrenewable resources; its development began later, centered around amenity use rather than consumptive use of resources. In spite of potentially massive economic benefits, Florida has bitterly fought recent attempts at offshore ail or gas exploitation, and coastal tourism in Louisiana seems as unlikely as offshore development in Florida. At the same time, however, there are significant challenges to the continued vitality of both the oil-based economy of southern Louisiana and the tourism-based economy of southern Florida. The two contrasting cases provide examples of developmental channelization. On the one hand, once an area or region takes a given developmental direction, both the process of specialization in a given primary activity and the investment of human and economic capital in the capture of linkages tied to that primary activity can set in motion a process that may effectively preclude other developmental options. On the other hand, a given course of development can also be pursued so intensively as to bring about its demise.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,0,21,,,0894-1920,1521-0723,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT RURAL SOCIOL, MADISON, WI 53706 USA",,,,1996-09-01,WOS:A1996VR54400003,,

In the 1990s the global carbon survey of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) inspired the development of several approaches for estimating anthropogenic carbon inventories in the ocean interior. Most approaches agree that the total global ocean inventory of C-ant was around 120 Pg C in the mid-1990s. Today, the ocean carbon uptake rate estimates suggest that the ocean is not keeping pace with the CO2 emissions growth rate. Repeat occupations of the WOCE/JGOFS survey lines consistently show increases in carbon inventories over the last decade, but have not yet been synthesized enough to verify a slowdown in the carbon storage rate.

Six well-experienced informants were asked to individually provide information about goliath grouper abundance and distribution, drawn over a satellite image of the study area, which was later overlaid and gathered into a final map. According to our informants, the goliath grouper occurs along a broad salinity and depth range, from shallow estuarine areas (less than 5 m deep) with high freshwater input (smaller individuals, up to 150 kg) to coastal marine-dominated environments (at least 35 m deep); (larger individuals more common, frequently reaching more than 300 kg). Fishermen referred to goliath groupers inhabiting hard substrates such as rocky reefs around islands and continental shores, submerged rocky outcrops and shipwrecks (juveniles and adults). At least two aggregation sites mapped (ranging from 2 to 60 individuals) could be concluded as spawning aggregation sites through evidence of high abundance and spawning activity. Priority research and conservation targets were identified and discussed for Babitonga Bay (e.g., design of a tagging experimental program and establishment of a marine protected area). Fishers' resource mapping provided a means of exchanging information among various disciplines while maintaining methodological rigor in a clear and straightforward way of presenting fishers' knowledge.

We also calculate the pipeline volumetric break-even point yielding the minimum CO2 volume required from a specific site for pipeline to become the less costly transport option and finally, we investigate the effect injectivity may have on the choice of reservoir and transport mode. Most stationary CO2-emissions in the Nordic region originate from emission intensive industries such as steel, cement and chemical plants and refineries. Typically, their emissions are modest (less than 1 Mt per year) compared to large coal fired power plants, while distances to potential storage sites are considerable, often 300 km or more. Hence, build-up of clusters of emission sources and CO2-volumes is likely to take time and be costly. At the same time, many of the emission sources, both fossil based and biogenic, are located along the coast line. The results imply that due to modest CO2-volumes and relatively long transport distances CO2 transport by ship is the least costly transportation option for most of the sources individually as well as for most of the potential cluster combinations during ramp-up of the CCS transport and storage infrastructure. It is furthermore shown that cost of ship transport increases modestly with increasing transport distance which, in combination with poor injectivity in reservoirs in the Baltic Sea, indicate that it may be less costly to transport the CO2 captured from Finnish and Swedish sources located along the Baltic Sea a further 800-1300 km to the west by ship for storage in aquifers with higher injectivity in the Skagerrak region or in the North Sea.

Under uncertainty, neither the regulator nor the regulated firms know what needs to be done. The regulator must induce firms to systematically canvas their practices and identify potential hazards. But recognizing the fallibility of all such efforts, the regulator must further foster the institutionalization of incident or event reporting procedures: systems to register failures in products or production processes that could be precursors to catastrophe; to trace out and correct their root causes; to alert others in similar situations to the potential hazard; and to make certain that countermeasures to ensure the safety of current operations are taken and the design requirements for the next generation of the implicated components or installations are updated accordingly.

The high values of the R-2 values for the two measurements were highly reliable, with the reliability of the linear regression function higher than that of the functions of 2 variables. The artificial seaweed forest constructed in the barren ground was highly comparable with natural seaweed forest in terms of growth, indicating that the artificial seaweed construction can be done in an easy, efficient and economically viable way. This further indicates that the technology developed by the present study can be extensively used for the project for artificial seaweed forest construction.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,5,0,8,,,0254-8704,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Fisheries Res & Dev Inst, Kangnung 210861, South KoreaKorea Fisheries Resources Agcy, Pusan 612020, South Korea",Natl Fisheries Res & Dev InstKorea Fisheries Resources Agcy,,,2012-10-24,WOS:000308280200021,23734467,

As a result, service life of existing fixed jacket platforms need to be extended. The overall reliability of aged platform has to be reevaluated in order to monitor the integrity of the structure, and to prevent unexpected failures. Reserve Strength Ratio (RSR) is a widely adopted measure to quantify the ultimate strength of a structure. However, structural strength alone is inadequate to express a structure's reliability. Reliability is best defined as the probability that the extreme load will not exceed the ultimate strength of a structure. It can be expressed either in probability of failure or reliability index, which is the inverse normalized form of probability of failure.

The studied interval begins in the continental upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation (early Maastrichtian) and continues to the base of the marine Bearpaw Shale (late Campanian) encompassing 358 m. A total of 152 horizons were sampled for magnetostratigraphy, and 48 horizons for palynostratigraphy. Four magnetozones (31r, 32n, 32r and 33n), 26 magnetosubzones and 8 cryptozones, a subdivision of a subzone, were identified. Most of the subzones had been previously identified in the Red Deer Valley outcrops. Magnetozone 32n in the CPOG core is only 70 per cent as thick as in the Red Deer Valley. Most of this difference occurs within the interval of coals 1 to 9 of the Red Deer Valley. The palynomorphs provide important information on the ranges of a number of key species that allow comparisons to other equivalent age sites in southern Alberta. These ranges indicate that the top of the CPOG Strathmore well is considerably younger than the top of Castor well as documented in Lerbekmo et al. (2003). The palynological results support the conclusions arrived at during the paleomagnetostratigraphic studies.

Two case studies (Shetland Islands and the North East region) were selected from Scotland, on the basis of their geographical (island versus mainland) and sectoral representation. The challenges facing these areas are typical for many coastal communities around the world.An outline of the current decline in fishing activity is described, with a spotlight on Scotland, to illustrate trends and issues at stake. The relationships between onshore human settlements, employment prospects and offshore activities including aquaculture, fishing, oil and gas, are explained. A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis summarises emerging questions and new developments, highlighting the need to include information on social and economic factors in management plans and formulation of policy. The case study profiles inform on advances in economic and social diversification opportunities, e.g. through aquaculture, leisure and tourism initiatives. In recognition of the declining economic value of the oil industry to Shetland, this community has adopted a policy to identify and encourage potential development opportunities in its traditional industries, e.g. supporting fishing activities. In contrast, the North East of Scotland's approach is to create a more diverse sustainable economy by broadening its business base and re-training its workforce. Lessons learnt from the case studies are considered in the context of how they can aid current developments in policy such as the UK's efforts towards implementing the European Commission's recommendations on ICZM.

J,,,,,,,,,Robert Dorrell,,"The, statistically-Unsteady, Next generation Sediment Transport model for Environmental flows",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2020,2020,"The transport of sediment by environmental flows shapes the world around us. Our ability to predict sediment transport is therefore key to a range of disciplines and sectors, and is critical to water, energy and food security. For example, accurate sediment transport prediction is key in the management of natural environments, screening and mitigation of geohazard risks, design and operation of offshore windfarms and exploitation of natural resources. Research in these areas directly addresses key UK and global challenges, including clean and secure energy, geohazard resilience and ecosystem management in changing natural and societal environments. Despite its clear importance, state-of-the-art predictive sediment transport models are still based on a century-old paradigm, recognised as flawed, and of limited applicability, even when first proposed. Therefore, our current ability to predict sediment transport in real-world environments is limited. Predicting sediment transport is dependent on understanding how much material is kept aloft, suspended in flowing water. Current models of sediment suspension are inaccurate, dependent on a model of mixing of slowly-settling particles, over vanishingly small length-scales, by random fluid motion (turbulence). However, recognised even when first developed, these models are based on flawed assumptions of the role and scale of turbulence in real-world flows. Moreover, recent research spanning earth sciences and mathematics highlights that chaotic, turbulent fluid motion is not always entirely random. Under many conditions coherent structures can develop, and in atmospheric flows it has been shown that coherent structures result in self-organisation. The emergence of self-organisation from chaos is fascinating, operating against preconceived notions of increasing entropy, and hinting at higher levels of physical complexity than is currently understood.Building on my multidisciplinary background, covering mathematics and earth sciences, and collaborating with international experts in academia and industry, I will undertake the first study of the development of coherent structures and self-organisation in sediment-laden environmental flows. To achieve this, this Fellowship aims to integrate recent developments in theoretical and empirical research of turbulent flows - with the objective of making a step-change in the way in which sediment suspensions are modelled. Such integrated research is not only crucial, but it is also timely, only now possible due to scientific and technological advances made in the past decade. Critical to this is University of Hull commitment to directly support development of a globally unique stratified flow facility for studying suspended sediment transport. Moreover, I will advance the Fellowship research to study real-world systems, where the composition of sediment suspensions vary, enabling impact across the applied sciences. Working with international collaborators, I will apply these sediment transport models to help constrain the magnitude and frequency of geohazard risk posed by environmental flows.Synergistic to the Fellowship 2xPhDs , funded by the University of Hull, will facilitate impact as students will apply Fellowship research to address challenges in energy security, geohazard resilience and ecosystem management. Direct engagement with academic, industrial and government collaborators will maximise impact throughout the Fellowship. Collaboration will enable me to naturally develop a Centre for Environmental Fluid Dynamics at the University of Hull, which I will use to develop and broaden Fellowship research studying the impact of the built environment, e.g. offshore windfarms, on environmental flows and the mechanics of high-concentration flows. Thus, this Fellowship, and subsequent research, will enable me to address current and future societal challenges in earth surface science as a research leader in environmental fluid dynamics.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/S014535/1,,,,,,,,University of Hull,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15308125,,

The Eggerding Formation and the lower part of the Zupfing Formation have been studied using core and cuttings samples and a multidisciplinary approach involving core description, geochemistry, palynology and nannopaleontology.The Dynow Formation and the lower part of the Eggerding Formation were deposited during nannoplankton zone NP23 (Martini, 1971). The transition between the Dynow and Eggerding formations is characterized by a gradual decrease in carbonate contents. The Eggerding Formation deposited in near-shore environments contains several sand layers. In contrast, the Eggerding Formation deposited along the northern slope is generally poor in sand. Its lower part consists of dark grey laminated shaly marlstone with white bands rich in coccolithophorides. TOC contents are about 5 %. The upper part of the Eggerding Formation consists of a homogenous sequence of marly shale and includes in average 1.6 % TOC.Oxygen deficient conditions prevailed during deposition of the Eggerding Formation. Marine palynomorphs are present in all samples from the Eggerding Formation, but calcareous nannoplankton is restricted to its lower part. Salinity variations are recorded in rocks of the lower part of the Eggerding Formation. The environment during deposition of its upper part was more stable. Log signatures, which are comparable over tens of kilometres, provide evidence for the lateral continuity of the Eggerding Formation deposited on the upper slope.Slope instabilities are indicated by slumps and extensive submarine slides. Sliding reached a maximum at the transition from the Eggerding to the Zupfing Formation, when locally a succession up to 70 m thick was removed from the northern slope. The slided material was redeposited either on the northern slope or at the base of the slope.The Eggerding Formation is overlain by the Zupfing Formation (NP24), consisting of clay marl up to 450 m thick. Oxygen-depleted conditions continued during deposition of the Zupfing Formation, but only the lowermost few meters of the Zupfing Formation (Transition Zone) are rich in organic matter (1.5 % TOC).Whereas the lower part of the Eggerding Formation (TOC 1.9-6.0 %; HI up to 600 mg HC/g TOC) holds a very good source potential for oil (and gas), its upper part and the Transition Zone (TOC: similar to 1.5 %; true HI 500-600 mg HC/g TOC) are characterized by a good potential.

To understand the impacts of these stressors, it is crucial to develop assessments of forest properties to establish baselines, determine the extent of changes, and provide information to ecosystem modeling activities. Here we report on spatial patterns of characteristics of forest ecosystems in the western United States, including area, stand age, forest type, and carbon stocks, and comparisons of these patterns with those from satellite imagery and simulation models. The USDA Forest Service collected ground-based measurements of tree and plot information in recent decades as part of nationwide forest inventories. Using these measurements together with a methodology for estimating carbon stocks for each tree measured, we mapped county-level patterns across the western United States. Because forest ecosystem properties are often significantly different between hardwood and softwood species, we describe patterns of each. The stand age distribution peaked at 60 100 years across the region, with hardwoods typically younger than softwoods. Forest carbon density was highest along the coast region of northern California, Oregon, and Washington and lowest in the arid regions of the Southwest and along the edge of the Great Plains. These results quantify the spatial variability of forest characteristics important for understanding large-scale ecosystem processes and their controlling mechanisms. To illustrate other uses of the inventory-derived forest characteristics, we compared them against examples of independently derived estimates. Forest cover compared well with satellite-derived values when only productive stands were included in the inventory estimates. Forest types derived from satellite observations were similar to our inventory results, though the inventory database suggested more heterogeneity. Carbon stocks from the Century model were in good agreement with inventory results except in the Pacific Northwest and part of the Sierra Nevada, where it appears that harvesting and. re in the 20th century ( processes not included in the model runs) reduced measured stand ages and carbon stocks compared to simulations.",,,,,,,,,29,2,0,0,20,0,33,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Idaho, Dept Geog, Moscow, ID 83844 USAUniv Vermont, Gund Inst Ecol Econ, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USAH John Heinz III Ctr Sci Econ & Environm, Washington, DC 20006 USAUniv New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources, Durham, NH 03824 USA",H John Heinz III Ctr Sci Econ & Environm,,,2007-12-01,WOS:000251739800021,18213977,

Similarly, offshore installations should be designed according to the accurate limit states, but the actual ice loads are uncertain so this is not possible at present. Risk-based design methodologies using first principal methods offer a way to advance safe operations and transport of natural resources within and out of the Arctic Sea. This paper introduces a holistic treatment of the design relevant features and their identification to improve safe Arctic operations and transport.

J,,,,,,,,,Flávio Dias Passos,,"Biodiversity and biogeography of benthonic animals from the deep-sea: a study of the Brazilian Caudofoveata (Mollusca, Aplacophora)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Oct 01 2018,2018,"The marine molluscs constitute an important part of the Brazilian biodiversity, which is more well-known from its shallow water species. Gastropods, bivalves and cephalopods are the largest and better investigated groups, while other smaller ones which are more restricted to greater depths are sometimes completely neglected. This is the case of the Aplacophora, which is diverse in the deep-sea, being also very abundant in some places, but rarely studied because its species are not easily collected; the techniques for their studies are not so usual too. These molluscs have a characteristic cylindrical, elongated body, covered by spicules, and are generally very small animals. The interests on these animals are growing up in recent years for their phylogenetic importance. In the more recent literature they have been considered as a monophyletic group, composed by two taxa, the Caudofoveata and the Solenogastres, externally distinguished, basically, by the presence of a pedal groove only occurring in the latter ones. For the Atlantic Ocean, records of aplacophoran species are more common from the northern hemisphere, the knowledge regarding those from the South America being more restricted. Specially in Brazilian waters, they were never studied in detail, but more recently they have been collected in places where there are intense efforts for oil and gas exploitation, in the southeast and in the northeast coasts. Aiming to investigate the patterns of distribution of these animals in the Atlantic Ocean, collections containing thousands of specimens of Brazilian Caudofoveata will be studied, seeking to identify them to the species level, to record the new occurrences and to describe the ones which are new. This study is, in fact, currently in practice, through observations made by light and scanning electron microscopies; special methods were developed in UNICAMP, resulting in great data, including in published papers. In this Project, the Brazilian species will be investigated in a larger context, as a part of reviews on all the Atlantic Ocean species of the genera Falcidens and Chaetoderma (Chaetodermatidae), and of the families Limifossoridae and Prochaetodermatidae, these groups being the better represented ones in the collections from Brazil. Through comparisons among these different species and modelling their geographical distribution, the occurrence of sister-species will be investigated in the deep Atlantic, also revealing distinct distribution patterns as, for example, bipolar, amphi-Atlantic, and endemic or widely distributed species (among others). This is a pioneer Project for the Brazilian fauna, to be made together with national and foreign researchers, involving new students that will be specialized on the taxonomy of molluscs, and specially on those from the deep-sea; one PhD student is already involved in these studies, with a FAPESP fellowship (Proc. 2017/01081-5).

This work aims to evaluate through electrochemical and constant displacement tests the effectiveness of thermal spray aluminium (TSA) coating to mitigate SSC and HIC in high strength steel used to manufacture the tensile armour of a flexible riser. Electrochemical tests confirmed the anodic behaviour of the coating against the steel and estimated a service life of 2.5 years. The constant displacement WA indicated that the non-coated samples failed by SSC although some cracks were also found in the samples mid-section due to HIC. For Al-coated samples, no signs of SSC and HIC were observed. The TSA coating showed a dual barrier effect, hindering either corrosion of steel or hydrogen up-taking, and neither SSC nor HIC was observed.

These include slow and variable rates of penetration (ROP), drilling fluid losses, drill bit or string sticking, overpressured formations, wellbore spatting and collapse. In this contribution we investigate features of large igneous province (LIP). volcanic facies that may directly contribute to drilling complications. Combining borehole and field based examples we identify highly vesicular brecciated lava flow tops and hydro-volcanic facies as a major potential cause of catastrophic drilling fluid losses. The risk for drilling losses is generally higher in the upper parts of thick volcanic successions where hydrothermal secondary mineralization and alteration may be less pervasive. We demonstrate how these fades may be identified early by integrating real time mud logging data with characteristic drill cuttings and LWD (logging while drilling) wireline data as it becomes available. We highlight the potential of basaltic formations to maintain porosity and permeability to greater depths than is typical for sediments due to the high compressive strength of crystalline basalt frameworks. The heterogeneous sub surface distribution of key volcanic facies commonly includes intimate mixing and layering of hard and dense with soft and weak volcanic rock which may promote complex in-situ stresses to develop during burial compaction. Where this occurs, wellbore stability predictions such as the fracture and wellbore collapse gradients for volcanic sequences may deviate from those expected in basin equivalent sedimentary sequences. Examples of swelling volcanic clay horizons, unstable volcaniclastic sequences, and intrusion related ledge effects are used to characterize the main causes of drill bit and string sticking. A greater understanding of drilling complications encountered within prospective areas containing volcanic sequences is needed if better pre-drilling risk assessment, cost prediction, real-time identification and mitigation is to be achieved.

We evaluate an intensified 3D cell immobilisation approach with a small water demand, by coating latex binders onto defined surface area (947 m(2) m(-3)) and void space (81.78 +/- 4.41 %) loofah sponge scaffolds, forming porous 3D biocomposites with three microalgae species; freshwater Chlorella vulgaris, marine Dunaliella salina and Nannochloropsis oculata, and two strains of freshwater Synechococcus elongatus cyanobacteria. Binder toxicity and adhesion screening protocols were established ahead of eight weeks semi-batch and six weeks continuous CO2 fixation trials. Acrylic and polyurethane binders were effective for microalgae, and bio-based (Replebin (R)) binders were suited for cyanobacteria. The highest average net CO2 fixation rates from each species were 0.17 +/- 0.01, 0.25 +/- 0.01, 0.12 +/- 0.01, 0.68 +/- 0.18 and 0.93 +/- 0.30 g CO2 g(biomass)(-1) d(-1) for C. vulgaris, D. salina, N. oculata, S. elongatus PCC 7942 and S. elongatus CCAP 1479/1A respectively.

Offshore is central to the history of the petroleum industry over the last 50 years, and the GOM is the most explored, drilled, and developed offshore petroleum province in the world. In recent decades, revenue from offshore leasing has been second only to federal income taxes in value to the U. S. treasury. During the last 30 years, the search for oil and gas has continually moved into deeper waters and into new offshore environments. Still, the GOM remains the primary laboratory for technological innovation and regulatory practices.

We began collections of Coquina clams (Donax spp.) from the surf zone of Florida Panhandle beaches to monitor PAH contamination to compliment analysis of surf zone sand samples. These clams had higher levels of PAHs relative to ambient sand, and this allowed us to continue to monitor PAH levels after sand concentrations fell below limits of detection. PAH levels in the Coquina tissues were highly variable, perhaps indicative of the heterogeneous distribution of oil and tar on the beaches and exposure to tar particles. Overall, PAH levels decreased continuously in both sand and Coquina tissues, reaching limits of detection within one and two years respectively after oil landed on Florida Panhandle beaches. Our work suggests these surf zone molluscs may be used to monitor pollutant exposure along high energy sandy beach shorelines. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we combined an aerosol-climate model and a coupled climate-carbon model to study the carbon cycle and climate effects caused by fire-emitted aerosols (FEA) forcing at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface. This forcing ('best guess' present-day values of -0.10 and -1.3 W m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere and surface, respectively) had a predominant cooling influence that altered regional land carbon stocks on decadal timescales by modifying vegetation productivity and soil-litter decomposition. Changes in regional land and ocean carbon stocks became much stronger for FEA forcing acting on multi-century timescales; this occurred because carbon stocks responded to the forcing itself on such timescales and also due to gradual effects on the climate (e.g. through increased sea ice cover) that further affected the carbon cycle. Carbon increases and decreases in different regions partly offset each other, so that absolute changes in global land, atmosphere, and ocean stocks were all < 2 Pg C after 30 years of FEA forcing and < 6 Pg C after more than 1000 years of FEA forcing. FEA-caused changes in land carbon storage did not substantially modify the magnitude of FEA emissions, suggesting there is no consequential regional-scale positive feedback loop between these two elements. However, we found indications that the FEA-caused cooling from frequently-burning regions in Africa and Australia increased land carbon stocks in eastern South America and equatorial Asia, respectively. This suggests the potential for remote carbon cycle effects from regions emitting large amounts of fire aerosols.",,,,,,,,,14,1,0,0,2,0,14,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Concordia Univ, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, 1455 Boul Maisonneuve Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, CanadaFinnish Meteorol Inst, Climate Change, POB 503, Helsinki 00101, FinlandUniv Sherbrooke, Dept Geomat Appl, 2500 Boul Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada",,,,2017-02-01,WOS:000395079000001,,

The hydrodynamic models of three main types of floating platforms, e. g. the Semi-submersible, tension leg platform (TLP), and Truss Spar, which could potentially be utilized in the South China Sea, were established by using the 3-D potential theory. Additionally, some important considerations which significantly influence the hydrodynamics were given. The RAOs in frequency domains as well as global motions in time domains under time-varying wind, random waves, and current in 100-y, 10-y, and 1-y return period environment conditions were predicted, compared, and analyzed. The results indicate that the heave and especially the pitch motion of the TLP are favorable. The heave response of the Truss Spar is perfect and comparable with that of the TLP when the peak period of random waves is low.

Availability of suitable habitat is important for flying migrants, and in particular for large birds that use the energetically expensive flapping flight mode, such as the Bewick's Swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii). Bewick's Swans largely feed on aquatic macrophytes during migration that may disappear when nutrient levels, waves, and turbidity exceed certain thresholds. Macrophyte collapse has been suggested as a reason for the sharp decline of the Bewick's Swan population during 1995-2015. We used Bewick's Swans fitted with GPS/GSM neck collars including an accelerometer and water sensor to record the occurrence of aquatic foraging in remote stopovers along their migratory route. We concentrated on spring migration, when stopovers are longer than during autumn, and focused on four key sites identified in earlier tracking studies. Within these sites, we identified areas that are protected based on the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA). During three years (2017-2019), we obtained a total of 51 complete spring tracks of adult female Bewick's Swans. Most swans showed aquatic foraging along the coast of Estonia and in Dvina Bay, and about half in the Gulf of Finland and Cheskaya Bay. In Estonia and in the Gulf of Finland, swans predominantly used protected zones, but in Dvina Bay swans also foraged extensively in areas that are currently not protected according to WDPA. No protected areas occur in Cheskaya Bay. Macrophyte vegetation is threatened by ongoing or planned construction works in the Gulf of Finland and Dvina Bay, and by future oil and gas exploitation in Cheskaya Bay. Our study shows how migrants can be used as sentinels to pinpoint areas that require protection in order to maintain a chain of suitable stopovers on their migration.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,1712-6568,,,,,,,,,,,"Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Anim Ecol, Wageningen, NetherlandsUniv Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Dept Theoret & Computat Ecol, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,,,2021-01-22,WOS:000604981300014,,

Taking this into perspective, the marine subsea industry has become one of the most developing sectors involving many stakeholders with a wide range of background to perform various operations. These operations bring together marine operators, ship owners, subsea asset owners/asset operators, subsea equipment manufacturers, various subcontractors, ship yards, etc., to work together under demanding conditions. Due to high-risk nature of oil and gas business, such operations constitute various critical features requiring specific measures to reduce unwanted events and risk exposure. The permit to work (PTW) system is such a critical measure, which is an integral part of a safe working structure that can help to manage the wide range of activities taking place simultaneously. Risk assessment and risk mitigation, which are core elements for the PTW system, are key contributors for safe execution of jobs. A comprehensive PTW system should not only determine how the work can be carried out safely but also should envisage human factors involved in operations. In addition to generic features that are relevant to normal PTW systems, there are specific needs to account for the nuances of the marine subsea industry. This is to increase the safety as well as efficiency of operations especially under demanding conditions in terms of time, cost, and safety. Years of experiences have begun to question if PTW systems should be applied to all activities since current practices have a considerable potential to lead to many confusions among stakeholders weakening the overall effectiveness. This would require a closer analysis of the current PTW systems and practices to ensure safety integrity as well as to establish an effective work interface between stakeholders.",,,,,10th World Congress on Engineering Asset Management (WCEAM)10th World Congress on Engineering Asset Management (WCEAM),"SEP 28-30, 2015SEP 28-30, 2015",Tech Univ Tampere; VTT Tech Res Ctr FinlandTech Univ Tampere; VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland,"Tampere, FINLANDTampere, FINLAND",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2195-4356,,978-3-319-27064-7; 978-3-319-27062-3,,,,,,,,,"Univ Stavanger, Ctr Ind Asset Management CIAM, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",,,,2016-06-08,WOS:000375993100029,,

The model can consider the influence of frictional resistance induced by drilling mud discharge and elastic potential energy due to axial elongation on the recoil response. The clearance between the Low Marine Riser Package (LMRP) and the blowout preventer (BOP) after disconnection is figured out through solving the governing equations. Then, the parameter sensitivity analysis is given to present a comprehensive understanding of the recoil response. Analysis results show that the phase difference has a significant influence on the recoil response. The most favorable phase difference is 60 degrees. The possibility of collision between the LMRP and the BOP increases with water depth and amplitude of the DAT. The top tensioner has an optimal heave motion frequency, which is the most advantageous for implementing riser emergency disconnection.

We used a Russian peat corer to extract vertical segments of sediment in 50 cm increments, continuing to core with increasing depth until a hard rock or sand basement was reached. Each core segment was photographed, the depths of any change in horizon measured, and the materials in each horizon roughly characterized. In the field, a labelled jar was used to contain each sample, which we later dried, ground, and weighed before precisely measuring the amount of C in each by CN elemental analysis and gas chromatography, ultimately estimating the amount of C stored in the entire forest. Mangrove forests are packed with carbon, typically with more than 100 kilogram of carbon in just one square meter, more than in any other type of tropical forest. Even though the mangrove trees that we see do not compare in height and girth with those in upland tropical rainforests, they manage more than their share of carbon storage underground, in their vast root systems. The organic matter sequestered in the roots of these trees does not decompose quickly, and so thick layers of organic-rich peat are deposited over time, sometimes reaching several meters deep, spanning hundreds of years, and containing tons of carbon. Our goal in this project was to measure how much carbon is stored in the mangrove peat in the forests near the Bay of La Paz. These data depths and carbon and nitrogen contents of sedimentary layers in eight forests near La Paz, BCS, Mexico, sampled in July and August 2014, as well as information on the areal extent and location of each mangrove site. We sampled forests from a range of sizes (0.02 km^2 to 0.96 km^2), and in both the water's edge, or fringe, and the land's edge, or hinterland. The results show the great depth and large carbon stores of mangrove peat deposits in some forests in the southern Gulf of California and the considerable variation in the quantity of peat from one local forest to another.

However, welding is unwanted hotwork on floating offshore units (FOUs) such as floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) and floating, storage and offloading (FSO) vessels because it requires shutdown of parts of the vessel thus resulting in expensive production delays. Bonded fibre composite material patch repairs can be used as an alternative to overcome the hazards of hotwork associated with welding. The patches are bonded over the defect and the integrity of the original structure is hence restored. The patch repair technology can also be utilised to provide upgrades, such as life extensions and higher design requirements.A recommended practice (RP) has been developed that describes requirements for patch repairs used in FOUs. To provide flexibility and to fit different repair needs, the RP defines a range of Repair Classes that can be used depending on the urgency of the repair and the need for optimisation. The qualification effort increases with the degree of optimisation. The requirements are based on an extensive test program carried out in the laboratory (reported elsewhere) as well as experience from full-scale repair demonstrators.Two full-scale repair demonstrators were carried out on actual FOUs to demonstrate the feasibility of the RP for bonded composite patch repair. In addition the demonstrators also showed the viability of using bonded composite repairs under harsh conditions encountered in oil and gas exploration and production environments. The first repair was carried out to arrest a fatigue crack that had developed from the corner of a door, while the second repair was carried out to restore material loss on a heavily pitted deck floor. Both repair cases are used as examples to demonstrate the proposed qualification procedures whilst at the same time discussing the challenges and potential applications of this patch repair technology for FOUs in the oil and gas industry.

Methane seeps related to gas hydrate degradation on the seafloor are ubiquitous on continental slopes in both active and passive continental margins. A previous series of articles suggest that hydrate dissociation (gas release or ebullition at large scale) mainly occurs as a result of faulting or decreased lithostatic pressure triggered by many external driving forces (mainly including tectonic activities, overpressure zone, earthquake and fides), and temperature change. These frequently affect methane inputs into the atmosphere, fueling seafloor oxygen consumption or ocean acidification, and even posing submarine geohazards. Gas hydrate-related areas are usually estimated from indirect biochemical indications (cold-seep communities, element and isotopic anomalies in pore water) and geophysical indications (surface morphology, gas plumes and pathways). Therefore, appropriate application of monitoring and detection methods is of crucial significance for assessing the temporal and spatial variability of related environmental indicators in gas hydrate reservoirs. Monitoring is also as an essential support for harvesting this potential alternative energy in ways that are safer, more economical, and more environmentally friendly. Following the three structural elements of a hydrocarbon seep pumping system (gas/fluid source, fluid migration pathway, and seeping structures at or near the seafloor), this paper sets forth the significance of indicators for dynamics resulting from the destabilization of reservoirs of natural gas hydrates, reviews the corresponding monitoring or detection methods and integrated monitoring systems; and especially, expatiates the in situ observation networks regarding gas hydrate reservoirs and gas hydrate production tests.

Here, we collected GHG flux, plant biomass, and litter decomposition data from three distinct vegetation zones (Spartina alterniflora, Juncus roemerianus and Spartina patens) on a 7-year-old created brackish marsh in North Carolina, USA, and integrate these data into an overall C mass balance budget. The marsh fixed an average of 1.85 g Cm-2 day(-1) through plant photosynthesis. About 41-46% of the fixed C remained in plants, while 18.4% of the C was decomposed and released back to the atmosphere as CO2 and CH4, and 8.6-13.2% of the decomposed C was stored as soil C. In all, this created marsh sequestered 28.7-44.7 Mg CO2 year(-1) across the 14 ha marsh. Because the brackish marsh emitted only small amounts of CH4 and N2O, the CO2 equivalent emission of the marsh was -0.87 to -0.56 g CO2-eq m(-2) day(-1), indicating the marsh has a net effect in reducing GHGs to the atmosphere and contributes to cooling. However, resultant CO2 credit (through the increment of soil C) would be worth only $30.76-$47.90 USD per hectare annually, or $431-$671 per year for the project, which, coupled with other enhanced ecosystem services, could provide landowners with some additional economic incentive for future creation projects.

The main requirement is to have continuous ice of sufficient thickness to support the intended loadings. Ice has been used to support heavy loads, both mobile and stationary and long-term loads such as oil and gas drilling rigs. It has been used to support the installation of offshore pipelines and related facilities. The paper describes the various uses of ice as a load-bearing medium and presents methods for determining required thicknesses.The bending of floating ice under applied load causes flexural stress to be imposed on the ice cross section. Because ice is weak in tension, the critical stress is the maximum tensile stress at the bottom of the ice directly under the load. The paper presents standard methods of calculating the maximum, extreme fibre stress for different types of loads and presents an allowable stress for safe use of the ice as a load-bearing medium. This allowable stress is also instrumental in ensuring that long term, creep deformation does not result in submergence of the ice surface. The paper presents a method of estimating long-term deflection and also presents a method of assessing the effects of dynamic or moving loads.Grounded ice roads require sufficient thickness to spread applied wheel loads and avoid overstressing of the tundra or seabed. A method of assessing the support provided by widely differing subgrade conditions is presented.Construction methods and techniques for ice roads and structures, including the best types of equipment to use, are presented, with photographs. Issues such as snow removal vs. flooding of thick snow are discussed. Durability of the road surface and surface repairs is outlined.During the construction phase of ice structures, the quality control (QC) tasks verify material quantity and material quality as required by the design. An outline of considerations for this task is presented. Failures and anecdotal information related to the design, construction and use of ice roads and structures are presented, with illustrative photographs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Participants expressed a stronger preference for demand-side options than for supply-side ones. They also chose fuel switching (to electricity) and technical energy efficiency measures above more behaviour focused options. Renewable energy options (wind, solar, marine and hydro) were preferred to other low carbon supply options (nuclear power, carbon capture and storage), with offshore wind power more popular than onshore. Nuclear power was the least popular generation option. Acceptability of the government's three proposed scenarios was tested by comparing these scenarios with the research findings. Greatest support was suggested for the two scenarios emphasising business greenness, home energy efficiency, electrification of home heating and travel behaviour. The lowest level of support was demonstrated for the scenario based on significant growth in nuclear power with minimal increases in energy efficiency. Despite issues regarding the representivity of the sampled respondents, the work demonstrates the possibility of using outputs from the tool to assess publically preferred pathways.

The statistical results were quantified from hypothetical oil spills under multiple scenarios, including area affected probability, mean oil slick thickness, and duration of water surface exposed to floating oil. The three sub-indices together with marine area vulnerability are merged to compute the composite index, characterizing the spatial distribution of risk degree. Integral of the index can be used to identify the overall risk from an emission source. The developed model has been successfully applied in comparison to and selection of an appropriate oil port construction location adjacent to a marine protected area for Phoca largha in China. The results highlight the importance of selection of candidates before project construction, since that risk estimation from two adjacent potential sources may turn out to be significantly different regarding hydrodynamic conditions and eco-environmental sensitivity.

During the injection period, the CO2 distribution in the reservoir has been monitored using eight repeated timelapse seismic surveys. This seismic monitoring has shown that the CO2 is visible as thin bright reflectors within the Utsira Formation, interpreted to represent CO2 flooded layers. We show a detailed analysis of the thin CO2 layers, with respect to amplitude and time shift development. For a fixed location that becomes CO2 flooded, the amplitude first increased strongly and a small pull-up of the trough amplitude timing was observed. This response is attributed to interference between top and base of the layer, as long as layer thickness is beneath tuning thickness. This pull-up is an effect induced by wavelet distortion and not related to CO2 in overlying layers. With time the amplitude decreases and the pull-up is reduced to zero. This is attributed to the layer being thick enough for top and base to be separately resolved. Using our time-lapse observations we have estimated this wavelet distortion effect as a function of time of first flood, which has enabled us to correct for it, and estimate time shifts caused by CO2 in overlying layers. Thickness estimates derived from these time shifts complement previous amplitude derived estimates of CO2 thickness.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,0,25,,,2324-8858,2324-8866,,,,,,,,,,"Statoil ASA, Trondheim, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Petr Engn & Appl Geophys, N-7034 Trondheim, NorwayQuad Geometr Norway AS, Trondheim, Norway",Quad Geometr Norway AS,,,2015-12-02,WOS:000364362900006,,

The processing of this information continuously makes humans more vulnerable and prone to lapses and errors. In the wake of such complexity, the construct of situation awareness (SA) and risk perception becomes a core theme for human factors in the operation. Several attempts have been made to develop reliable and valid measures of SA, but the past studies were mainly focused either on self-rating techniques or questionnaire analysis. The reliability and validity of these techniques for real-time application are yet to be established in the petroleum industry. Having this in mind, the current study focuses on the development of a training infrastructure to address the technical and non-technical aspects of training in a holistic manner.This paper presents a training framework based on scenario-based training in combination with different assessment and feedback techniques such as knowledge testing, risk literacy testing, eye-tracking data analysis, verbal response analysis, and questionnaire analysis. The framework comprises of four stages which can provide the participants a swift transition from their pre-training ability and knowledge to post training. To illustrate the working style of this training infrastructure, scenario descriptions are discussed which outlines different operational aspects of drilling. This can provide insight into the holistic approach needed to address the issues of high-reliability organizations (HROs) with improvement in the risk literacy and resilience of the candidates. In addition, the working methodology of eye-tracking analysis and its potential in the context of oil and gas operations training is explained using one of the scenarios constructed.Furthermore, the scenario was executed in which tools and techniques outlined above were implemented. A thorough analysis of the data collected was conducted using statistical methods.

Our idealized method prescribes aerosol concentration, linearly increasing from 2020 to 2100, and thereafter remaining constant until 2200. In the aggressive scenario, the model projects a cooling trend toward 2100 despite warming that persists in the high latitudes. Following SAI termination in 2100, a rapid global warming of 0.35Kyr(-1) is simulated in the subsequent 10years, and the global mean temperature returns to levels close to the reference state, though roughly 0.5K cooler. In contrast to earlier findings, we show a weak response in the terrestrial carbon sink during SAI implementation in the 21st century, which we attribute to nitrogen limitation. The SAI increases the land carbon uptake in the temperate forest-, grassland-, and shrub-dominated regions. The resultant lower temperatures lead to a reduction in the heterotrophic respiration rate and increase soil carbon retention. Changes in precipitation patterns are key drivers for variability in vegetation carbon. Upon SAI termination, the level of vegetation carbon storage returns to the reference case, whereas the soil carbon remains high. The ocean absorbs nearly 10% more carbon in the geoengineered simulation than in the reference simulation, leading to a approximate to 15ppm lower atmospheric CO2 concentration in 2100. The largest enhancement in uptake occurs in the North Atlantic. In both hemispheres' polar regions, SAI delays the sea ice melting and, consequently, export production remains low. In the deep water of North Atlantic, SAI-induced circulation changes accelerate the ocean acidification rate and broaden the affected area.",,,,,,,,,47,4,0,0,12,0,53,,,2169-8953,2169-8961,,,,,,,,,,"Uni Res Climate, Bergen, NorwayBjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, NorwayNorwegian Meteorol Inst, Oslo, Norway",Uni Res Climate,,,2016-03-02,WOS:000370173100001,,

Clearly there is a need for tools that can be used in mitigating the environmental damage incurred by oil accidents. This paper presents a dynamic mapping application for comparing the ecological value of the shoreline of the Gulf of Finland to guide decisions on where to lay oil booms after an oil spill accident. The maps were required to combine conservational value of different species occurrences, the estimated level of oil exposure, the estimated recovery potential of the occurrences following the accident, and the efficiency of oil booms to safeguard the species inhabiting the occurrences. The mapping was tested in representative cases. The results indicate that the ranking of neighbouring shoreline streches changes depending on weather conditions and on choices made in developing the significance criteria. To the authors knowledge this work represents a unique effort in combining biological and geospatial expertise to provide decision support for oil combating. Such support is essential should ecological values truly be included in oil combating planning and management. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Local petroleum production contributes billions of dollars per year to the nations economy. Production so far is from just one area (Taranaki Basin), but our vast territory contains at least 17 other sedimentary basins that are largely unexplored for petroleum. A large discovery anywhere would dramatically improve our economic fortunes.The full extent of our natural petroleum endowment is unknown. Petroleum resides deep below the surface, making the search for it cryptic and complex. This research programme will provide high-quality technical information on potential subsurface petroleum habitats to aid the exploration effort. The overall aim is to synthesise a huge wealth of existing data, information and knowledge to produce a nationally-significant baseline reference dataset that summarises in one place, for the first time, the current understanding of our geologically complex, primarily offshore petroleum basins. The primary output will be a digital atlas comprising a series of maps and metadata of all key geological components for petroleum accumulation in NZ basins, in readily accessible Geographic Information System (GIS) format. Discrete data types (e.g. sediment thickness, paleogeography, source and reservoir rock distribution, etc.) will be delivered as separate map layers. Outputs will be released via GNS Sciences Petroleum Basin Explorer (PBE) web server and as data packs.Interpretations will be calibrated with respect to previous exploration drilling successes and failures. Areas of highest prospectivity and areas with poor data control or availability will be identified. The map set will allow new investors to quickly appraise NZs exploration potential and will provide a springboard for developing new exploration concepts and strategic targeting of areas with the most potential in the increasingly sophisticated search for new petroleum reserves.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,C05X1406,,,,,,,,Institute of Geological & Nuclear Sciences Limited - Trading as GNS Science,Institute of Geological & Nuclear Sciences Limited - Trading as GNS Science,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:16297554,,

The spill occurred when two cargo ships collided about two miles away from the Chennai shoreline. The accident released about 75 metric tons of heavy fuel oil into the Bay of Bengal. This case study provides field observations and laboratory characterization data for this oil spill accident. Our field observations show that the seawalls and groins, which were installed along the Chennai shoreline to manage coastal erosion problems, played a significant role in controlling the oil deposition patterns. A large amount of oil was trapped within the relatively stagnant zone near the seawall-groin intersection region. The initial cleanup efforts used manual methods to skim the trapped oil and these efforts indeed helped recover large amount of oil. Our laboratory data show that the Chennai oil spill residues have unique fingerprints of hopanes and steranes which can be used to track the spill. Our weathering experiments show that volatilization processes should have played a significant role in degrading the oil during initial hours. The characterization data show that the source oil contained about 503,000 mg/kg of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and 17,586 mg/kg of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The field samples collected 6 and 62 days after the spill contained about 71,000 and 28,000 mg/kg of TPH and 4854 and 4016 mg/kg of total PAHs, respectively. The field samples had a relatively large percentage of heavy PAHs, and most of these PAHs are highly toxic compounds that are difficult to weather and their long-term effects on coastal ecosystems are largely unknown. Therefore, more detailed studies are needed to monitor and track the long term environmental impacts of the Chennai oil spill residues on the Bay of Bengal coastal ecosystem. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It has direct applications such as wind farm prospective location or long-term power generation prediction in wind-based energy facilities. The problem's objective is to select the best set of N measuring points (i.e. N representative points), in such a way that a wind power error reconstruction measure is minimized, considering a monthly average wind power field. In order to solve this problem, we use a novel meta-heuristic algorithm, the Coral Reefs Optimization with Substrate Layer, which is an evolutionary-type method able to combine different search procedures within a single population. The CRO-SL is hybridized with the Analogue Method as wind power reconstruction method, to identify the most representative points for the wind field. The proposed approach has been tested in the reconstruction of monthly average wind power fields in Europe, from reanalysis data (ERA-Interim reanalysis). The method exhibits strong performance as evidenced from the experiments carried out. The solutions obtained show that the more significant measuring points are mainly located over the Atlantic ocean, which is consistent with the wind speed climatology of the Northern hemisphere mid-latitudes. We have also analyzed the set of least representative points to reconstruct the wind power field (less informative points for whole reconstruction of the field), obtaining points mainly located at the North of Scandinavia (which may be associated with the circumpolar circulation), and some points in the Eastern Mediterranean, which seem to be related to the Etesian winds. Reconstructions at seasonal scales show similar results, which provides confidence on the robustness of the proposed method.

The main problems with traditional approaches concern the often-times high similarities of SiO2 raw materials (i.e. chert and flint) on different scales due to similar genetic conditions and higher intra-than inter-source variation. Conventional chert and flint provenance studies chiefly concentrate on visual, petrographic or geochemical investigations. Hence, attempts to generate characteristic fingerprints of particular chert raw materials were in most cases unsatisfying. Here we show that the Multi Layered Chert Sourcing Approach (MLA) achieves a clear differentiation between primary sources of Scandinavian flint. The MLA combines visual comparative studies, stereo-microscopic analyses of microfossil inclusions, geochemical trace element analyses applying LA-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) and statistical analyses through CODA (Compositional Data Analysis). For archaeologists, provenance studies are the gateway to advance interpretations of economic behavior expressed in resource management strategies entailing the procurement, use and distribution of lithic raw materials. We demonstrate the relevance of our results for archaeological materials in a case study in which we were able to differentiate between Scandinavian flint sources and establish the provenance of historic ballast flint from a shipwreck found near Kristiansand close to the shore of southern Norway from a beach source in Northern Jutland, the Vigso Bay.",,,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,2,0,31,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Austrian Acad Sci, OREA Inst, Vienna, AustriaUniv Texas Austin, Dept Anthropol, Austin, TX 78712 USAKarl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Earth Sci, NAWI Graz Geoctr, Graz, AustriaVienna Univ Technol, Inst Stat & Math Methods Econ, Vienna, AustriaNorwegian Maritime Museum, Oslo, NorwayUniv Vienna, Inst Prehist & Hist Archaeol, Vienna, AustriaCtr Balt & Scandinavian Archaeol, Schleswig, GermanyUniv Highlands & Isl, Inst Nord Studies, Kirkwall, Orkney, Scotland",Norwegian Maritime MuseumCtr Balt & Scandinavian Archaeol,,,2018-09-05,WOS:000441090300013,30089119,

B.P. (18,000 years before present) atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations varied in a parallel direction to surface temperature over East Antarctica. This variation implicates that paleoclimate induced a change of the carbon cycle at the Earth's surface. Here the corresponding change of terrestrial carbon storage is estimated. The decrease of the surface temperature over land and the extent of the ice sheet on land of the Northern Hemisphere led to a reduction of terrestrial carbon storage of 363-544 GtC (1 GtC = 10(15) g carbon), about 2 or 3 fold that of CO2-C in the atmosphere. The extension of vegetation on new land formed by the drop of sea level appears to have been small. Therefore the decrease carbon storage in the atmosphere and on land corresponds to a net carbon transfer to the oceans of about 533-714 GtC.At the same time, the decrease of 46% in atmospheric CH4 concentration can be attributed to a reduction in the emissions of continental sources. A latitudinal distribution of these emissions has been calculated. It is shown that one of the main reductions in the CH4 emissions took place at boreal latitudes parallel with the extent of ice sheet over land, and amounts to about 37 Tg CH4-C yr(-1) (1 Tg CH4-C yr(-1) = 10(12) g CH4-C per year). The second reduction, in South America, with the lowering of surface temperature and possibly rainfall, accounts for an other 17 Tg CH4-C yr(-1). The decrease in atmospheric CH4 level can also be partly attributed to an increase of the OH level in atmospheric air, about 20% at a maximum.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0169-8095,1873-2895,,,,,,,,,,"Lab Aerol, F-31062 Toulouse, France",,,,1994-04-01,WOS:000208525900002,,

A sustainable and comprehensive system for psychosocial risk management should ideally be embedded in organisational operations and processes. One way of integrating psychosocial risk management into a larger process is to link it to an organisation's strategy using familiar concepts or techniques such as performance indicators. The purpose of this article is to describe the development of a Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) indicator for psychosocial risk in the oil and gas industry. The development process included a number of interrelated steps utilising the evidence-based practice model. This has resulted in the establishment of a proactive exposure indicator automatically published in the internal organisational performance management system of the organisation. Having an indicator fully adopted into the existing management system and linked to the larger HSE risk management process represents a powerful tool in managing psychosocial risk. The paper also addresses challenges encountered in the process and lessons learnt that can be useful for other organisations and the industry as a whole. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects on litter decomposition rates were postulated to explain some of the nutritional effects of factors such as tree species, forest harvesting and fertilization. However, the accumulated experimental evidence indicates that litter decomposition rates do not mediate these responses. Many studies have reported litter mass loss becoming extremely slow at values considerably below 100%, indicating that early decay rates may not accurately foreshadow the entire decay process. Exclusion of soil faunal activities from current measurements of decomposition rates seriously reduces the likelihood that we are properly modeling decomposition. Finally, the use of regression and correlation analyses to determine which climate or initial litter quality factors control decay rate has led to many unwarranted and potentially misleading conclusions. These concerns are illustrated with examples from a suite of litter decomposition studies in British Columbia, Canada. Insights into nutrient cycling and carbon storage in ecosystems are more likely to arise from measuring the mass and nutrient content of annual litter input and determining the maximum decomposition limit and nutrient content at that stage, than by measuring early rates of decay. Improved predictions of relative decay rates of plant litters are likely to arise from a holistic approach based on plant life attributes rather than correlations based on individual initial litter chemistry parameters. Finally, a better understanding of the fate of faecal material of soil fauna is necessary before we can accurately predict and model litter decomposition. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A growing number of offshore helicopter operations are to moving helidecks, which include large vessels such as FPSOs, drill ships, and semi-submersibles, as well as smaller service vessels. Landing a helicopter on a moving helideck presents additional challenges to those faced on fixed helidecks, not only at the point of touchdown but also for the entire period the helicopter remains on the helideck. The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), on behalf of the joint CAA/industry Helicopter Safety Research Management Committee has led a comprehensive programme of research over a number of years, aimed at improving the operational safety of helicopters landing on moving helidecks. The work focused on the aspect of the stability of helicopters once landed on a moving helideck, this being the main source of in-service incidents and accidents as evidenced in the Mandatory Occurrence Reports. The project culminated in the development of a new standard for Helideck Monitoring Systems (HMS), which was published by the Helideck Certification Agency in April 2018 with an implementation compliance date of 31 March 2021. Operations to moving helidecks not equipped with HMS meeting the new standard will be restricted to stable deck conditions from this date. The research underpinning the new standard is presented in two papers. This paper (Part A), presents the analytical approach that has been developed to model the Reserve of Stability (ROS) for all modes of failure of a helicopter on a moving offshore helideck. The analytical model covers all modes of on-deck failure (roll-over and sliding), for any nose wheel tricycle undercarriage helicopter. The mathematical expressions that have been derived are remarkably simple, physically intuitive, and make the relative contribution of all the destabilising factors easy to understand and assess. These analytical expressions can be used to calculate the ROS of any helicopter in real time, as well as for calculating an envelope of safe operating limits. This approach has many advantages compared to conventional 'black box' modelling methods. The main advantage is that it simplifies the modelling of the destabilising effect of helideck motion and allows the most salient parameters governing on-deck ROS to be defined, namely the Measure of Motion Severity, the instantaneous wind speed as the Measure of Wind Severity, and the wind direction relative to the helicopter (Relative Wind Direction). The main rotor lift generated during the time the helicopter remains on-deck (at Minimum Pitch on Ground, MPOG) has been one of the most important unknowns that this research programme has sought to address. An empirical model for estimating the lift at MPOG has been developed, based on experimental and field data. Practical methods for quantifying fuselage wind drag and the vertical position of the centre of gravity were also developed, which allow different helicopter types to be assessed without recourse to helicopter Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) proprietary information or models. Finally, a comparison and evaluation of the model against dedicated field trial measurements is presented, together with a discussion of the modelling strengths and weaknesses, and recommendations for further work.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0001-9240,2059-6464,,,,,,,,,,"Air Ops Safety Ltd, Surbiton, EnglandCivil Aviat Author, London, England",Air Ops Safety LtdCivil Aviat Author,,,2020-09-08,WOS:000562455000001,,

Assessments of the pitting and crevice corrosion for different alloys were carried out through electrochemical measurements and surface characterizations. The results showed that, the order of the pitting corrosion resistance of five alloys in marine environment was: 825 Ni-based alloy similar to 2507 super duplex stainless steel > 2205 duplex stainless steel similar to 317L similar to 316L, while the crevice corrosion resistance was: 825 Ni-based alloy similar to 2507 super duplex stainless steel > 2205 duplex stainless steel > 317L > 316L.

In crevice corrosion samples, the most severe corrosion was observed in the crevice edge area.

Recent advancements in harvesting shale oil have slowed the race to define and develop the offshore Arctic energy resources, but the need to continue the planning and preparations for production is still present.The prevention of accumulation or melting of snow and ice on outdoor stairs, handrails, walkways, and other exposed and uninsulated surfaces represents growing interest for Electrical Heat Trace (EHT) technology. For harsh Arctic environments, EHT is being installed on, in, and/or under surfaces to reduce unsafe icing conditions during normal operations or during emergency conditions. This is particularly important for safety systems and those surfaces associated with emergency personnel evacuation.A paper on this topic [4] was presented at the 2012 IEEE/IAS-PCIC Conference in New Orleans, LA, USA, and has subsequently been published in IEEE Transactions [4]. This is one of the few independent articles published on this topic, but is not thought to be impacting any updates in philosophies and progress on the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Polar Code. The latter are relevant to a wide range of design and operational matters of ships operating in polar regions. This will affect the oil & gas companies which may consider operations in polar regions and particularly the electrical engineers involved in their Marine, Operations and Transportation Divisions.Classification societies have guidelines and prescriptive requirements for winterization but there exist vast and unique range of systems, arrangements, environmental conditions, and operational profiles which often don't make the prescriptive requirement applicable to many situations.The IEEE 45.8 Recommended Practice for Electrical Installations on Shipboard - Cable Systems will reference EHT for heating pipes, tanks, and instrumentation on-board ocean-going vessels. The globally recognized ANSI/IEEE 515 and IEC 60079-30 standards address traditional freeze protection and temperature maintenance applications on-board tankers and Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading (FPSO) facilities, which are quite often hazardous locations.

Emerging markets for carbon emission offsets may offer developing nations needed incentives for reforestation, rehabilitation, and avoided deforestation. However, relatively little empirical data exists regarding carbon storage in African tropical forests, particularly for those in arid or semi-arid regions. Kenya's 416 km(2) Arabuko-Sokoke Forest (ASF) is the largest remaining fragment of East African coastal dry forest and is considered a global biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al. 2000), but has been significantly altered by past commercial logging and ongoing extraction. Forest carbon storage for ASF was estimated using allometric equations for tree biomass, destructive techniques for litter and herbaceous vegetation biomass, and spectroscopy for soils. Satellite imagery was used to assess land cover changes from 1992 to 2004. Forest and thicket types (Cynometra webberi dominated, Brachystegia spiciformis dominated, and mixed species forest) had carbon densities ranging from 58 to 94 Mg C/ha. The ASF area supported a 2.8-3.0 Tg C carbon stock. Although total forested area in ASF did not change over the analyzed time period, ongoing disturbances, quantified by the basal area of cut tree stumps per sample plot, correlated with decreased carbon densities. Madunguni Forest, an adjoining forest patch, lost 86% of its forest cover and at least 76% of its terrestrial carbon stock in the time period. Improved management of wood harvesting in ASF and rehabilitation of Madunguni Forest could substantially increase terrestrial carbon sequestration in the region.",,,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,24,2,40,,,0167-6369,1573-2959,,,,,,,,,,"Brown Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, CEPF, Durban, South Africa",Brown Univ,,,2008-07-01,WOS:000256471500008,17882526,

To improve understanding of the influence of these factors on forest carbon stocks and flux in the western United States, federal inventory data and supplemental field measurements at additional plots were used to estimate several important components of the carbon balance in forests in Oregon and Northern California during the 1990s. Species-and ecoregion-specific allometric equations were used to estimate live and dead biomass stores, net primary productivity (NPP), and mortality. In the semiarid East Cascades and mesic Coast Range, mean total biomass was 8 and 24 kg C/m(2), and mean NPP was 0.30 and 0.78 kg C.m(-2).yr(-1), respectively. Maximum NPP and dead biomass stores were most influenced by climate, whereas maximum live biomass stores and mortality were most influenced by forest type. Within ecoregions, mean live and dead biomass were usually higher on public lands, primarily because of the younger age class distribution on private lands. Decrease in NPP with age was not general across ecoregions, with no marked decline in old stands (>200 years old) in some ecoregions. In the absence of stand-replacing disturbance, total landscape carbon stocks could theoretically increase from 3.2 +/- 0.34 Pg C to 5.9 +/- 1.34 Pg C (a 46% increase) if forests were managed for maximum carbon storage.

In this study, a large number of hypothetical oil spills with an idealized, passive tracer are simulated. From the tracer distributions, statistical measures are calculated to optimize the quantity of tracer from a spill that would stay at sea as long as possible. Increased time may permit action to be taken against the spill before the oil reaches environmentally vulnerable coastal zones. The statistical measures are used to calculate maritime routes with maximum probability that an oil spill will stay at sea as long as possible. Under these assumptions, ships should follow routes that are located south of Bornholm instead of the northern routes in use currently. Our results suggest that the location of the optimal maritime routes depends on the season, although interannual variability is too large to identify statistically significant changes.

The current approach to assessing the number and distribution of birds at sea is transect-surveys conducted by trained individuals in boats or planes, or analysis of imagery collected from aerial surveys. These methods can be costly and pose safety concerns so that observation times are limited to daylight hours and fair weather. We propose an alternative method based on analysis of thermal video that could be recorded autonomously. We present a framework for building models to classify birds and bats and their associated behaviors from their flight tracks. As an example, we developed a discriminant model for theoretical flight paths and applied it to data (N = 64 tracks) extracted from 5-minute video clips. The agreement between model- and observer-classified path types was initially only 41%, but it increased to 73% when small-scale jitter was censored and the number of different path types was reduced. Classification of 46 tracks of bats, swallows, gulls, and terns on average was 82% accurate, based on a jackknife cross-validation. Model classification of gulls and swallows (N 18) was on average 73% and 85% correct, respectively. Model classification of bats and terns (N = 4 and 2, respectively) was 94% and 91% correct, respectively; however, the variance associated with the tracks from these targets is poorly estimated. The models developed here should be considered preliminary because they are based on a small data set both in terms of the numbers of species and the identified flight tracks. Future classification models could be improved if the distance between the camera and the target was known. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Soil warming has resulted in carbon losses from the soil and stimulated carbon gains in the woody tissue of trees. The warming-enhanced decay of soil organic matter also released enough additional inorganic nitrogen into the soil solution to support the observed increases in plant carbon storage. Although soil warming has resulted in a cumulative net loss of carbon from a New England forest relative to a control area over the 7-y study, the annual net losses generally decreased over time as plant carbon storage increased. In the seventh year, warming-induced soil carbon losses were almost totally compensated for by plant carbon gains in response to warming. We attribute the plant gains primarily to warming-induced increases in nitrogen availability.

East Asian, nevertheless, contributed to giving aid to people drifted in the late Chosun Period. The 18th to 19th Century, some Chinese were washed up on the shore of the west sea of Chosun. Why did they sail on the sea and drift our ashore? A total of 138 cases of Chinese drift have been found in the data published by the central government in the late Chosun Period. This allowed this study to review the time of its occurrence, their ports of origin, the places of drifting, the purpose of the voyage, and shipping goods and how the stance of Chosun Period on the Qing Dynasty had been established and developed.In 17th Century, China allowed their people to sail abroad, which made coastal residents open up coastal routes or go abroad in the Kanghe era (the period of King Kanghe’s reign 1661~1722). At that time, the relations between Chosun and Qing were sharply downsized in terms of diplomatic courtesy or form from past years, but they still claimed to stand for vertical relations to the problems pending between Chosun and Qing like trade, a border violation, people drifted, and a frontier. After King Ongjung succeeded to the throne, the relations between Chosun and Qing became stable, intellectuals of Chosun began to recognize the Qing Dynasty in reality, and normal diplomatic relations on the problems of people drift between Chosun and Qing were established. King Gunryung who succeeded to the throne following King Kanghe and King Ongjung ruled over the largest territory in the history of China thanks to the stable politic basis and ample economics. Especially, King Gunryung took action to give aid to the people drift, which had a considerable impact on activities on the sea at home and abroad. This was a time when the number of accidents of Chinese drift tripled than before.After Chinese had washed up on the shore of Chosun, the officials of Bibyunsa gave aid to them, but, on the other hand, collected information at home and abroad. Munjunbyuldan is a document which recorded dialogues between the officials of Chosun and Chinese drift. It includes a wide range of subjects like names, residential places, ports of origin, and places of drifting of people drift, shipping goods, situation of the crops, kinds of local produce, size of fields, taxation, distance between regions, local officials, size of a drifted ship, adjunctive islands, the art of fishing, navigation, pirates, and so on. The residents in the places of drifting who the Chinese met with were quite different from the officials of Bibyunsa. They considered the Chinese drift sailors rescued from the accidents on the sea rather than looked out for them. At last, in the 19th century, Chinese trespassed on our country under pretense of fishing and had access not only to the area of sea around Chosun but to even inland in the name of ‘people drift’.",,,,"표류는 해상에서 발생한 조난사고이지만, 타국의 경계를 침범한 행위다. 그럼에도 불구하고 조선후기 동아시아 사람들은 표류민을 구휼하는데 지원을 아끼지 않았다. 18~19세기 중국인들이 조선의 서해해역에 표류해왔다. 조선후기 중앙정부에서 간행한 관찬자료에서 총 138건의 중국인 표류사건을 검출하였다. 이를 통해 중국인 표류사고의 발생시기, 출항지와 표착지점, 항해목적과 선적화물, 그리고 표류민 문제와 관련하여 조선의 對淸關係가 어떻게 변화되어갔는가를 검토하였다.17세기 중국이 자국민의 海外渡航을 허용하자, 康熙年間(재위 1661~ 1722)에 연해지역 주민들이 연안항로를 개척하거나 해외로 진출하였다. 이 시기의 朝淸關係는 과거에 비해 의례나 형식면에서 대폭 축소되었으나, 양국 간의 현안문제인 交易･越境･漂民･疆界 등에 대해서는 여전히 수직관계를 표방하였다. 뒤이어 雍正帝(재위 1722~1735)가 등극하면서 조청관계는 안정되고, 조선의 지식인들도 청조를 현실적으로 인정하기 시작하였다. 이 때 조청 간의 표류민 문제에 대한 정상적인 외교관계가 성립되었다. 강희~옹정제의 뒤를 이어 등극한 乾隆帝(재위 1736~1795)는 안정된 정치와 풍부한 재정을 기반으로 중국 역사상 최대 영역을 통치하였다. 특히 건륭제는 동아시아 표류민에 대한 구호 조처를 단행하여 중국인의 해상활동에 많은 영향을 주었으며, 그에 비례하여 표류사고는 전대에 비해 3배로 증가하였다.중국인이 조선 해역으로 표류해오자, 비변사 관원들은 표도민을 구휼하는 한편 국내외 정보를 수집하였다. 조선의 관원과 중국인 표류민 간의 대화를 기록한 문건이 「問情別單」 이다. 수록 내용은 표류인의 성명, 거주지, 신분, 출항지, 목적지, 선적물품, 농사의 작황, 토산물, 전답, 세금, 지역 간의 거리, 지방관원, 표류선의 규모, 부속도서, 어로기술, 항해술, 海賊 등에 이르기까지 다양하다. 그러나 중국 표류인들이 만난 표착지점 주민들은 비변사 관원들과 사뭇 달랐다. 그들은 중국 표류민을 異國人으로 경계하기보다 해난사고에서 살아서 돌아온 뱃사람으로 인식하였다. 급기야 19세기에 이르면 중국인들은 고기잡이를 핑계 삼아 우리나라 해역을 넘나들었고, ‘표류민’이라는 이름으로 조선의 내륙 깊숙한 곳까지 출입하였다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1229-3687,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-02-22,KJD:ART001946912,,

We examined forest dynamics in relation to disturbance history, topography and soil nutrients based on partial re-census of the 50-ha Wanang Forest Dynamics Plot in Papua New Guinea. The plot is relatively high in cations and phosphorus but low in nitrogen. Soil nutrients and topography accounted for 29% of variation in species composition but only 4% of variation in basal area. There were few areas of high biomass and most of the forest was comprised of small-diameter stems. Approximately 18% of the forest was less than 30 y old and the annual tree mortality rate of nearly 4% was higher than in other tropical forests in South-East Asia and the neotropics. These results support the reputation of New Guinea's forests as highly dynamic, with frequent natural disturbance.

The marine environment of Japan Sea is of great importance in these days partly by damping of radio active wastes or by oil spill caused by wreck of an oil tanker. Direct measurements of currents are requisite for circulation study. Moored current meters, of Eulerian measurement, are affected by topographic control, especially at deep layrs. On the other hand, tracking of neutral floats, of Lagrangian measurement, is most effective to show the transport of sea water.

The role of water in the cavity and channel formed behind the pipe during the lateral penetration on drag force is successfully simulated. Numerical simulations for varying depths of the pipe explain the change in soil failure mechanisms in which the channel behind the pipe and bermplay a significant role, especially at shallow depths.

Mean annual temperatures have warmed by almost 1[degree]C (with the most warming in winter) since AD 1900, but with substantial year-to-year fluctuations. Frost frequency has declined through most of the country since the middle of the 20th century, although only a small net warming (c. 0.3[degree]C) has occurred. This study used New Zealand and international literature to review the potential effects of increasing climate change and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration on indigenous terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity in New Zealand. It discusses the implications of climate change for the Department of Conservation (DOC) and for national policy, and recommends key areas for management and research, and priorities for policy development. The main recommendations for management are provision for managed adaptation to landward migration of coastal ecosystems with sea-level rise; establishing minimum flows in and riparian vegetation around streams and springs; monitoring key ecosystems (coastal, dry lowland and alpine); and survelliance of biotic distributions, particularly exotic weeds and invertebrates with known potential for spread under a warming climate. It is not considered necessary to have any active planning for climate-driven species range changes or fluctuations in abundance. While during the next 50 years climate change itself is a significant risk to biodiversity, in the short term the risks associated with combating climate change (through carbon sequestration, carbon-neutral energy development, irrigation and land use intensification) are greater. exotic forestry for carbon capture, and more hydroelectric installations and water abstraction, carry the greatest potential risk to biodiversity. Therefore, careful consideration must be given to minimise these; in particular, to wilding spread from plantations and disruption of rivers used for hydroelectric power generation.

Presence of clean feces resulted in higher degradation of aromatic oil compounds, but lower degradation of n-alkanes. Presence of oil-containing feces resulted in higher degradation of n-alkanes. The effect of clean feces on aromatic compounds are suggested to be due to higher concentrations of nutrients in the seawater where aromatic degradation takes place, while the lower degradation of n-alkanes are suggested to be due to a preference by bacteria for feces over these compounds.

Forecasting the maintenance costs based on technical characteristics (e.g. reliability and maintainability) and considering the operational environment, as well as including uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo simulation, provide more trustworthy information in the decision-making process.Practical implications - There are few data and little experience available regarding the operation of offshore oil and gas production systems in the Arctic region. Using the available data collected from similar systems, but in a different operational environment, may result in uncertain or incorrect analysis results. Hence, the method that is used for maintenance cost analysis must be able to quantify the effect of the operating environment on the system reliability and maintainability as well as to quantify the uncertainty.Originality/value - The paper presents a statistical approach that will be useful in predicting maintenance cost considering the lack of appropriate reliability data from equipment operated in Arctic conditions.

They contain about 455 Gt of carbon, almost equivalent to the carbon stored in all of the living things on the surface of the planet, and representing around 25% of all the soil carbon on earth. These bogs are a sink for atmospheric carbon and their carbon uptake accounts for about 12% of current human emissions. They vary considerably in their form and structure and are an important resource for scientific research, including the study of past environments and climate change, and they are also valuable in environmental education. They are low in biodiversity, but their fauna and flora are distinctive and many groups are confined to this habitat. For all these reasons, the future conservation of peatlands is a matter for concern. Threats to peatlands come from direct human exploitation in the form of peat harvesting for energy and horticulture, and drainage for forestry. Rising environmental awareness should control both of these processes in the western world, but continued northern peatland losses are likely locally, especially in Asia. Peatland drainage for forestry or agriculture will result in losses of carbon to the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse effect. Human population pressures, industrialization and urbanization are unlikely to have an important direct and immediate influence in the boreal zone. Fragmentation of the habitat is not an important consideration because bogs are by their very nature 'island' habitats. Acidification by aerial pollution may be a local problem close to sources, but the habitat is naturally acid and should not be severely affected, The input of aerial nutrients, however, particularly nitrogen, could have widespread impact on bogs, enhancing their productivity and altering their vegetation composition. The physical rehabilitation of bogs damaged by human activities presents many problems, particularly relating to the re-establishment of peat structure and vegetation, but the process can result in the re-formation of a carbon sink so it is worth the effort. Climate change is the most important consideration in its impact on bogs. Higher temperature (especially if accompanied by raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and increased nitrate deposition) will enhance productivity, but will also result in faster decomposition rates. The outcome of these opposing factors for peat formation will ultimately depend on the future pattern of precipitation. If, as seems most likely, summer conditions become warmer and drier in continental regions and winters become milder and wetter, the summer drought could cause peat loss and bog contraction. An excess of decomposition will lead to bogs becoming a carbon source and thus a positive feedback in global warming. Emissions of methane and nitrous oxide would add to the greenhouse gas problem, but likely oxidation of methane and low N2O production may well mean that this impact will not prove to be significant. Tree invasion of bogs as a consequence of summer drought could locally lead to increased water loss through transpiration, and higher heat absorption through albedo change. This will enhance the drying effect on the bog surface. Oceanic mires will be less severely affected if the expected increase in precipitation takes place in these regions. The most important overall factor in determining the future of the northern bogs is likely to be the quantity and pattern (both spatially and temporally) of future precipitation in the zone.",,,,,,,,,188,1,0,0,141,2,225,,,0376-8929,1469-4387,,,,,,,,,,"Kings Coll London, Div Life Sci, London SE1 9NN, England",,,,2002-03-01,WOS:000175924000002,,

Reconstructing past variations in seawater carbonate ion concentration (a major component of alkalinity) enables quantification of the relative roles of different oceanic CO2 storage mechanisms and also places constraints on the timing, magnitude, and location of subsequent deep ocean ventilation. Here, we present a record of deep-water inorganic carbon chemistry since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; similar to 19-23 ka BP), derived from sediment core RR0503-83 raised from 1627 m in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty. The core site lies within the upper limit of southern-sourced Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), just below the lower boundary of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). We reconstruct past changes in bottom water inorganic carbon chemistry from the trace element and stable isotopic composition of calcite shells of the epibenthic foraminifer Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi. A record of Delta CO32- (Delta CO32- = [CO32-](in situ) - [CO32-](saturation)) derived from the foraminiferal boron to calcium ratio (B/Ca) provides evidence for greater ice-age storage of respired CO2 and reveals abrupt deglacial shifts in [CO32-](in situ) of up to 30 mu mol/kg (5 times larger than the difference between average LGM and Holocene values). The rapidity of these changes suggests the influence of changing water mass structure and atmospheric circulation in addition to a decrease in CO2 content of interior waters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Efficient contingency management in responding to oil spills is critically important. Strategic priorities in contingency management highly depend upon the importance attributed to different economic and ecological resources such as beaches or birds. Due to the lack of a market for natural resources in the real world, these resources cannot be directly measured in monetary terms. This increases the risk that natural resources and their services are neglected in contingency decision making. This paper evaluates these natural resources in a hypothetical market by using the methodology of stated choice experiments.

Grains containing Oil Inclusions (GOI (TM)) technique, well logging, and formation testing together indicate that the present-day gas condensate layer has evolved from a paleo-oil layer. Biomarkers from oil inclusions indicate that these paleo-oils were generated from coal measures at a moderate maturity level. Based on organic macerals, elemental ratios of kerogens, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, and results from gold-tube pyrolysis experiments, the coal measures are evaluated as source rocks prone to gas generation and capable of oil formation at moderate levels of maturity. This maturity level coincides with present-day condensate maturities determined from a series of molecular maturity ratios (vitrinite reflectance similar to 0.7-1.0% R-o). Biomarkers related to specific sources suggest that the condensates are also coal-derived. These observations suggest that the condensates are derived from secondary alteration following paleo-oil accumulation, rather than being related to the thermal degradation of resin-rich organic matter at a low maturity level, or the thermal cracking of kerogen at a high maturity level.Some condensates are characterized by a significant loss of n-alkanes with low carbon numbers and relatively high toluene/n-heptane (Tol/nC(7)) ratios. This indicates that the paleo-oil reservoirs have been subjected to varying degrees of gas washing, which resulted in condensate formation, as opposed to the process of oil cracking under high temperatures. Subsequent interactions between gas and paleo-oils resulted in oil inclusions showing fluorescence varying from near-yellow to blue. Variable vapor volume fractions measured in the same oil assemblage are the result of two-phase trapping of oil and gas. The widely observed presence of bitumen (asphaltene) in the reservoir pores and bitumen-bearing oil inclusions is considered to be due to gas deasphalting.Homogenization temperatures (Th) of associated aqueous inclusions and burial-thermal curves suggest that the initial paleo-oil reservoirs formed in the late Miocene. Excess gas, composed of local mature gas and heterochthonous high-to over-mature gas, migrated into the paleo-oil reservoirs later, in the Quaternary. This process not only resulted in the formation of condensates, but also led to vertical differentiation of density and wax content in the reservoirs.",,,,,,,,,16,2,0,0,1,0,17,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Geosci, Key Lab Tecton & Petr Resource, Educ Minist, Wuhan, Peoples R ChinaUniv Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Radiogen Isotope Facil RIF, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaUniv Texas Austin, Bur Econ Geol, Austin, TX USACNOOC Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China",,,,2020-06-18,WOS:000537736900043,,

Defense of shorelines by protection and restoration of wetlands has been invoked as a win-win strategy for humans and nature, yet evidence from field experiments supporting the wetland protection function is uncommon, as is the understanding of its context dependency. Here we provide evidence from field manipulations showing that the loss of wetland vegetation, regardless of disturbance size, increases the rate of erosion on wave-stressed shorelines. Vegetation removal (simulated disturbance) along the edge of salt marshes reveals that loss of wetland plants elevates the rate of lateral erosion and that extensive root systems, rather than aboveground biomass, are primarily responsible for protection against edge erosion in marshes. Meta-analysis further shows that disturbances that generate plant dieoff on salt marsh edges generally hasten edge erosion in coastal marshes and that the erosion protection function of wetlands relates more to lateral than vertical edge-erosional processes and is positively correlated with the amount of below-ground plant biomass lost. Collectively, our findings substantiate a coastal protection paradigm that incorporates preservation of shoreline vegetation, illuminate key context dependencies in this theory, and highlight local disturbances (e.g., oil spills) that kill wetland plants as agents that can accelerate coastal erosion.",,,,,,,,,43,2,0,0,29,0,49,,,0960-9822,1879-0445,,,,,,,,,,"Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Div Marine Sci & Conservat, 135 Duke Marine Lab Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USAUniv Florida, Dept Environm Engn Sci, POB 116580, Gainesville, FL 32611 USAVirginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, POB 1346,1375 Greate Rd, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USAUNMdP, CONICET, IIMyC, CC1260, RA-7600 Mar Del Plata, ArgentinaOld Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USAUniv Florida, Whitney Lab Marine Sci, St Augustine, FL 32080 USAUS Army Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Wetlands & Coastal Ecol Branch, Vicksburg, MS 39180 USARoyal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Estuarine & Delta Syst, POB 140, NL-4400 AC Yerseke, NetherlandsUniv Utrecht, POB 140, NL-4400 AC Yerseke, NetherlandsUniv Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci GELIFES, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands",,,,2019-06-24,WOS:000470902000039,31130456,

The Gippsland Basin has been producing hydrocarbons since the 1960s and the depletion and decommissioning of some of the major oil fields is likely to coincide with the need for storage of anticipated CO2 emissions of up to 50 million tonnes annually for a 40 year injection period (Gibson-Poole et al., 2006). This will necessitate several individual storage sites to be used both sequentially and simultaneously, but timed such that existing hydrocarbon assets will not be compromised.Potential injection targets lie within the interbedded sandstones of the Upper Latrobe Group, regionally sealed by the Lakes Entrance Formation (Gibson-Poole, et al., 2006). A hydrodynamic evaluation of the Upper Latrobe Aquifer System (the Latrobe Group) mapped the hydraulic head distribution of the virgin formation water flow system and the impact on that system of the extraction of large volumes of gas and oil (Hatton et al., 2004; Underschultz and Johnson, 2005). They determined that offshore oil and gas production have resulted in significant, although short-term (tens to hundreds of years) alteration of the formation water flow system.This paper outlines a study investigating whether the local hydraulic gradients induced by pressure depletion in the vicinity of hydrocarbon production are sufficient to alter the buoyancy driven migration of injected CO2. The methodology developed by Hubbert (1953) to determine the ability of geologic structures to hold hydrocarbons under varying hydrodynamic conditions was applied to CO2 storage. An average density of injected CO2 calculated from in-situ pressure and temperature conditions in the Latrobe aquifer was applied to both virgin and production affected hydrogeological environments. The results suggest that the location of reservoir spill points and the migration direction of CO2 in the Latrobe aquifer would change continually due to the transient nature of the production impact on the formation water flow system. Therefore, it is not sufficient to calculate a static volume available for CO2 storage within structural closures. The production lifetime of and the potential pressure interference between petroleum fields has to be taken into account when selecting sites for CO2 geological storage.

After this remediation event in 2010, above-ground litter production increased by 2.7 times of production levels in 2007-2011. Biomass of the leaf and reproductive tissues of several species increased; wood litter was minimal and did not change during this period. Root production decreased in 2010 but subsequently returned to pre-remediation values in 2011. Both litter and root production remained high in the second growing season after hydrologic remediation. Annual tree growth (circumference increment) was not significantly altered by the remediation. The potential of freshwater pulses for regulating tidal swamp production is further supported by observations of higher T.distichum growth in lower salinity and/or pulsed environments across the U.S. Gulf Coast. Usage of freshwater pulses to manage altered estuaries deserves further consideration, particularly because the timing and duration of such pulses could influence both primary production and peat accretion.

This brings along new challenges for the offshore logistics that need to be addressed. These challenges impose more stringent requirements for the logistics system setup, especially on the design and operation of vessels. Copying the logistics system and vessels designed for the North Sea operations is not a sustainable way forward. The few existing studies related to Arctic logistics mainly focus on ship technology solutions for cold and ice infested areas or solutions to the area-specific operational challenges for shipping companies. However, there is a need to understand how these solutions are connected and impact each other in a larger offshore supply logistics system, and thus address the challenges of Arctic logistics as a whole. A methodology for quick evaluation of the feasibility and costs of the logistics system in the early stages of offshore supply planning was developed and presented in previous research [1]. It allows for testing the effects of using alternative ship designs and the overall supply fleet composition on system's cost and performance while satisfying prospective campaign requirements. Safety standards and requirements for emergency preparedness and environmental performance are taken into account while cost effectiveness of the logistics system as a whole is the main quantifiable measure. Building on the new methodology a simulation tool for remote offshore operations has been developed and is presented in current work. Simulation models allow us to consider the dynamic and uncertain nature of variables, such as variation in weekly transport demand, weather impact on sailing times and fuel consumption, and schedule deviations. The evaluation of the performance of a logistic system is done by simulating the logistic operation over a large number of scenarios. Input parameters are weather data generated from historical observations and probability distributions for transport demand. Output from the tool are key performance indicators for: system costs, logistic robustness and emergency preparedness. The tool consists of three main components: simulation of a regular supply logistics operation, simulation of emergency situations, and visualization of the simulated operations. The proposed methodology and tool are tested on real-life cases for offshore supply planning of drilling campaigns in remote areas for one of the major international O&G operators.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-5776-2,,,,,,,,,"SINTEF Ocean, Trondheim, NorwaySINTEF Ocean, Bergen, NorwayStatoil ASA, Trondheim, Norway",,,,2017-12-27,WOS:000417226000003,,

This appears to be due to lack of compiled district data sets and appropriate methods by which to analyse these data. Recently, varietal data on tonnes of sugarcane per hectare (TCH), sugar content (CCS), and their product, tonnes of sugar content per hectare (TSH) on a district basis, have been compiled. This study was conducted to develop a methodology for regular analysis of such data from mill districts to assess productivity trends over time, accounting for variety and variety x environment interaction effects for 3 mill districts (Mulgrave, Babinda, and Tully) from 1958 to 1995. Restricted maximum likelihood methodology was used to analyse the district level data and best linear unbiased predictors for random effects, and best linear unbiased estimates for fixed effects were computed in a mixed model analysis. In the combined analysis over districts, Q124 was the top ranking variety for TCH, and Q120 was top ranking for both CCS and TSH. Overall production for TCH increased over the 38-year period investigated. Some of this increase can be attributed to varietal improvement, although the predictors for TCH have shown little progress since the introduction of Q99 in 1976. Although smaller gains have been made in varietal improvement for CCS, overall production for CCS decreased over the 38 years due to non-varietal factors. Varietal improvement in TSH appears to have peaked in the mid-1980s. Overall production for TSH remained stable over time due to the varietal increase in TCH and the non-varietal decrease in CCS.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,8,1,13,,,0004-9409,1836-5795,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Queensland, Sch Land & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, AustraliaARESTA, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia",ARESTA,,,2001-01-01,WOS:000171351200007,,

While maintaining the flow rate, the solution was switched to sea water (i.e., 0.0 mg/L of lithium) for 16 h. The results show that the tracer moved landward with rising tides and seaward with falling tides. The plume got deeper moving landward and shallower moving seaward of the manifold. Thus, in situations where oil biodegradation is limited by the availability of nutrients or oxygen, applying these chemicals by this technique would allow them to reach entrapped oil seaward of the manifold from below.

We review available information on the effects of windstorms on fragmented forests, synthesizing studies from Australasia, Amazonia and elsewhere in the tropics. Wind damage in fragmented landscapes can be influenced by a range of factors, such as forest-edge orientation, edge structure, the size of nearby clearings and local topography. We argue that wind disturbances are likely to interact with, and exacerbate, a range of deleterious environmental changes in fragmented forests. Among the most important of these are altered forest structure, shifts in plant species composition, exotic-plant invasions, reduced carbon storage and elevated vulnerability to fire.

It was recognised that the technology had the potential to provide a cost effective solution for large-scale arrays of highly sensitive hydrophones which could be interrogated over large distances. Consequently both the United Kingdom and United States navies funded the development of this sonar technology to the point that it is now deployed on submarines and as seabed arrays. The basic design of a fibre-optic hydrophone has changed little; comprising a coil of optical fibre wound on a compliant mandrel, interrogated using interferometric techniques. Although other approaches are being investigated.. including the development of fibre-laser hydrophones, the interferometric approach remains the most efficient way to create highly multiplexed arrays of acoustic sensors. So much so, that the underlying technology is now beino exploited in civil applications. Recently the exploration and production sector of the oil and gas industry has begun funding the development of fibre-optic seismic sensing using seabed mounted, very large-scale arrays of four component (three accelerometers and a hydrophone) packages based upon the original technology developed for sonar systems. This has given new impetus to the development of the sensors and the associated interrogation systems which has led to the technology being adopted for other commercial uses. These include the development of networked in-road fibre-optic Weigh-in-Motion sensors and of intruder detection systems which are able to acoustically monitor long lengths of border, on both land and at sea. After two decades, the fibre-optic hydrophone and associated technology has matured and evolved into a number of highly capable sensing solutions used by a range of industries.",,,,,3rd European Workshop on Optical Fibre Sensors3rd European Workshop on Optical Fibre Sensors,"JUL 04-06, 2007JUL 04-06, 2007","Univ Degli Studi Sannio, Engn Dept, Optoelect Div; SPIE Europe; Soc Italiana Ottica Foton; European Opt SocUniv Degli Studi Sannio, Engn Dept, Optoelect Div; SPIE Europe; Soc Italiana Ottica Foton; European Opt Soc","Naples, ITALYNaples, ITALY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0277-786X,1996-756X,978-0-8194-6761-4,,,,,,,,,"QinetiQ Ltd, Winfrith Technol Ctr, Dorchester DT2 8XJ, Dorset, England",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000250381900006,,

The analysis uses the optimum rate of primary productivity (PP) normalized by units of chlorophyll (Chla) in the water column (P-opt(B)) and Chla concentration. In situ PP estimations using the C-14 method were obtained as part of the seasonal cruises conducted by the Investigaciones Mexicanas de la Corriente de California program. Supplementary data included sea surface temperature (SST) as measured by the AVHRR sensor from 1985-2009. We found the mean value of P-opt(B) to be at 5.1 +/- 3.3 mg C. (mg Chla)(-1).h(-1), with maximum ranges of 0.5 and 17.5 mg C.(mg Chla)(-1).h(-1). The relationship between P-opt(B) and SST suggested a phytoplankton community change at around 19 degrees C, which characterized the transitional nature of the southern portion of the CCS. SST data suggested, on the one hand, that on average the 19 degrees C isotherm is located in the vicinity of Punta Eugenia and, on the other, that its spatial variability defined the alternating cool-warm conditions. At the seasonal scale, this isotherm showed a marked latitudinal displacement (from 24 degrees N to 32 degrees N), which was observed to be even out of this range during interannual events associated with El Nino/La Nina. Under both cool-warm hydrographic conditions, the phytoplanktonic community showed large P-opt(B) rates (similar to 6 mg C.(mg Chla)(-1).h(-1)). At the interannual scale, P-opt(B) changes were associated to changes in the abundance and composition of nano-microphytoplankton. Additionally, data suggested that high PP rates during warm periods could be attributed to an enhanced picoplankton contribution.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0185-3880,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Autonoma Nayarit, CENIT2, Lab Percepc Remota Satelital Ecosistemas Costeros, Tepic 63155, Nayarit, MexicoUniv Autonoma Baja California, Fac Ciencias Marinas, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3917, Ensenada 22860, Baja California, MexicoCtr Invest Cient & Educ Super Ensenada, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3918, Ensenada 22860, Baja California, MexicoUniv Colima, Ctr Univ Invest Oceanol, Carretera Manzanillo Barra de Navidad,Km 20, Manzanillo 28860, MexicoInst Politecn Nacl, Unidad Sinaloa, Ctr Interdisciplinario Invest Desarrollo Integral, Blvd Juan de Dios Batiz Paredes 250, Guasave 81101, Sinaloa, MexicoUniv Bio Bio, Fac Ciencias, Ave Collao 1202,Casilla 5-C, Concepcion 4081112, Chile",Univ Autonoma Nayarit,,,2017-08-11,WOS:000406109100005,,

Such pipes are subject to complex loads, which may lead to significant failure. Tensile armor layers are key components of these flexible pipes, and radial buckling failure may occur under high compressive or other combined loads. In this paper, a simplified numerical model of the flexible pipe is developed using the finite element (FE) method, and the main failure modes of the tensile armor layers are simulated. This simplified model is an improvement over those employed in previous studies on tensile armor failure. Several parameters that have important effects on pipe stiffness are investigated. The results show that an increase in the winding angle of the tensile armor wires as well as the damage to the outer sheath of the flexible pipe will decrease the compressive stiffness significantly. The presence of friction between adjacent layers will increase the stiffness to a small extent while the external hydrostatic pressure enhances its axial stiffness greatly and improve the stability of the pipe. These results may be used as a reference in the development and engineering applications of flexible pipes.",,,,,,,,,8,1,0,0,0,0,9,,,1350-6307,1873-1961,,,,,,,,,,"Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Mechatron Engn, Chengdu 610500, Sichuan, Peoples R China",,,,2019-09-23,WOS:000484364400064,,

The case study of accidental marine oil spill pollution in the coastal area of Dalian, China was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. The coastal areas of Dalian were divided into three zones with risk degrees of high, medium, and low. And detailed countermeasures were proposed for specific risk zones. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, a bottom-up, systematic, reproducible, and transparent literature assessment of the different options to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is currently missing. In part 1 of this three-part review on NETs, we assemble a comprehensive set of the relevant literature so far published, focusing on seven technologies: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation and reforestation, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering, ocean fertilisation, biochar, and soil carbon sequestration. In this part, part 2 of the review, we present estimates of costs, potentials, and side-effects for these technologies, and qualify them with the authors' assessment. Part 3 reviews the innovation and scaling challenges that must be addressed to realise NETs deployment as a viable climate mitigation strategy. Based on a systematic review of the literature, our best estimates for sustainable global NET potentials in 2050 are 0.5-3.6 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for afforestation and reforestation, 0.5-5GtCO(2) yr(-1) for BECCS, 0.5-2GtCO(2) yr(-1) for biochar, 2-4 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for enhanced weathering, 0.5-5 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for DACCS, and up to 5GtCO(2) yr(-1) for soil carbon sequestration. Costs vary widely across the technologies, as do their permanency and cumulative potentials beyond 2050. It is unlikely that a single NET will be able to sustainably meet the rates of carbon uptake described in integrated assessment pathways consistent with 1.5 degrees C of global warming.",,,,,,,,,702,12,0,0,168,0,738,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15,EUREF Campus 19, D-10829 Berlin, GermanyUniv Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, EnglandTech Univ Berlin, Str 17,Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, GermanyUniv Hamburg, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, GermanyPotsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, GermanyUniv Wisconsin Madison, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, 1225 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USAIIASA, ENE Program, Laxenburg, AustriaSwiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, SwitzerlandUniv Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, 23 St Machar Dr, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, ScotlandColorado Sch Mines, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change,,,2018-06-01,WOS:000432858900001,,

Fluid injection/extraction operations generate a pore fluid pressure perturbation into the volume hosting the reservoir which, in turn, may trigger new failures and induce changes in the elastic properties of rocks. Our purpose is to evaluate the feasibility of reconstructing pore pressure perturbation diffusion in the host medium by imaging the 4D velocity changes using active seismic. We simulated repeated active offshore surveys and imaged the target volume. We constructed the velocity model perturbed by the fluid injection using physical modeling and evaluated under which conditions the repeated surveys could image the velocity changes. We found that the induced pressure perturbation causes seismic velocity variations ranging between 2-5% and 15-20%, depending on the different injection conditions and medium properties. So, in most cases, time-lapse tomography is very efficient in tracking the perturbation. The noise level characterizing the recording station sites is a crucial parameter. Since we evaluated the feasibility of the proposed 4D imaging strategy under different realistic environmental and operational conditions, our results can be directly applied to set up and configure the acquisition layout of surveys aimed at retrieving fluid-induced medium changes in the hosting medium.

The effective deployment of environmental monitoring activity can be complex and requires planning and coordination but the levels of preparedness to deliver the necessary expertise, coordination and funding are often low. This paper identifies and describes the importance of 8 principles of effective post-spill monitoring programmes. These principles are then used in the assessment of monitoring preparedness through the generation of a monitoring preparedness assessment score (MPAS). This approach can be used by local, regional or national authorities to establish the level of preparedness for environmental monitoring and prioritise areas for improvement. It also has value to responders, policy makers, environmental scientists and planners as a tool to assess preparedness and capability for specific scenarios. The approach is demonstrated through the assessment of previous incidents and potential future scenarios. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Our TLS estimates agree to within 2% AGB with a species-specific model based on detailed manual crown mapping of 3D tree structure. However TLS-derived AGB was more than 30% higher compared to widely-used general (non species-specific) allometries. We derive an allometry from TLS that spans a much greater range of tree size than previous models and so is potentially better-suited for use with new Earth Observation data for these exceptionally high biomass areas.

This great potential has not been fully realised in practical designs but high performing Stirling machines have found a market in cryogenic and underwater power generation applications. In the latter case, over the last two decades, Stirling systems have been used, in a small 500 ton civilian manned research submarine and in medium-sized operational Nacken and Gotland class naval submarines of the Royal Swedish Navy, as auxiliary power units called Air Independent Propulsion systems (AIPs). Stirling systems have also been investigated for use as the main power units in smaller manned and unmanned autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) as well as diver propulsion devices/vehicles (DPD/Vs) and swimmer delivery vehicles (SDVs). In the post-Cold War environment the latter types of underwater vehicles are attracting increasing interest, particularly in the United States, as navies strive to develop the brown-water or littoral warfare capabilities necessary to prosecute operations in hostile coastal waters. Moreover, with offshore commercial oil and gas production moving into increasing deeper waters and other commercial and scientific ventures requiring AUVs of increasing endurance and under-ice capabilities there is a global interest in developing improved power systems for the new generation of underwater vehicles. The Stirling machine, with its proven record in the underwater environment, is an obvious candidate for such applications.When their cycle of operations is reversed Stirling machines can be used not only to produce power but also to provide cooling, i.e. they can be refrigeration machines and excellent cryocoolers. Many of the emerging underwater technologies such as magnetohydrodynamics' (MHD) and superconducting machinery require cryogenic cooling facilities to operate effectively - as do many sensor systems and the Stirling cooling machines may have a role to play in such systems. The non-naval uses of the oceans have also lead to the need to provide fixed sea-bed installations and habitats with their associated life-support and environmental condition equipment. Stirling machines used as coolers, heat-pumps or in total engine systems could be used in these applications. However, in the main this paper is principally concerned with underwater power systems which produce rather than use electrical power and are used with vehicles that are autonomous, independent and operate wholly submerged.",,,,,9th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE-99)9th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE-99),"MAY 30-JUN 04, 1999MAY 30-JUN 04, 1999","Int Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers; Canadian Assoc Petr Producers; Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Engn Mech Div; Korea Comm Ocean Resources & Engn; Canadian Civil Engineers, Engn Mech Div; Chinese Soc Ocean Engineers; Chinese Soc Naval Architects & Marine Engineers; Chinese Soc Theoret & Applied Mech; Russian Acad Sci; Singapore Struct Steel Soc; Norwegian Petr Soc; Inst Engineers Australia; Kansai Soc Naval Architects, Japan; IRO, Netherlands; Tech Res Ctr Finland; Soc Mat Sci, Japan; Offshore Engn Soc, UK; Ukraine Soc Mech Engineers; IFREMER, France; Scott Polar Res Inst, UK; Inst Engineers Indonesia; Brazilian Soc Naval Architects & Marine EngineersInt Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers; Canadian Assoc Petr Producers; Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Engn Mech Div; Korea Comm Ocean Resources & Engn; Canadian Civil Engineers, Engn Mech Div; Chinese Soc Ocean Engineers; Chinese Soc Naval Architects & Marine Engineers; Chinese Soc Theoret & Applied Mech; Russian Acad Sci; Singapore Struct Steel Soc; Norwegian Petr Soc; Inst Engineers Australia; Kansai Soc Naval Architects, Japan; IRO, Netherlands; Tech Res Ctr Finland; Soc Mat Sci, Japan; Offshore Engn Soc, UK; Ukraine Soc Mech Engineers; IFREMER, France; Scott Polar Res Inst, UK; Inst Engineers Indonesia; Brazilian Soc Naval Architects & Marine Engineers","BREST, FRANCEBREST, FRANCE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1098-6189,,1-880653-40-0,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada",,,,1999-01-01,WOS:000080987600038,,

In a randomized controlled crossover design, the shift workers received a placebo, melatonin (3 mg, 1 hour before bedtime), or bright light (30-minute exposure, individually scheduled) during the first 4 days on the night shift and during the first 4 days on the day shift. Subjective and objective measures of sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and a simple serial reaction-time test) and sleep (diary and actigraphy) were recorded.Results Subjective measures indicated that melatonin modestly reduced sleepiness at work during the day shift and increased sleep by 15-20 minutes per day. Bright light gave values in between those of melatonin and the placebo, but with few significant results. According to the objective measures, bright light improved sleep to a minor degree during the night shift. Hardly any side-effects were reported.Conclusions Melatonin and bright light modestly improved sleep and sleepiness in this field study. In well-controlled simulated nightwork studies, both melatonin and bright light are more effective in alleviating sleepiness and sleep problems.

Because ocean oil spills are a common environmental problem worldwide, the data gathered in the research should benefit many other affected regions. Research will expose students from Alabama to state of the art methods and to a timely research topic. The Weeks Bay field site will serve as an outdoor laboratory for Auburn University Water Education for Alabama Black Belt (WET) outreach activities and existing courses.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1048925,,,,,,,,Auburn University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13530883,,

Porosity was determined from the LWD bulk density log and core-derived values of grain density. In situ measurements of pore-fluid salinity as well as formation temperature define a background trend for pore-fluid resistivity at each drill site. The LWD data were used to define sets of empirical Archie-constants for different depth-intervals of the logged borehole at all sites drilled during the second Ulleung Basin Gas Hydrate Drilling Expedition (UBGH2). A clustering of data with distinctly different trend-lines is evident in the cross-plot of porosity and formation factor for all sites drilled during UBGH2. The reason for the clustering is related to the difference between hemipelagic sediments (mostly covering the top similar to 100 mbsf) and mass-transport deposits (MTD) and/or the occurrence of biogenic opal. For sites located in the north-eastern portion of the Ulleung Basin a set of individual Archie-parameters for a shallow depth interval (hemipelagic) and a deeper MTD zone was achieved. The deeper zone shows typically higher resistivities for the same range of porosities seen in the upper zone, reflecting a shift in sediment properties. The presence of large amounts of biogenic opal (up to and often over 50% as defined by XRD data) was especially observed at Sites UBGH2-2_1 and UBGH2-2_2 (as well as UBGH1-9 from a previous drilling expedition in 2007). The boundary between these two zones can also easily be identified in gamma-ray logs, which also show unusually low readings in the opal-rich interval. Only by incorporating different Archie-parameters for the different zones a reasonable estimate of gas hydrate saturation was achieved that also matches results from other techniques such as pore-fluid freshening, velocity-based calculations, and pressure-core degassing experiments. Seismically, individual boundaries between zones were determined using a grid of regional 2D seismic data. Zoning from the Archie-analysis for sites in the south-western portion of the Ulleung Basin was also observed, but at these sites it is linked to individually stacked MTDs only and does not reflect a mineralogical occurrence of biogenic opal or hemipelagic sedimentation. The individual MTD events represent differently compacted material often associated with a strong decrease in porosity (and increase in density), warranting a separate set of empirical Archie-parameters.

However, only limited progress has been made in detection technologies that focus on downhole parameters due to the complexity of offshore drilling operations that is increasingly shifting towards the deepwater. Therefore, the current paper experimentally explores downhole drilling parameters for kick indication during drilling. The study utilizes a fully instrumented laboratory scale drilling rig coupled with an air injection and surface monitoring systems. This study observed a sudden jump in bottomhole pressure, increased volume of the return fluid, decreased density of the return fluid, reduced rate of penetration, and increased rotary speed as indicators of kick. The most significant new finding, which is also validated with field reports, is the dampening effects of the drilling vibrations due to kick. Frequency analysis of the axial bit-rock displacements/vibrations confirms the changes of frequencies due to kick induction during drilling. Coupling this important finding with dynamic drilling models, the response of the drilling system at surface (e.g. standpipe, choke pressures, etc.) indicating this change can be predicted.",,,,,,,,,10,2,0,0,0,0,10,,,2190-0558,2190-0566,,,,,,,,,,"Mem Univ, Fac Engn & Appl Sci, Proc Engn Dept, C RISE, St John, NF, CanadaMem Univ, Fac Engn & Appl Sci, Proc Engn Dept, DTL, St John, NF, Canada",,,,2019-03-19,WOS:000460360300046,,

The massive oil discharge in oilfield may offer a chance for a natural experiment to investigate compositional changes of oil residues and study the stability of source- and weathering-dependent molecular parameters in oil residues after spills. The results demonstrate that the conventional diagnostic ratios, such as C(29)20S/(20S + 20R), C-29/C30H, C-30 beta alpha/alpha beta, C(31)22S/(22S + 22R), C-2-DBTs/C-2-PHENs, C-3-DBTs/C-3-PHENs, DET/MCHRY, CHRY/PHENs, are also valid for oil source identification even after extensive weathering of spilled oils in terrestrial environment, although some exceptions were encountered for extensively weathered sample. Moreover, the ratios of selected specific biomarkers (the oleanane index, the gammacerane index) have been developed and assessed as source indicators. Finally, we find that some maturity parameters based on alkyl naphthalenes and methyl phenanthrenes in petroleum geochemistry, such as the methylnaphthalene ratios (TMNr, TeMNr, PMNr), the methylphenanthrene ratios (MPI-1, MPDF), can be applied for the source identification and correlation at their lightly to moderately weathered stage.

We generate nearly three decades of remotely sensed canopy water content throughout California, which we use to determine patterns of drought stress. Linking these patterns of drought stress with meteorological variables enables us to quantify spatially explicit biophysical drought resistance in terms of magnitude and duration. These maps reveal significant spatial heterogeneity in drought resistance and demonstrate that almost all forests have less resistance to severe, persistent droughts. By identifying the spatial patterning of biophysical drought resistance, we quantify an important component of long-term ecosystem stability that can be used for forest conservation, management, and policy decisions.Plain Language Summary As hot droughts become more frequent and more severe, it is important for long-term forest management to understand which forests are at risk and which have the capacity to withstand these events. To address this challenge, we generated and analyzed maps of canopy water content through time and compared them to maps of meteorology. This analysis revealed that some locations were able to endure significantly more drought before succumbing to significant canopy water loss, which indicates drought resistance. Our findings also highlighted that the effects of a recent, severe drought have persisted multiple years after the drought subsided.

A submarine pipeline in a submerged floating tunnel (SFT) is presented as a potential way to avoid pipeline-related environmental concerns. The key task in developing this submarine pipeline concept is to integrate solutions to the environmental challenges associated with submarine pipelines into the SFT structure.From a technical standpoint, one of the most important design tasks is to calculate the SFT's buoyancy weight ratio (BWR) value, thereby determining the tunnel's stability. The greatest threat to stability is the phenomenon of tether slack, which occurs at a specific BWR value. The pipeline's weight affects its BWR value, so the weight must be restricted to ensure that tether slack does not occur. In the present study, the proposed SFT's BWR value was simulated by testing a laboratory model in various ballasts. Significant waves and individual waves in a hundred-year return period were investigated based on data related to Java Sea waves at the Indonesian Hydrodynamic Laboratory (IHL).This study tested the SFT laboratory model against regular waves to find the BWR value at which tether slack might occur. The obtained BWR value was used to determine the requirement for total pipeline weight. Using a 1: 100 scale of the real environmental conditions, the laboratory results revealed that slack occurs in a significant wave when the BWR value is 1.2, making the maximum pipeline weight to be placed in the SFT 534 tons. For the individual wave, slack occurs when the BWR value is 1.4, making the maximum pipeline weight to be placed in the SFT267.214 tons.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,2086-9614,2087-2100,,,,,,,,,,"Mulawarman Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Gunung Kelua Campus, Samarinda 75119, IndonesiaInst Teknol Sepuluh Nopember, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Sukolilo Campus, Surabaya 75119, Indonesia",,,,2017-08-15,WOS:000406639100017,,

Over the last decade there has been a growing interest in marine renewable energy, resulting in the rapid development of offshore energy installations. Construction of this infrastructure typically involves pile-driving and support ships, which have raised concerns about the resulting environmental impact of high sound levels on species such as marine mammals and fish. As the marine renewable energy industry develops, our understanding of the noise produced and the potential effects on marine species must be improved so that appropriate mitigation procedures can be developed.This project aims to provide an evidence-based tool to forecast the effects of anthropogenic noise on marine fish. The initial literature review will provide a meta-analysis of projects that have been undertaken within the field of underwater propagation modelling and/or have identified behavioural impacts of anthropogenic noise on marine fish. The outputs of the review will inform subsequent tasks, specifically the design of the field measurements for the behavioural assessments. In addition, the review will help to define the acronyms, metrics and assumptions most used in the literature associated with the models. This will improve the understanding and interpretation of existing models, and inform on which is the most appropriate model for noise studies.This project aims to collect behavioural data for ecologically and economically important UK fish species to improve the existing tool (HAMMER model) and predict direct effects of anthropogenic noise exposure. Anticipated measurements range from instantaneous responses to significant avoidance and abandonment of the study area. Behavioural data will be collected at the installation area using wild animals. In addition, behavioural experiments will also be carried at the University of Exeter. The laboratory environment will enable experiments to be performed under controlled conditions, playing back the sounds collected at the study area to observe the responses of fish. There are few studies which have analysed the effects of underwater noise produced by tidal turbines on marine species and this project will aid understanding of the potential consequences. The main source of anthropogenic noise considered in this project will be from the installation and operation of the SME tidal turbine at Trinity Wharf, East Cowes. The device used is new and there is little information on associated noise emissions. It is expected that drilling will be used to fix the mooring points, however, the greatest interest will be given to the operational noise. The PLAT-O system uses small vessels to operate and maintain the tidal energy system. The noise from the vessels will be taken into account along with the noise emitted from the tidal turbine device.The project will collect data on the background noise and incorporate them into the model.SME will benefit from having experimental data that support their sustainable energy activity and assess whether the development of such constructions is environmentally safe and does not present a danger for biodiversity. HR Wallingford will benefit greatly by improving their model to predict the impact of anthropogenic noise on fish behaviour.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/L014335/1,,,,,,,,Newcastle University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15370077,,
J,"ANDREWS, JAY D.",,,,,,,,,,Oyster mortality studies in Virginia. IV. MSX in James River public seed beds,,,,,,,,PROC NAT SHELLFISH ASS,,,,53,,,,65,84,,,,,,,,,,,Meeting,1964,1964,"MSX, an unnamed pathogen of oysters, caused an epizootic in Chesapeake Bay which removed from production nearly half of Virginia's private oyster-planting acreage between 1959 and 1961. The organism did not appear in James River seed beds until fall of 1960. A tongue-shaped distribution of MSX was apparently related to influx of salt water along the channel. In 1960-61 and 1961-62, infections of MSX appeared at Wreck Shoal in the middle of the seed area in October, and disappeared the following April coincident with lowest salinities. Infection levels were approximately 30 to 35% each year in populations adjacent to the channel. No appreciable cold-season mortality occurred at Wreck Shoal. MSX was nearly absent from Wreck Shoal oysters during the warm season in summer salinities of about 15 ppt, but at Brown Shoals, with salinities 2 or 3 ppt higher, it persisted through spring freshets and caused summer deaths. From observations for three rather wet years, it is concluded tha persistence of MSX infections in the James River seed area depends upon importation of infective material from the saltier waters of Lower James River and Hampton Roads. Also, damage to the seed area will probably be reflected in qualtiy of seed rather than direct mortality. Planting infected seed in high-salinity waters leads to serious losses. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author",,,,,"Joint Convention of the Oyster Institute of North America and Oyster Growers and Dealers Association of North America, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland, 29 July-2 August, 1962Joint Convention of the Oyster Institute of North America and Oyster Growers and Dealers Association of North America, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland, 29 July-2 August, 1962",,,,27,1,0,0,10,0,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Virginia Ins.

We tested for spatial generality of and thresholds in this effect across 103 salt marsh sites spanning similar to 430 kilometers of shoreline in coastal Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, using data collected as part of the natural resource damage assessment (NRDA). Our analyses revealed a threshold for oil impacts on marsh edge erosion, with higher erosion rates occurring for similar to 1-2 years after the spill at sites with the highest amounts of plant stem oiling (90-100%).

This oil has a range of deleterious effects on the aquatic and coastal ecosystems of the Gulf. One such effect may include alteration of biogeochemical cycling of heavy metals in the coastal wetlands. Cycling of mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As) both depend on microbial activity, particularly iron and sulfate reduction, which may be promoted by the influx of organic matter (i.e. oil). Coastal wetlands are particularly susceptible to heavy metal contamination and may therefore be especially vulnerable to altered heavy metal cycling as a result of the oil spill. This project would examine solids and pore waters from sediment cores in Weeks Bay, Alabama for changes in microbial activity, arsenic concentration and speciation, and mercury concentration and speciation over the next eight to twelve months. Results will be of broad interest to the fields of bioremediation, biogeochemistry, geomicrobiology, and environmental health. During the progress of the study, PIs will be cooperating with local scientists and government officials, and plan on presenting technical seminars and workshops in the Alabama Gulf shore region. Because ocean oil spills are a common environmental problem worldwide, the data gathered in the research should benefit many other affected regions. Research will expose students from Alabama to state of the art methods and to a timely research topic. The Weeks Bay field site will serve as an outdoor laboratory for Auburn University Water Education for Alabama Black Belt (WET) outreach activities and existing courses.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1048919,,,,,,,,Auburn University at Montgomery,Auburn University at Montgomery,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13658597,,

A framework approach for modelling of hydrogen uptake out of the environment has been developed which can easily be incorporated into finite element calculation of hydrogen diffusion in steel welds.In particular, martensitic stainless steels are to be considered as a less expensive alternative in North Sea oil and gas pipeline fabrication. Since such materials might be sensitive to hydrogen assisted weld cracking as well as to environmental cracking at sour service conditions, finite element analysis of hydrogen uptake and diffusion in martensitic stainless TIG welds have been performed by using such framework solutions as well as literature and experimental evaluated diffusion coefficients.

PW is difficult to monitor as releases are rapidly diluted and concentrations can reach trace levels. The use of passive samplers can over come this. Here polyethylene (PE) was calibrated for a diverse range of PW pollutants. Zebrafish were exposed to dilutions of PW and passive sampler extracts in order to investigate the relationship between freely dissolved chemical concentrations and acute toxic effects. The raw PW had an LC50 of 13% (percentage of PW in the standardized zebrafish medium). Observed non-viable deformations to embryos (at 5 hpf) included heart and yolk edema, head, spine and tail deformations. The dose-response relationship of lethal effects showed that if 0.0041 g of PE is exposed to this PW, then extracted, 50% of exposed D. rerio will suffer lethal effects. The sum of tested freely dissolved concentrations that led to 50% lethal effects (mortality and non-viable deformations) was 2.32 x 10(-4) mg/L for PW and 7.92 x 10(-2) mg/L for PE. This implies that exposure to raw PW was more toxic than exposure to PE extracts. This toxicity was attributed both to the presence of contaminants as well as PW salinity. Passive samplers are able to detect very low freely dissolved pollutant concentrations which is important for assessing the spatial dilution of PW releases. Bioassays provide complimentary information as they account for all toxic compounds including those that are not taken up by passive samplers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Using new distribution maps for all of the world's forest-dependent birds (60.6% of all bird species), we quantify the contribution of remaining forest to conserving global avian biodiversity. For each of the world's partly or wholly forested 5-km cells, we estimated an impact score of its contribution to the distribution of all the forest bird species estimated to occur within it, and so is proportional to the impact on the conservation status of the world's forest-dependent birds were the forest it contains lost. The distribution of scores was highly skewed, a very small proportion of cells having scores several orders of magnitude above the global mean. Ecoregions containing the highest values of this score included relatively species-poor islands such as Hawaii and Palau, the relatively species-rich islands of Indonesia and the Philippines, and the megadiverse Atlantic Forests and northern Andes of South America. Ecoregions with high impact scores and high deforestation rates (2000-2005) included montane forests in Cameroon and the Eastern Arc of Tanzania, although deforestation data were not available for all ecoregions. Ecoregions with high impact scores, high rates of recent deforestation and low coverage by the protected area network included Indonesia's Seram rain forests and the moist forests of Trinidad and Tobago. Key sites in these ecoregions represent some of the most urgent priorities for expansion of the global protected areas network to meet Convention on Biological Diversity targets to increase the proportion of land formally protected to 17% by 2020.

In order for WSN to achieve trademark performance in remote monitoring of pipelines, and surpass the performance of present-day traditional monitoring systems, certain design requirements must be met. In this paper, we identify vital design issues that must be considered to facilitate the employment of WSN for pipeline monitoring. We classify these design issues into five different categories namely; sensing modality, power efficiency, energy harvesting, network reliability and localization. In addition, we discuss the concept of cooperative communication for pipeline-monitoring sensor networks deployed in sub-sea environments. We also study the employment of sensor networks for monitoring underground pipelines. Our findings are based on extensive study of the recent literature and comprehensive survey of existing WSN technologies. The WSN design considerations presented in this paper are particularly prolific for pipeline monitoring scenarios, they can however be easily extended to other oil and gas infrastructures. For example; well-head and heat exchanger monitoring, oil platform process monitoring, monitoring of natural gas storage facilities and data collection on coastal infrastructures that could support oil and gas exploration.

However, an EQD operation is in itself considered a risky operation with a major economic impact. For this reason, it is of great importance to aid the operators in their assessment of the situation at all times, and help them make the best decisions. However, despite the availability of such systems, accidents do happen. This demonstrates the vulnerability of our human decision-making capabilities in extremely stressful situations. One way of improving the overall human-system performance with respect to EQD is to increase the level and quality of the automation and decision support systems. Although there is plenty of evidence that automated systems have weaknesses, there is also evidence that advanced software systems outperform humans in complex decision-making. The major challenge is to make sure that EQD is performed when necessary, but there is also a need to decrease the number of false EQDs. This paper applies an existing framework for levels of automation in order to explore the critical decision process leading to an EQD. We provide an overview of the benefits and drawbacks of existing automation and decision support systems vs. manual human decision-making. Data are collected from interviews of offshore users, suppliers, and oil companies, as well as from formal operational procedures. Findings are discussed using an established framework for the level of automation. Our conclusion is that there is an appropriate level of automation in critical situations related to the loss of the position of the drill rig, and that there is the promising potential to increase the autonomy level in a mid-and long-term situation assessment.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,2077-1312,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Coll Southeast Norway, Inst Maritime Operat, N-3603 Kongsberg, NorwayUniv Coll Southeast Norway, Dept Sci & Ind Syst, N-3603 Kongsberg, Norway",,,,2018-06-19,WOS:000428558900016,,

The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a twenty-four-month research fellowship by Dr. Andrew J. Lucas to work with Dr. Grant Pitcher at Marine and Coastal Management in South Africa, Dr. Frank Shillington at the University of Cape Town, Dr. Raphael Kudela at the University of California, Santa Cruz and with Dr. John Largier at the University of California, Davis. Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are a growing global problem, causing hundreds of millions of dollars of economic, environmental, and health losses each year. Autonomous, wave-powered profiling instruments (Wirewalkers, WW) are being used to study HAB dynamics from a Lagrangian (freely-drifting) and Eulerian (moored) perspective. These studies are being performed in the Benguela Current System (BCS) and California Current System (CCS) in collaboration with researchers from Marine and Coastal Management (a Department of Government of South Africa), the Department of Oceanography, University of Cape Town, South Africa, the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the University of California, Davis. The autonomous wave-driven WW profilers are providing the first Lagrangian dataset of sufficient resolution to explicitly test hypotheses concerning advective versus in situ change in HAB populations. The results from this study are augmenting ongoing comparative studies of HAB dynamics in the southern Benguela and northern Monterey Bay upwelling systems. The interplay between the physical dynamics of upwelling systems and phytoplankton (HAB) bloom formation is not fully understood. This fact limits the ability to predict the onset and severity of individual HAB events as well as the influence of global climate change on HAB frequency, intensity, and geographic extent. The ongoing research is providing the first set of well-resolved, simultaneous measurements of physical and biological variables from the perspective of moored and Lagrangian measurements under conditions of active upwelling and during periods of relaxation. This uniquely detailed dataset is advancing our understanding of the small-scale physical dynamics that control phytoplankton bloom initiation, maintenance, and transport of HABs to coastal waters. Our increased mechanistic understanding of these physical controls will permit an improved predictive capability of HAB events. Accurately forecasting HAB events from a combination of low-cost monitoring, satellite products, and numerical models can provide enormous societal benefit, particularly as HAB mitigation strategies evolve?potential saving significant sums of money and, most importantly, safeguarding human health in impacted coastal communities. Strong secular change in the CCS, driven by global climate variability, has modified the physical environment and led to increased occurrences of dinoflagellate HABs. Changes in hydrographic properties of the CCS show that it is becoming more like the BCS under forcing by global change. Thus comparative studies between the BCS and the CCS, such as the current project, are increasing our understanding of the potential for significant biological change in the CCS and BCS driven by global warming.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,853106,,,,,,,,Lucas Andrew J,Lucas Andrew J,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13835088,,

This paper examines how a range of incentives offered as part of the Marasin Stoa Kipa program, a community-based malaria diagnosis and treatment program that has been implemented since 2007 within a major oil and gas development area in Papua New Guinea, are perceived and critiqued by community-based health workers. Nineteen interviews and seven focus group discussions with the workers who deliver services and members of the communities served by the program, conducted between November 4 and 25, 2015, reveal a pattern of mixed motivations and changes in motivation over time. This can be attributed partly to the unique social and economic circumstances in which the program is operating. Changes in the burden of disease as well as in global and national health services policy with implications for local level program operations also had an impact, as did the nature of relationships between program managers, community-based health workers, and program beneficiaries. Overall, the findings suggest that while financial and in-kind incentives can be a useful tool to motivate voluntary or minimally-compensated community-based health workers, they must be carefully structured to align with local social, economic, and epidemiological realities over the long-term.

Despite these efforts, there are relatively few data comparing net ecosystem exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the biosphere (NEE), under both ambient and elevated C-a. Here we report data on annual sums of CO2 (NEEnet) for 19years on a Chesapeake Bay tidal wetland for Scirpus olneyi (C-3 photosynthetic pathway)- and Spartina patens (C-4 photosynthetic pathway)-dominated high marsh communities exposed to ambient and elevated C-a (ambient+340ppm). Our objectives were to (i) quantify effects of elevated C-a on seasonally integrated CO2 assimilation (NEEnet = NEEday + NEEnight, kgCm(-2)y(-1)) for the two communities; and (ii) quantify effects of altered canopy N content on ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration. Across all years, NEEnet averaged 1.9kgm(-2)y(-1) in ambient C-a and 2.5kgm(-2)y(-1) in elevated C-a, for the C-3-dominated community. Similarly, elevated C-a significantly (P<0.01) increased carbon uptake in the C-4-dominated community, as NEEnet averaged 1.5kgm(-2)y(-1) in ambient C-a and 1.7kgm(-2)y(-1) in elevated C-a. This resulted in an average CO2 stimulation of 32% and 13% of seasonally integrated NEEnet for the C-3- and C-4-dominated communities, respectively. Increased NEEday was correlated with increased efficiencies of light and nitrogen use for net carbon assimilation under elevated C-a, while decreased NEEnight was associated with lower canopy nitrogen content. These results suggest that rising C-a may increase carbon assimilation in both C-3- and C-4-dominated wetland communities.

Simultaneously, it is also clear that activities and interventions of anthropogenic origin (such as the construction of dams, holding of inerts in rivers and dredging operations in ports) have contributed to strongly disturb these systems, notably through a significant reduction of sediment supply. Accordingly, these actions threaten the ability of the coastal areas to adapt to the increasing frequency and intensity of storm events, as a result of global climate change and the expected increase in the average sea level, which will inevitably lead to a pronounced erosion and to the consequent retreat of the shorelines. Knowing that banning the uses of coastal zones is not a solution to the serious constraints that exist, it is then necessary to recover them with the necessary infrastructures in order to guarantee that their intensive uses are not necessarily synonymous of degradation. The Leirosa sand dune system, located at south of Figueira da Foz, has been the scene of three major dune rehabilitation interventions in the past twelve years. The first involved the reconstruction of the sand dunes followed by revegetation using native marram grass. The effectiveness of this rehabilitation technique could not be confirmed, since the ocean side of the dune system was destroyed at the end of the winter of 2000-2001. In the other two interventions, two different applications of geotextiles were used. The first technique consisted in constructing several layers of sand enclosed in geotextiles, a so-called wrap-around technique, which stabilizes the sand and is quickly installed. The second technique was employed to protect the toe of the constructed barrier, which entailed the use of geotextile tube technology. The lessons learned with the methodology used for the rehabilitation and protection of the Leirosa sand dunes allowed to address new protection concepts, incorporating multi-functionality and environmental enhancing. It is in this context that we propose the implementation of multifunctional artificial reefs as alternative or complementary technique to traditional heavy protections. Examples of success are known, but there are not yet sufficiently detailed and systematic studies so that this kind of constructions could be generalized along the coastal zones, particularly with the dual aim of protecting them and improving the characteristics of many of their bathing spaces. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is to present a short description of the works carried out in Leirosa, and to propose a complementary protection using the same material, but in submerged conditions and with a suitable geometry, in order to take advantage of the changes occurring in a wave when propagating from deep water conditions to shallow waters.",,"Os problemas existentes na generalidade dos países com extensas zonas costeiras estão, de alguma forma, direta ou indiretamente ligados à progressiva ocupação urbana destas zonas, tendo como consequência uma forte degradação de muitas das estruturas naturais de proteção existentes. Simultaneamente, é também claro que diversas atividades e intervenções de origem antrópica (como a construção de barragens, a exploração de inertes fluviais, as ações de dragagem portuárias, etc.) têm vindo a perturbar fortemente as zonas balneares, nomeadamente através de uma significativa redução do abastecimento sedimentar das praias. Concomitantemente, estas ações ameaçam a capacidade que as zonas costeiras tiveram outrora de se adaptarem ao aumento da frequência e intensidade dos eventos de tempestades, em consequência das alterações climáticas globais, bem como à previsível subida do nível médio das águas do mar, que conduzirá inevitavelmente a uma acentuada erosão costeira e ao consequente recuo das linhas de costa. Sendo certo que proibir o usufruto das zonas costeiras não é solução para os graves constrangimentos existentes, importa então valorizá-las com as infraestruturas indispensáveis para que os seus usos intensivos não sejam necessariamente sinónimo de degradação. Os ensinamentos colhidos com uma metodologia de reabilitação e defesa frontal do cordão dunar da Leirosa, a sul da Figueira da Foz, permitiram abordar novos conceitos de proteção, incorporando múltiplas funções e valorização ambiental.

How the abandonment affects the forest structural factors and carbon stocks has not been studied. 50 Moso bamboo forest plots with different abandonment times were investigated in the subtropical region of the southeast coast of China, and we analyzed the effects of abandonment time on the structural factors and carbon storage allocation pattern. Abandonment affected the forest structural factors, especially after 6 years of abandonment. Compared with general management, the culm density was nearly 3 times as normal, the mean age rose from 2.33 +/- 1.14 du to 3.23 +/- 1.04 du, and the diameter at breast (DBH) decreased by 15.7% after 15-18 years of abandonment. The carbon storage of the individual culm was reduced by 25% due to the smaller DBH, but the bamboo stand carbon stocks were about 2.5 times normal due to the excessive density. Correspondingly, the proportion of vegetation C in ecosystems has increased from 21.69% to 35.95%, even though the understory carbon stocks were lowest in the forests abandoned for eleven or more years. The soil organic carbon (SOC) in the topsoil layer was higher with the extension of the abandonment time while there was no significant difference in the deep. Litter and understory vegetation account for only a small fraction of the entire ecosystem's carbon stocks, especially in the Moso bamboo forest for a longer abandonment time.

The LFAC is nowadays becoming a popular choice for long-distance power transmission due to its high efficiency and low losses. This research work investigates the feasibility of employing the LFAC system for subsea transmission and distribution of 58 MW power. In this paper, the simulation model of the LFAC-based subsea transmission and distribution system is presented. This model is composed of several parts such as hexverter as a frequency converter, where a novel control strategy to optimize its zero-sequence circulating current is employed. Detailed mathematical modeling based on active, reactive power constraints and DQ transformation is performed to achieve the control strategy for zero-sequence current optimization. An offshore wind farm is proposed to be integrated with the LFAC subsea system to fulfill the compatibility requirements of the system. The control system of both the grid side and the machine-side inverter of the wind farm is designed to eliminate the real-time disturbances such as wind speed fluctuations and harmonics due to heavy inductive load operating at 16 Hz. To drive the subsea pump, a vector control-based variable-speed drive is employed for the heavy induction motor. A 5 MW, 16 Hz RL load is also added in the model to analyze the effect of general-purpose load. Each component of this system is carefully designed to make it as close to real-time as possible.

For new applications, such as the marine renewable energy (MRE) sector synthetic ropes are potentially an enabling technology due to their load reduction properties and relative low cost compared to conventional mooring component materials.Existing design, test and certification procedures for ropes were developed for the station keeping of large offshore equipment. Arrays of small, reactive MRE devices will have an entirely different set of mooring load cases with the mooring system potentially an integral part of the power take off system. Larger devices are also likely to be subjected to complex loading as MRE deployment sites are typically highly energetic in terms of wind, wave and/or tidal energy. Consequently devices and associated subsystems are subjected to dynamic load cases in a wide range of complex environmental and operating conditions. Underpinning research is therefore required to understand the behaviour of synthetic materials subjected to highly dynamic loading regimes in terms of operational performance and long-term durability as these factors could have a significant impact on coupled device performance and availability. At present conventional mooring analyses is based on the use of simplified rope characteristics, although several studies including a Joint Industry Project (Syrope) have investigated these aspects. However, at present an industry-standard method to account for the time-varying behaviour of synthetic ropes for offshore equipment moorings does not exist.The SynMaRE (Synthetic ropes for Marine Renewable Energy mooring systems) project aims to develop a time domain analytical model that can adequately represent the time dependent and non-trivial behaviour of synthetic ropes. Instead of being a stand-alone tool, it is intended that the model will be adopted for incorporation in (or with) commercial mooring system software allowing the prediction of mooring loads and device responses to an increased level of accuracy. This paper will present findings from an initial assessment of parameter estimation techniques utilising a simplified viscoelastic and viscoplastic model and validation scenarios based on physical tension-tension test data featuring load cases relevant to MRE mooring systems.",,,,,"37th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering37th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 17-22, 2018JUN 17-22, 2018","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","Madrid, SPAINMadrid, SPAIN",4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,,,978-0-7918-5120-3,,,,,,,,,"Univ Exeter, Penryn, EnglandTens Technol Int, Eastbourne, EnglandLankhorst Euronete, Paredes, Portugal",Tens Technol IntLankhorst Euronete,,,2018-11-20,WOS:000449308100072,,

Sea-level rise and other climate-change-induced disturbances threaten coastal wetland sustainability and carbon storage capacity. It is critical that we understand the mechanisms controlling wetland carbon loss so that we can predict and manage these resources in anticipation of climate change. However, our current understanding of the mechanisms that control soil organic matter decomposition, in particular the impacts of elevated salinity, are limited, and literature reports are contradictory. In an attempt to improve our understanding of these complex processes, we measured root and rhizome decomposition and developed a causal model to identify and quantify the mechanisms that influence soil organic matter decomposition in coastal wetlands that are impacted by sea-level rise. We identified three causal pathways: (1) a direct pathway representing the effects of flooding on soil moisture, (2) a direct pathway representing the effects of salinity on decomposer microbial communities and soil biogeochemistry, and (3) an indirect pathway representing the effects of salinity on litter quality through changes in plant community composition over time. We used this model to test the effects of alternate scenarios on the response of tidal freshwater forested wetlands and oligohaline marshes to short-and long-term climate-induced disturbances of flooding and salinity. In tidal freshwater forested wetlands, the model predicted less decomposition in response to drought, hurricane salinity pulsing, and long-term sea-level rise. In contrast, in the oligohaline marsh, the model predicted no change in response to drought and sea-level rise, and increased decomposition following a hurricane salinity pulse. Our results show that it is critical to consider the temporal scale of disturbance and the magnitude of exposure when assessing the effects of salinity intrusion on carbon mineralization in coastal wetlands.

The system integrates hydrodynamic, transport and oil weathering modules, which can be combined to offer different-complexity descriptions as required by applications across the river-to-ocean continuum. Features include accounting for different composition and reology in the surface and water column mixtures, as well as spreading, evaporation, water-in-oil emulsification, shoreline retention, dispersion and dissolution. The use of unstructured grids provides flexibility and efficiency in handling spills in complex geometries and across scales. The use of high-order Eulerian-Lagrangian methods allows for computational efficiency and for handling key processes in ways consistent with their distinct mathematical nature and time scales. The modeling system is tested through a suite of synthetic, laboratory and realistic-domain benchmarks, which demonstrate robust handling of key processes and of 2D/3D couplings. The application of the modeling system to a spill scenario at the entrance of a port in a coastal lagoon illustrates the power of the approach to represent spills that occur in coastal regions with complex boundaries and bathymetry.

The combustion mechanism of VCE differs from HE in particular in complex geometries (e.g. offshore oil and gas production facilities) as there exist many objects which can trigger severe turbulences. Although many research efforts have been made to develop design provisions for blast resistant structures, most of those provisions are based on high-order explosives (HE) such as TNT (TriNiTrotoluene) in a free field. Therefore, typical blast resistant structural design standards were examined to address the weaknesses of standards in this study.

The analysis on the isotopes of C, O, Sr and other geochemical features shows that the dolomitizing process happened in fluid rich in Mg2+ and lean in Ca2+ and brought in Fe2+, Mn2+ and took out Sr2+; with the rise of recrystallization, the Fe2+ , Mn2+ contents tend to increase while delta O-18(PDB) and Srcontent tend to decrease. According to the variation of Sr-87/Sr-86 and other geochemical features, it is considered that the dolomitizing fluid participating in the reservoir diagenesisis the high salinity sea water later than the end of Feixianguan stage, and the dolomitization takes place mainly through the multiple thermal convective cycle effect. The micritic dolomite is of evaporative dolomitization origin with the characteristics of high Sr2+, Na+ and low Mn2+ which reflects the open environment of the surface exposed in the quasi syngenetic period, while the reef dolomite is of high Mg/Ca dolomitizing fluid origin with the characteristics of low Sr-2 , Na+ and Mn2+, whose diagenetic environment changed from near surface to shallow burial environment; crystalline dolomite is formed by metasomatism of low Mg/Ca dolomitizing fluid at deep burial depth and high temperature, with the increase of burial depth,in the high temperature and high pressure deep sealing system, its Fe2+ and Mn2+ elements increased while Sr2+ decreased. Through reconstruction of dynamic diagenesis-pore evolution, it is concluded that the low porosity of shallow beach grain dolomite is resulted from early compaction and medium-term cementation, yet the reservoir quality has been apparently improved by the later hydrocarbon dissolution; compared with shallow beach grain dolomite,the reef dolomite has smaller initial porosity, but stronger compressive capacity. The early compaction and medium-term cementation have less impact on the reef dolomite, and the later dissolution strength is slightly weaker than that of the granular dolomite, thus the change range of porosity is smaller than that of the grain dolomite; the micrite-silt dolomite mainly suffered porosity reduction caused by compaction, and the later burial dissolution and recrystallization are key to the quality improvement of this kind of dolomite reservoir.",,,,,,,,,9,3,0,0,0,0,12,,,0920-4105,1873-4715,,,,,,,,,,"Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R ChinaChengdu Univ Technol, Inst Sedimentary Geol, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R ChinaSouthwest Petr Univ, Sch Geosci & Technol, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China",,,,2020-11-01,WOS:000565557400008,,

Removal of unpaved forest roads has the potential for increasing carbon storage in soils on forested terrain as treated sites revegetate and soil properties improve on the previously compacted road surfaces. We compared soil organic carbon (SOC) content at several depths on treated roads to SOC in adjacent second-growth forests and old-growth redwood forests in California, determined whether SOC in the upper 50 cm of soil varies with the type of road treatment, and assessed the relative importance of site-scale and landscape-scale variables in predicting SOC accumulation in treated road prisms and second-growth redwood forests. Soils were sampled at 5, 20, and 50 cm depths on roads treated by two methods (decommissioning and full recontouring), and in adjacent second-growth and old-growth forests in north coastal California. Road treatments spanned a period of 32 years, and covered a range of geomorphic and vegetative conditions. SOC decreased with depth at all sites. Treated roads on convex sites exhibited higher SOC than on concave sites, and north aspect sites had higher SOC than south aspect sites. SOC at 5, 20, and 50 cm depths did not differ significantly between decommissioned roads (treated 18-32 years previous) and fully recontoured roads (treated 2-12 years previous). Nevertheless, stepwise multiple regression models project higher SOC developing on fully recontoured roads in the next few decades. The best predictors for SOC on treated roads and in second-growth forest incorporated aspect, vegetation type, soil depth, lithology, distance from the ocean, years since road treatment (for the road model) and years since harvest (for the forest model). The road model explained 48% of the variation in SOC in the upper 50 cm of mineral soils and the forest model, 54%.

To track the fate of toxic contaminants in ISB residues, a conservative hopane biomarker, such as C-30-alpha beta hopane, is often used. Furthermore, diagnostic ratios of various hopanes are used for source oil identification. Use of these biomarkers assume that during ISB the quantity of C-30-alpha beta hopane will be conserved, and the diagnostic ratios of various hopanes will be stable. The objective of this study is to test the validity of these two assumptions. We conducted laboratory-scale ISB experiments using a model oil prepared from commercial C-30-alpha beta hopane standard, and a reference crude oil.

Under cost recovery, all contractors are requested to meet obligation on property tax in the first pace, meanwhile assume and discharge stipulate that government will bear LBT expense. LBT expense is also treated as operating cost that will recover after the work area has reached commercial production. This new policy invited pros and cons particularly since the release of Notice of LBT Payable from Directorate General of Tax for 16 Production Sharing Contractors with a huge amount of IDR 2,6 trillion. This amount was higher than three years firm commitment and the base of LBT imposed was offshore work area in a whole as stated in a signed contract document. The imposition of LBT in the upstream oil and gas business activity has become a determinant variable for investors either existing or candidate in business forecasting and decision making on oil and gas investment. It can be seen from the decrease of candidate of investors' participation in the tender of exploration work area in the first pace of 2013. This tender was only followed by 37,5% applicants, compared to the preceding ones that participations reached 90%. In addition, there was a propensity of investors to resign from the existing exploration projects due to the high burden of fiscal expenses. We analysed the impact of new policy concerning the upstream oil and gas business tax property on the Indonesia program of national energy security. Based on comprehensive analysis, we recommend government to amend related policy and law in order to connect with current development as well as to protect Indonesia economy and state budget. Besides, it is necessary to protect oil and gas investors and to mend the investment climate as well. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We present a method for quantifying anticipated ecological benefits associated with marsh restoration projects, particularly marsh creation or enhancement through the placement of dredged material, in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Using salt marsh vegetation (percent cover, aboveground biomass, and belowground biomass) and indicator faunal species (periwinkle snails and amphipods) as representative marsh community components, we used resource equivalency analysis (REA) to model projected ecological benefits over time and quantified total net project benefits for a hypothetical marsh creation project in Barataria Bay, Louisiana. Sensitivity analysis of the resulting model suggests that the recovery trajectories for each marsh component were the most important drivers of modeled restoration benefits and that model uncertainty was greatest for marsh fauna, which has limited data availability compared to marsh vegetation and high natural variability. Longer-term monitoring at restored restoration sites and/or targeted monitoring of older restoration projects would reduce variability in the recovery trajectories for the marsh community components examined in this case study and improve the reliability of the REA model for projecting benefits associated with salt marsh restoration.",,,,,,,,,6,2,0,0,4,0,10,,,1559-2723,1559-2731,,,,,,,,,,"Ind Econ Inc, 2067 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02140 USANOAA, Restorat Ctr, SSMC3,Room 14720,1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USANOAA, Restorat Ctr, 5304 Flanders Dr,Suite B, Baton Rouge, LA 70808 USA",,,,2020-02-14,WOS:000511072800001,,

The main operational data requirements are fast turn-around time and frequent imaging to monitor the dynamics of the spill. Remote sensors on satellites and aircraft meet most of these requirements by tracking the spilled oil at various resolutions, over wide areas, and at frequent intervals.

This process is known as upwelling. Because upwelling is driven by winds, and winds are related to atmospheric conditions, upwelling is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. However, the potential impacts of climate change on upwelling and biology remain largely uncertain. In earlier work in the California Current upwelling system, off the west coast of the United States, researchers found that upwelling occurs in distinct winter and summer modes that have different impacts on biology. In this project, oceanographic and atmospheric data from the Benguela Current system, off South Africa and Namibia, will be analyzed for similar seasonal patterns and relationships with the ecosystem. Comparisons between these two upwelling systems will allow researchers to investigate if previous findings of regional climate impacts on biology are applicable at a global scale and consider how these systems may change in the future. The project will facilitate collaboration between researchers from South Africa, Namibia, and the United States, integrating a team of young and senior scientists from the three countries and providing them with opportunities for broad-scale scientific synthesis early in their careers. This project will be a comparative analyses of climate forcing and biological responses in the California Current (CCS) and Benguela Current systems (BCS), the two upwelling systems with the most similar time series of atmospheric and oceanographic conditions, seabird demography, and lower (chlorophyll) and mid (forage fish) trophic data. The project will determine whether changes in the ecosystems can be attributed to regional or global climate processes. Growth-increment chronologies from fish in the BCS (deep-water hake) will be developed as indicators of upper-trophic fish growth, and compared to rockfish growth chronologies developed in the CCS. Mid-trophic level fish abundance will be modeled as indices of prey availability for integration between climate and upper-trophic-level parameters. Oceanographic and atmospheric data will be analyzed from global observational and reanalysis data sets, as well as from earth system model projections of climate change. The project will address the following questions: 1) are seasonal upwelling modes (winter and summer) discernible in the BCS as they are in the CCS? 2) are upwelling modes forced by similar or contrasting atmospheric forcing mechanisms? 3) is there evidence of coherence/covariance among mid-trophic fish, upper-trophic fish, and seabirds (and at which lags) within and between the CCS and BCS? 4) will the positioning and amplitude of the atmospheric pressure systems that result in upwelling-favorable winds change coherently between ecosystems under various climate-change scenarios? and 5) what are the fisheries and wildlife management implications for variability in the seasonality and spatial distribution of upwelling in a changing climate?",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1434732,,,,,,,,University of Texas at Austin,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13911849,,

To date, 28 congresses have been held, now with a four-year interval; the 28th Congress was held in 1994 in Seville, Spain. PIANC has become a leading authority, particularly in the field of engineering. Several studies, for instance on the dimensions of ships and waterways and on signalling, have led to international standardization and PIANC congresses have often recommended further international studies of specific subjects. The congresses are each attended by approximately 900 participants from around 50 countries world-wide. They are state, municipal and harbour officials, consultants, scientists and academics at technical universities, contractors and many other participants from the navigation industry. There is a strong governmental influence in the organization, as the governments of about 40 countries support PIANC both financially and by the participation of senior civil servants.In the two sections of the congresses, inland navigation and ocean navigation, 10 subjects are discussed. PIANC has always followed recent developments such as trends in shipping, reception facilities for ferries, special arrangements for the handling of containers, oil, gas and of dangerous or environmentally noxious goods. Not only the technical aspects of navigation, such as canals, darns, ports and maritime structures, are discussed, but also economics, port management and port capacity and safety. Environmental aspects, for instance of maintenance dredging and the disposal of dredged materials, are important topics. PIANC has long been interested in coastal problems, as these affect ports. As many ports extend into the sea, PIANC has considered ocean engineering including artificial islands, maritime constructions, salvage and the removal of wrecks and navigation under arctic conditions. PIANC is also active in the field of sport and pleasure navigation. Since 1982 PIANC has organized international working groups to report on specific topics. At present there are about 35 active working groups and 23 reports have been published. Their members are from about 30 countries. They may convene several times each year or work by correspondence. The recommendations of the working groups represent recent advances and are widely distributed. For instance, the report Beneficial Uses of Dredging Material was presented for discussion to the London Dumping Convention. Membership of PIANC is open to organizations and individuals. In most countries a national section is the contact point for the members.

In the investigation stage, the Chang-Gong site was selected as the preferred site for the suitable geology condition and large storage capacity. Under the Chang-Gong preferred site, target aquifer underlying the recent overburden sediments consists of four key geologic formations, namely KCL, CS, CL, and TKS formations from bottom to top. These formations have been outlined based on extensive literal review and analysis of available geological data, the maximum depth is estimated approximately 3,000 m. Hence, prior to allocate a 3,000 m deep characterization well, the land seismic reflection survey is regarded as compulsory to testify the adequacy of required drilling depth. Six survey lines were distributed in the industrial park of the preferred site, the seismic data showed higher S/N ratio than expected. It may be due to the fact that only few human activities and rather low background noises of the preferred test site. The continuous operation of wind-power generator, ocean current and tidal wave resulted in no significant effects on the seismic data. Moreover, the saturated soil would also help the downward penetration of source energy with mini-vibe. For better interpretation of the seismic profiles, an auxiliary seismic survey had been conducted nearby a pre-existing deep well (WG-1) located 15 km away and south of the industrial park. The auxiliary seismic profile showed four extinct reflectors which match in sequence with the formation boundaries as revealed with the well log of the WG-1. The six seismic profiles obtained also showed four extinct reflectors, which correlated consistency with the profile obtained 15 km away. This seismic investigation showed the top of the target formations was in depth ranged from 2,200 m to 2,460 m. Based on the depth interpretation of the target geological formations, a preliminary planning on the drilling depth, well bore development scheme, and stability design can be done prior to allocate a 3000 m characterization well on-site.

Consequently, the temporal aspect of sedimentation has changed abruptly and can eventually cause long-term variations. These anthropogenic alterations should be precisely investigated in relation to sea-level rise (SLR) in order to mitigate unexpected consequences. To understand alteration of tidal asymmetry due to SLR, gamma parameters that combine the traditional tidal amplitude ratio of M-4/M-2 and phase-lag difference were evaluated using the ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) model under finely resolved complex coastal geometry. Moreover, tidal energy flux and dissipation changes, in relation to tidal-flat area, were examined in Gyeonggi Bay, South Korea. As a result of SLR, spatial change in tidal asymmetry would occur; moreover, gamma parameter intensity, which shows flood dominance, would attenuate. M-2 and M-4 tidal energy flux would be lessened by SLR. For the energy dissipation, slight change appeared in M-2, while lessening tidal flat area directly affected reduction in M-4 based on SLR scenarios. Because a small change in tidal asymmetry could yield long-term morphological changes in the macro tidal environment, these alterations should be treated as important. A numerical restoration test removal of Siwha Dike, which behaved as a tipping point on tidal asymmetry, revealed that even a SLR scenario did not have significant effect if the natural shoreline persists. Thus, future studies should be focused on the importance of long-term impact on tidal alteration induced by coastal construction.",,,,,14th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)14th International Coastal Symposium (ICS),"MAR 06-11, 2016MAR 06-11, 2016",Univ Sydney; Geocoastal Res Grp; Coastal Educ & Res Fdn; JCRUniv Sydney; Geocoastal Res Grp; Coastal Educ & Res Fdn; JCR,"Sydney, AUSTRALIASydney, AUSTRALIA",5,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Kunsan Natl Univ, Dept Ocean Sci & Engn, Kunsan, South Korea",,,,2016-04-20,WOS:000373241300008,,

This work investigates the possibility of developing a simple control oriented model of a de-oiling hydrocyclone based OIL experimental data that can support systematic analysis and control design of hydrocyclone systems. The most widely used control solution of a hydrocyclone is a Pressure Drop Ratio (PDR) control strategy, which is often empirically designed and experimentally tuned in a case-by-case manner. There is a lack of a systematic and deep-insight analysis of the capability, stability and limitations of these control solutions, as there are few control-oriented models available for de-oiling hydrocyclone systems. This paper proposes a method of retrieving a set of simple 1st-order transfer function models from a set of designed experiments based OIL a lab-scaled hydrocyclone System. Some preliminary results are also illustrated and discussed. The conclusion of this preliminary study is that the models obtained can emulate the dynamics of the system in a reasonable manner subject to the trade-off between simplicity and accuracy. In addition, higher order state space models are introduced and their relative advantage of depicting the complicated dynamics of the hydrocyclone's pressures is investigated.

Natural gas hydrates sequester an estimated one sixth of Earth's methane and are found primarily in deepwater marine sediments on continental margins, but also in permafrost areas and under continental ice sheets. When gas hydrate is removed from its stability field, its breakdown has implications for the global carbon cycle, ocean chemistry, marine geohazards, and interactions between the geosphere and the ocean-atmosphere system. Gas hydrate breakdown can also be artificially driven as a component of studies assessing the resource potential of these deposits. Furthermore, geologic processes and perturbations to the ocean-atmosphere system (e.g., warming temperatures) can cause not only dissociation, but also more widespread dissolution of hydrate or even formation of new hydrate in reservoirs. Linkages between gas hydrate and disparate aspects of Earth's near-surface physical, chemical, and biological systems render an assessment of the rates and processes affecting the persistence of gas hydrate an appropriate Centennial Grand Challenge. This paper reviews the thermodynamic controls on methane hydrate stability and then describes the relative importance of kinetic, mass transfer, and heat transfer processes in the formation and breakdown (dissociation and dissolution) of gas hydrate.

In this work, only the context of some design point key performance parameters and a limited set of collected operational data from the gas turbine in the real plant are available. Therefore, three major tasks, namely design point calculation, characteristic map tuning and off-design performance adaption, were needed to be performed. In order to check the validity of the proposed model, the obtained simulation results were compared with the operational data. The results indicate the maximum inaccuracy of the proposed model is 3.04 %. Finally, by employing the developed model, the engine capability for power generation when exposed to various load speeds is investigated. The obtained result demonstrates at the maximum gas generator speed, every 3 % decrease in mechanical speed leads to 1 % decline in the gas turbine power output. Moreover, when the gas turbine operates under design power load and mechanical speed is lower than 80 % of design speed, every 1 % decrease in load speed results in 0.2 % loss in thermal efficiency.

Both measurements are carried out at high frequencies, in the 10-50 MHz range, which makes the measurement insensitive to the type of oil and its dispersion, as well as polarization effects, while maintaining sufficiently large skin penetration depths. The sensor was demonstrated in laboratory tests as well as at the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement's (BSEE's) Ohmsett testing facility using mixtures of several crude and refined oils with water salinities in the 1-5% range. In all cases, the sensor provided a reliable oil content measurement with average errors of about 3% in a laboratory setting and about 7% during Ohmsett testing, which is sufficient for offshore oil recovery operations. Having this information will allow a responder to make on-the-spot adjustments to maximize recovery efficiency. In addition, the sensor will provide data on overall oil/water collection during a response. Other uses include oil and gas industry applications, where oil-water mixtures need to be evaluated for oil content or, equivalently, for water cut, and where high-water salinity prevents use of traditional sensors based on the dielectric principle alone.

There has been relatively little research on management of canals and spoil banks and this needs to be a significant component of restoration of the delta. We analyze research on the role of backfilling canals in the context of delta restoration with special reference to Turner and McClenachan (2018) who state that if all canals were backfilled, it could significantly reduce or even reverse wetland loss and that most wetland loss is caused by canals. We agree with Turner and McClenachan that canals have been a significant cause of wetland loss in the Mississippi Delta and that removing spoil banks and backfilling canals should be an integral part of delta restoration. However, a number of factors need to be considered when choosing which canals to backfill including possible enhanced erosion due to exposure to wave action for newly created and remnant marsh, the current and future production history of oil and natural gas wells associated with canals, and other restoration activities in oil and gas fields. Turner and McClenachan's analysis using wetland loss patterns in 15-min quadrangles suggesting that canal density can explain most wetland loss in coastal Louisiana is flawed because of scale problems and other impacts of oil and gas activity. These impacts include subsurface induced subsidence and the impact of produced water and toxins on wetlands that are largely unrelated to surface alteration due to canals and spoil banks.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,0,12,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USASoutheastern Louisiana Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Hammond, LA USAUS Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, 12100 Beech Forest Rd, Laurel, MD USA",,,,2019-10-22,WOS:000489190500043,,

Polar cod plays a key role in the Arctic marine ecosystem and is an important species for monitoring oil pollution in this region. We examined potential interactions of oil pollution and global warming by analysing liver transcriptome changes in polar cod exposed to crude oil at elevated temperature. Adult males and females were kept at high (11 degrees C) or normal (4 degrees C) temperature for 5 days before exposure to mechanically dispersed crude oil for 2 days followed by recovery in clean sea water for 11 days at the two temperatures. Genome-wide microarray analysis of liver samples revealed numerous differentially expressed genes induced by uptake of oil as confirmed by increased levels of bile polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites. The hepatic response included genes playing important roles in xenobiotic detoxification and closely related biochemical processes, but also of importance for protein stress response, cell repair and immunity. Though magnitude of transcriptome responses was similar at both temperatures, the upregulated expression of cyp1a1 and several chaperone genes was much stronger at 11 degrees C. Most gene expression changes returned to basal levels after recovery. The microarray results were validated by qPCR measurement of eleven selected genes representing both known and novel biomarkers to assess exposure to anthropogenic threats on polar cod. Strong upregulation of the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor 7 is proposed to protect the liver of polar fish with aglomerular kidneys from the toxic effect of accumulated biliary compounds. The highly altered liver transcriptome patterns after acute oil exposure and recovery suggests rapid responses in polar cod to oil pollutants and the ability to cope with toxicity in relatively short time.

The isotopic mixing model and a novel circular statistics rejected the influx of petrogenic carbon into the community and identified spatial consistencies such as the high contributions of microphytobenthos, food-chain length, and the isotopic niche of each feeding guild between sites. We suggested that high level of trophic plasticity and the prevalence of omnivory of consumers may promote the robustness of food web against the oil contamination.

After many decades, these compounds are still the topic of research activities in various multi-disciplinary fields, including chemical and petroleum engineering, earth and geophysics, chemistry and environmental sciences. This is not only due to the great impact that these compounds have on the oil and gas industry, but also to the potential applications they have in many evolving areas, including, but not only, natural gas storage and transportation, carbon dioxide sequestration, and sea-water desalination. It is generally accepted that gas hydrates represent the largest source of hydrocarbons on earth, something which has not been appreciated until only recently.Management, either prevention or application or both, of gas hydrates requires a complete knowledge and understanding of the formation, decomposition and inhibition mechanisms of gas hydrates, which in turn demands advanced experimental methods and instrumental techniques for gas hydrate characterisation. This paper reviews a broad range of techniques that have been used for natural gas hydrate characterisation. It includes the basic physical science principles of each method and the gas hydrate properties that each method is capable of detecting, including some modern instrumental analyses that enable direct determination of gas hydrate phases and possible measurement of molecular interactions within the fluid phases.

The C-POD, an acoustic sensor with an onboard automated click detector, has been deployed in diverse acoustic environments, but studies verifying its offshore detection rates and factors affecting detection probability are scarce. To empirically evaluate the performance of C-PODs in detecting bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), C-PODs were deployed alongside archival acoustic recorders 12-30 km offshore in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. The C-POD and acoustic recordings, post-processed using PAMGUARD software, were compared for a period of 6852 h. C-POD false positive rates were very low (mean 0.003%), and positive hourly detection accuracy was very high (mean 99.6%). Analysis of the acoustic environment and dolphin click characteristics revealed that true positive detections by C-PODs were significantly more likely to occur when PAMGUARD detected more clicks and there was increased high frequency noise (>20 kHz), likely from distant or unclassified clicks. C-PODs were found to be reliable indicators of dolphin presence at hourly or greater time scales. These results support the application of C-PODs in PAM studies that aim to investigate patterns of dolphin occurrence, such as those related to offshore windfarms.

SGS has advantages in terms of CAPEX, hydrocarbon losses, footprint, tonnage and power requirement compared to conventional solutions such as membrane. Even though the technology has been developed since 1989, the applications are limited to mainly dehydration and hydrocarbon dew pointing. For CO2 separation from natural gas, substantial development works are needed prior to the field application as there are a lot of uncertainties in the feed conditions to be tackled. In particular, the stringent requirements of cryogenic temperature, high pressure and inlet CO2 composition of its feed require a robust feed conditioning process plant. For a relatively new technology such as SGS for CO2 removal application, it is crucial to investigate and assess the variations of feed and process conditions i.e. temperature, pressure and gas compositions prior to being applied at actual field, as these will impact the CO2 separation performance inside the separator. Hence, this paper investigates the control strategies for the SGS feed conditioning plant subjected to +/- 15 % disturbances in temperature and pressure, and +/- 5 mol% variations in feed CO2 composition. Results show that effective disturbances elimination in the first flash separator of the feed conditioning plant is crucial in minimizing the impact to the SGS operation.

The intrinsic permeability of hydrate-bearing layers can potentially influence heat and pressure transfer during depressurization-induced NGH dissociation. By taking siltstone, sand and clay reservoirs in Shenhu area of South China Sea as examples, this study numerically investigates the effects of the magnitude and anisotropy of reservoir permeability on NGH production process and main physical field evolution. Results reveal that permeability anisotropy could impede advective interaction of fluids in vertical direction, significantly changing temperature and pressure evolution during NGH dissociation. Consequently, NGH dissociation slows down, delaying the coming of peak gas production rate. Some degrees of permeability anisotropy even lead to much earlier termination of NGH dissociation. In this case, the more permeable sand reservoir could possibly have a lower gas production potential than the less permeable siltstone and clay reservoirs. The permeable overburden limits the fluid pressure reduction and weakens the efforts of depressurization production. The re-production by further lowering well pressure only lasts for a short time. Comparatively, the depressurization of constant production mass rate is more effective but only provides a small contribution for the total gas yield. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

At present, few studies evaluated the combined impact of these stressors on fish physiology and behavior. Here, we tested the effect of the combination of hypoxia and petrogenic hydrocarbons on the anti predator locomotor performance of fish. Specifically, two groups of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were exposed to clean water (Ctrl) or oil-contaminated water (Oil). Subsequently, fish of both groups were placed in normoxic (norx) or hypoxic (hyp) experimental tanks (i.e. four groups of fish were formed: Ctrl norx, Ctrl hyp, Oil norx, Oil hyp). In these tanks, escape response was elicited by a mechano-acoustic stimulus and recorded with a high speed camera. Several variables were analyzed: escape response duration, responsiveness (percentage of fish responding to the stimulation), latency (time taken by the fish to initiate a response), directionality (defined as away or toward the stimulus), distance-time variables (such as speed and acceleration), maneuverability variables (such as turning rate), escape trajectory (angle of flight) and distancing of the fish from the stimulus. Results revealed (i) effects of stressors (Ctrl hyp, Oil norx and Oil hyp) on the directionality; (ii) effects of Oil norx and Oil hyp on maneuverability and (iii) effects of Oil hyp on distancing. These results suggest that individual stressors could alter the escape response of fish and that their combination could strengthen these effects. Such an impact could decrease the probability of prey escape success. By investigating the effects of hydrocarbons (and the interaction with hypoxia) on the anti-predator behavior of fish, this work increases our understanding of the biological impact of oil spill. Additionally, the results of this study are of interest for oil spill impact evaluation and also for developing new ecotoxicological tools of ecological significance.

The present study indicates the Atchafalaya River, fifth largest river in the United States in terms of discharge, traps 30mm/year of sediment on average within its floodplain, which is the highest average nonepisodic rate of fluvial deposition on the U.S. Coastal Plain. We installed sediment sampling stations at 23 sites, normally in transect, in the Atchafalaya Basin; these sites represent the range of hydrogeomorphic conditions on the floodplain based on hydrologic connectivity with the river main stem. The rate of sedimentation translates into about 12.5Tg/year and includes 694Mg/year of organic C. Highest sedimentation rates are associated with areas of high connectivity to channels and prograding deltaic processes. The C-13 content suggests that 35% of deposited C is derived from river-suspended sediment compared to litterfall in the basin. Thus, much of the organic C sequestered is allochthonous material. However, isolated interior sites with limited connectivity to the channel may generate and sequester large amounts of autochthonous C. The substantial trapping of both autochthonous and allochthonous C (392Mg/year) make this freshwater-forested floodplain critical in storage of material before reaching the coastal delta and estuary.

This process is known as upwelling. Because upwelling is driven by winds, and winds are related to atmospheric conditions, upwelling is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. However, the potential impacts of climate change on upwelling and biology remain largely uncertain. In earlier work in the California Current upwelling system, off the west coast of the U.S.A, researchers found that upwelling occurs in distinct winter and summer modes that have different impacts on biology. In this project, oceanographic and atmospheric data from the Benguela Current system, off South Africa and Namibia, will be analyzed for similar seasonal patterns and relationships with the ecosystem. Comparisons between these two upwelling systems will allow researchers to investigate if previous findings of regional climate impacts on biology are applicable at a global scale and consider how these systems may change in the future. The project will facilitate collaboration between researchers from South Africa, Namibia, and the U.S., integrating a team of young and senior scientists from all countries and providing them with opportunities for broad-scale scientific synthesis early in their careers. This project will be a comparative analyses of climate forcing and biological responses in the California Current (CCS) and Benguela Current systems (BCS), the two upwelling systems with the most similar time series of atmospheric and oceanographic conditions, seabird demography, and lower (chlorophyll) and mid (forage fish) trophic data. The project will determine whether changes in the ecosystems can be attributed to regional or global climate processes. Growth-increment chronologies from fish in the BCS (deep-water hake) will be developed as indicators of upper-trophic fish growth, and compared to rockfish growth chronologies developed in the CCS. Mid-trophic level fish abundance will be modeled as indices of prey availability for integration between climate and upper-trophic-level parameters. Oceanographic and atmospheric data will be analyzed from global observational and reanalysis data sets, as well as from earth system model projections of climate change. The project will address the following questions: 1) are seasonal upwelling modes (winter and summer) discernible in the BCS as they are in the CCS? 2) are upwelling modes forced by similar or contrasting atmospheric forcing mechanisms? 3) is there evidence of coherence/covariance among mid-trophic fish, upper-trophic fish, and seabirds (and at which lags) within and between the CCS and BCS? 4) will the positioning and amplitude of the atmospheric pressure systems that result in upwelling-favorable winds change coherently between ecosystems under various climate-change scenarios? and 5) what are the fisheries and wildlife management implications for variability in the seasonality and spatial distribution of upwelling in a changing climate?",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1434530,,,,,,,,University of South Carolina at Columbia,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13758962,,

Our goal was to assess how CAR changed over the lifespan of a salt marsh. We applied a geochronology to a series of salt marsh cores using both C-14 and Pb-210 markers to calculate CARs that were integrated between 35 and 2,460 years before present. CAR was 39 g C center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1) when integrated over millennia but was upward of 148 g C center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1) for the past century. We present additional evidence to account for this variability by linking it to changes in relative sea level rise (RSLR), where higher rates of RSLR were associated with higher CARs. Thus, the CAR calculated for a wetland should integrate timescales that capture the influence of contemporary RSLR. Therefore, caution should be exercised not to utilize a CAR calculated over inappropriately short or long timescales as a current assessment or forecasting tool for the climate change mitigation potential of a wetland.",,,,,,,,,20,1,0,0,10,0,25,,,2169-8953,2169-8961,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Beaufort, NC 28516 USAUniv N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",,,,2019-12-12,WOS:000500082100001,,

An understanding of the geochemical compositions of carbonate crude oils, grouped in families including heavy sulphur rich oils, light or mixed and biodegraded fluids helped to underline the different processes operating in the reservoirs today. The high degree of anoxicity during the organic matter deposition in the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous was confirmed. We observed low hydrocarbon cracking levels and non biodegraded fluids of Type II/IIS organic matter in Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous reservoirs, while shallower Tertiary reservoirs, although more mature were altered by microbial biodegradation.

Transportation corridors are present world-wide, and the vegetated filter strip and vegetated swale (VFS/VS), a common stormwater control measure, often constitutes the right-of-way (ROW) adjacent to roadways. The roadway environment, specifically carbon pools in North Carolina highway ROWs, were studied for carbon sequestration potential, an important ecosystem service. The study was conducted in two North Carolina physiographic regions: the Piedmont (characterized by clay-influenced soils) and the Coastal Plain (predominantly sandy soils). Approximately 700 soil samples were collected in VFS/VSs and wetland swales alongside major highways and analyzed for percent total soil C (% total C) and bulk density to obtain the C density. Mean soil C densities (per unit area) were 2.55 +/- 0.13 kg C m(-2) (mean +/- standard error, n = 160, 0.2 m sample depth) in the Piedmont and 4.14 +/- 0.15 kg C m(-2) (n = 160,0.2 m depth) in Coastal Plain highway VFS/VSs. Previous studies on grasslands had similar C density values to those observed in this study; thus, grasslands could be a surrogate land use for highway VFS/VSs. A thirty-seven year soil chronosequence characterized C accumulation in Piedmont VFS/VSs. Carbon density increases showed an association with age in Piedmont VFS/VSs only, which were calculated to reach maximum C density of 3.34 kg C m(-2), at age = 21.5 years. Previous studies on grasslands show similar C density and accumulation values to those observed in this study; thus, again grasslands could be a surrogate land use for highway VFS/VSs. Carbon density did not differ between dry or wetland swales, although % total C was significantly greater in wetland swales. The mean VS C density was 3.05 +/- 0.13 kg C m(-2) (n = 40, 0.2 m depth), while that for wetland swales was 5.04 +/- 0.73 kg C m(-2) (n = 44, 0.2 m depth).

Such characteristics can represent a combination of, e.g., heat source, pathway, trap and reservoir that all dictate how and where ore components are mobilized from source to deposition.

To quantitatively assess these risks, we need knowledge about both the vulnerability and sensitivity of the key Arctic functional groups that may be affected by spilled oil. However, in the Arctic these data are typically scarce or lacking altogether. To compensate for this limited data availability, we propose the use of a probabilistic expert elicitation methodology, which we apply to seals, anatids, and seabirds. Our results suggest that the impacts of oil vary between functional groups, seasons, and oil types. Overall, the impacts are least for seals and greatest for anatids. Offspring seem to be more sensitive than adults, the impact is greatest in spring, and medium and heavy oils are the most harmful oil types.

However, information on oil weathering processes and bioaccessibility of residual oil is often not sufficient and clear. In the present study, bioaccessibility of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-active polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in coastal sediments near the site of the Hebei Spirit oil spill (Korea, 2007) was assessed by Tenax extraction in effect-directed analysis (EDA). Sediment samples collected 6 years after the oil spill were extracted using Soxhlet or Tenax, and EDA was performed using a battery of H4IIE-luc bioassay and GC/MSD analysis. Concentrations of PAHs and alkyl-PAHs in Soxhlet extracts ranged from 210 to 53,000 mu g kg(-1) dry mass. However, concentrations of PAHs and alkyl-PAHs in Tenax extracts were approximately 20-fold less compared to those in Soxhlet extracts. In Soxhlet and Tenax extracts, the major AhR-active PAHs were identified as C1-chrysene, C3-chrysene, and C4-phenanthrene. Concentrations of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) equivalents (TEQ(PAHS)) explained 31% and 60% of the bioassay-derived TCDD-EQ concentrations in Soxhlet and Tenax extracts, respectively. Overall, bioaccessibility of PAHs and alkyl-PAHs in sedimentary residual oils depended on hydrophobicity (log K-ow) and degree of weathering of crude oil. The results of the present study provide further evidence in support of the biological and ecological recoveries of oil spill sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Incorporating vessel speed optimization into the supply vessel planning process may significantly reduce fuel consumption and hence emissions. In addition, speed optimization may yield cost reductions if the number of vessels used does not increase. A main uncertainty factor, especially in the winter season, is the weather conditions which impact sailing and service times. Cost minimization and the application of speed optimization strategies may have implications on the robustness of weekly supply vessel schedules since idle times in the schedules are reduced. We develop a simulation-optimization based methodology that considers costs, emissions and robustness in the generation of weekly supply vessel schedules. Results of analyses conducted on real instances show that robustness requirements may yield both increased emissions and costs in the winter season. However, depending on instance characteristics, different degrees of robustness can be incorporated with both costs and emissions reductions through speed optimization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydrocarbon exploration and development of these rocks has been going on for more than 50 years. Study of well logs and completion records of more than 6600 wells in north-central Oklahoma shows that the chat is widespread but not continuous and that chat reservoirs are very heterogeneous.The depositional environment and diagenetic alteration of the chat suggest it formed through a combination of uplift and either erosional detritus or weathering-in-place of Osagean Mississippian cherty limestone. Fossiliferous clasts found in chat cores were likely eroded in a high-energy environment such as that found above wave base in Mississippian shallow seas. The limestone clasts were transported by small-scale debris flows into a lower energy environment and deposited in a lime mud matrix. The chat-producing trend beginning in T25N, R3E in Osage County, Oklahoma, and extending eastward beyond the study area for about 20 mi suggests a relationship between probable shelf-edge erosion and the development of a chat reservoir. Other chat deposits formed from the weathering-in-place of Mississippian limestone on structural highs.Thin sections reveal that diagenesis resulted in partial replacement of calcite shells and cement with silica following the debris flow. Preserved original fossil structures suggest molecule by molecule silica replacement of calcite. Dissolution of remaining calcitic material, possibly by meteoric water, created secondary porosity and a potential hydrocarbon reservoir.The chat appears on well logs as a low-resistivity zone having low density and high porosity that, by normal interpretation methods, would calculate wet and nonproductive. Oil and gas produced from such zones are generally accompanied by salt water. Examination of drill cuttings can indicate whether the zone is highly porous or dense chert, with the former needed for a quality reservoir. Commercially productive zones generally have a minimum porosity of 25-30% and water saturations less than 80%. Micrologs provide indications of permeability that in core analysis is low (0.1 to 50 md; average < 20 md). Completion techniques should be designed for a siliceous reservoir containing detrital clays and no carbonate. Fracture treatment can generate additional permeability. Ultimate recovery from unitized fields having tens of wells ranges from 1 to 4 million bbl of oil and 1 to 3 bcf gas. Individual wells in good-quality reservoirs have produced more than 150,000 bbl of oil and varying amounts of gas from depths of 3000 to 5000 ft (914-1524 m).",,,,,,,,,32,3,0,0,0,0,63,,,0149-1423,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2001-01-01,WOS:000166716700006,,

The gas is being biodegraded as it migrates to the surface. The seeping gas is pervasive in the sediments above the diapir and clearly visible on shallow and deep seismic records and on wireline logs. An exploration well was drilled to test a Cretaceous Chalk reservoir above the diapir and provided an opportunity to sample the gas along the seepage pathway. Carbon isotope ratios of gases released from sealed cuttings taken from the gas cloud interval above the diapir were determined to test the hypothesis that biodegradation of leaking hydrocarbons produces secondary methane with a biogenic isotope signature.Generally high, but variable, concentrations of CO2 were detected all the way from the surface to the salt diapir. This results from biodegradation of hydrocarbons, and particularly oil. The source of oxygen for this process is problematic since most of the migration takes place through shales and there is no obvious aquifer source of dissolved oxygen.The effect of biodegradation of gases escaping from this structure results in a comparable increase in delta(13)C for both methane and ethane (up to 10 parts per thousand), with a lesser effect on propane and less still for butane and pentane. This conflicts with published data on such effects which suggest that methane and propane should be most affected, with little effect on ethane. Isotopically light methane was found only in the very deepest samples, within the salt of the diapir itself, and this is thought to be biogenic gas trapped in the salt at the time of deposition. No evidence was found that any ''secondary'' biogenic methane is being produced during gas seepage and biodegradation at this site.",,,,,3rd International Conference on Gas in Marine Sediments3rd International Conference on Gas in Marine Sediments,"SEP 25-28, 1994SEP 25-28, 1994",Netherlands Inst Sea ResNetherlands Inst Sea Res,"TEXEL, NETHERLANDSTEXEL, NETHERLANDS",41,7,0,0,3,0,45,,,0025-3227,,,,,,,,,,,"KINGSTON UNIV,SCH GEOL SCI,KINGSTON THAMES KT1 2EE,SURREY,ENGLANDSTATOIL AS,N-4035 STAVANGER,NORWAY",,,,1997-02-01,WOS:A1997WR72600008,,

Real world implementation can be found in both downstream and upstream branches. For example, at one end of the industry spectrum, service companies have started to use Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) for in-well temperature monitoring to optimize oil recovery processes. At the other end, pipeline operators have installed pipeline integrity monitoring systems based on Distributed Temperature and Strain sensing (DITEST) to fulfill realtime monitoring of soil stability, pipeline 3D deformation and leak detection.The use of OFDS for offshore structure integrity monitoring such as flow lines, risers and umbilicals has been qualified and field tested already whereas other applications such as performance rating of power umbilicals and enhanced flow assurance system using OFDS are being evaluated.Currently, the offshore full scale implementation of OFDS technologies still faces challenges of its own. In particular, sensor integration into the structure to be monitored is a minimum requirement which applies to any OFDS. If fiber optic is a common mean of data transmission, subsea conditions imply the use of specific components such as Wet Mate Connectors (WMC) and Fiber Optic Rotary Joints (FORJ). These components present large insertion and return loss characteristics for which OFDS require special attention to the OFDS system to comply with such characteristics. The effect of these components is twofold. First it impacts the sensor optical budget limiting its measurement range. Second, sensor sections remain completely blind due to the high reflection levels leaving the structure without status information over distances that can be as large as several kilometers.The present works describes how the DITEST based on Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) can overcome the limitations imposed by both WMC and FORJ components and fully comply with SURF monitoring requirements. The ability of the DITEST is justified theoretically and demonstrated experimentally through qualification trials involving hotspot detection while WMC and FORT are part of the sensor path. Their effects are quantified through the determination of the measurement dead zone (shorter than 4m), the temperature uncertainty and the resolution. The work also reports the subsequent installation on operational structures as these trials were successful. The DITEST has been installed to continuously monitor the temperature of a 3km long power umbilical and control the heating system of subsea rigid flowlines whose length can be as large a 45km.",,,,,"32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 09-14, 2013JUN 09-14, 2013","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Nantes, FRANCENantes, FRANCE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5535-5,,,,,,,,,"Omnisens SA, Morges, VD, Switzerland",Omnisens SA,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000360514000012,,

This study describes the identification, analysis and control of a low-dimensional control-oriented model of a lab-scaled slug testing facility. The model is analyzed and used for anti-slug control development for both lowpoint and topside transmitter solutions. For the controlled variables' comparison it is concluded that the topside pressure transmitter (P-t) is the most difficult output to apply directly for anti-slug control due to the inverse response. However, as P-t often is the only accessible measurement on offshore platforms this study focuses on the controller development for both P-t and the lowpoint pressure transmitter (P-b). All the control solutions are based on linear control schemes and the performance of the controllers are evaluated from simulations with both the non-linear MATLAB and OLGA models. Furthermore, the controllers are studied with input disturbances and parametric variations to evaluate their robustness. For both pressure transmitters the H-infinity loop-shaping controller gives the best performance as it is relatively robust to disturbances and has a fast convergence rate. However, P-t does not increase the closed-loop bifurcation point significantly and is also sensitive to disturbances. Thus the study concludes that the best option for single-input-single-output (SISO) systems is to control P-b with a H-infinity loop-shaping controller. It is suggested that for cases where only topside transmitters are available a cascaded combination of the outlet mass flow and P-t could be considered to improve the performance.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Aalborg Univ, Dept Energy Technol, DK-6700 Esbjerg, DenmarkNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2018-02-14,WOS:000423156900085,,

Dispersion effectiveness and droplet size distribution were measured after 5-120 min. A modeling method to predict the mean droplet size was introduced for the first time to tentatively elucidate the droplet size breakup mechanism. The ANS dispersion effectiveness greatly increased with dispersant and mixing energy. However, little CLB dispersion was noted at small energy input (epsilon = 0.02 Watt/kg). With dispersant, the ANS droplet size distribution reached quasi-equilibrium within 10 min, but that of CLB seems to reach quasi-equilibrium after 120 min. Dispersants are assumed ineffective on high viscosity oils because dispersants do not penetrate them. We provide an alternative explanation based on the elongation time of the droplets and its residence in high intensity zones. When mixing energy is small, CLB did not disperse after 120 min, long enough to allow the surfactant penetration.

The team worked aboard NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown from May 30 through June 9, and used remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to conduct a sophisticated documentation of the state of Titanic that was not possible in the 1980s. This Look, don't touch mission utilized high-definition video and stereoscopic still images to provide an updated assessment of the wreck site.The science team included Dr. Dwight Coleman of URI and the Mystic Aquarium & Institute for Exploration (MAIFE), who was the expedition's research chief. As the marine archaeologist with NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration, I oversaw the expedition's marine archaeology component. In addition to mapping the Titanic, expedition goals included the microbial research of scientist Roy Cullimore, who studied the natural deterioration of the ship's hull. Tiny microbes that feed on iron and create icicle-shaped formations called rusticles are responsible for this deterioration. While rusticles have been observed for many years, little is known about them.As the nation's ocean agency, NOAA has a vested interest in the scientific and cultural aspects of the Titanic, and in its appropriate treatment and preservation. NOAA's focus is to build a baseline of scientific information from which we can measure the shipwreck's processes and deterioration, and then apply the knowledge we gain to other deep-water shipwrecks and submerged cultural resources.The Guidelines for Research, Exploration and Salvage of RMS Titanic (9 pages, 104k) were issued under the authority of the RMS Titanic Maritime Act of 1986.On Monday, June 7, 2004, at 9 p.m. ET/PT, the National Geographic Channel gave audiences unprecedented access to the ongoing expedition by broadcasting a one-hour special, Return to Titanic External Link, which originated from NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown and included a live underwater telecast from the Titanic.Simultaneous with the expedition, MAIFE enabled thousands of children to experience the Titanic mission as it occurred. From June 4 through 9, four shows a day were transmitted live from the expedition via satellite and Internet2 to participating sites. The JASON Foundation for Education has created a new middle-school math curriculum called JASON Math Adventure: Geometry and Return to Titanic, which follows the work of researchers on the expedition. Students will learn how geometry concepts are used to position NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown at the Titanic wreck and the ROV Hercules on the Titanic's bow.Technology partners on the expedition included EDS of Texas, which wired the mission, and VBrick Systems of Connecticut, which enabled the mission feed to be broadcast nationwide.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-08,DRCI:DATA2020031018174882,,

The Delta is one of the most hydrocarbon rich regions in the world, where petroleum has been produced from the Agbada Formation by several oil companies. Oil and gas production has resulted in environmental degradation of the delta. In this study, a preliminary analysis of groundwater movement in the delta is performed to determine groundwater flow pathways, discharge and recharge areas, and average residence time of water movement through the flow systems. The USGS three-dimensional finite-difference code, MODFLOW, was used to simulate steady-state flow. No regional flow system occurred, and flow was concentrated in intermediate and local systems. A major discharge area was found that collects water from local flow systems in the coastal plains and from intermediate systems that originate from the mid topographic elevations.

VIVA employs a hydrodynamic database that has been benchmarked and calibrated against test data [1]. It offers relatively few input variables reducing the risk of user induced variability of results [2]. In addition to cross flow current induced standing wave vibration, VIVA has the capability of predicting traveling waves on a subsea riser, or a combination of standing and traveling waves. Riser boundary conditions including fixed, pinned, flex joint or SCR seabed interaction can be modeled using springs and dashpots. VIVA calculates riser natural frequencies and mode shapes and also has the flexibility to import external modal solutions.In this paper, the applicability of VIVA for the design of straked steel catenary risers (SCR) and top tensioned risers (TTR) is explored. The use of linear and rotational springs provided by VIVA to model SCR soil interaction and flex joint articulation is evaluated. Comparisons of the VIV fatigue damage output with internal and external modal solution is presented in this paper.This paper includes validation of the VIVA generated modal solution by comparing the modal frequencies and curvatures against a finite element (FE) model of the risers. Fatigue life is calculated using long term Gulf of Mexico (GoM) currents and is compared against the industry standard software SHEAR7. Three different lift curve selections in SHEAR7 are used for this comparison. The differences in riser response prediction by the two software tools are discussed in detail. The sensitivity of the VIVA predicted riser response to the absence of VIV suppression devices is presented in this paper. The riser VIV response with and without external FE generated modal input is compared and the relative merits of the two modeling approaches are discussed. Finally, the recommended approach for VIVA usage for SCR and TTR design is given.",,,,,"29th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering29th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 06-11, 2010JUN 06-11, 2010","ASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arctic Engn Div","Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,978-0-7918-4914-9,,,,,,,,,"2H Offshore Inc, Houston, TX USA",2H Offshore Inc,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000290917700079,,

Total nitrogen fixation rates increased 44 and 194 % at 30 degrees C in 4,000 mg kg(-1) tar ball and 10,000 mg kg(-1) moderately weathered crude oil treatments, respectively; however, there was no difference from the controls at 10 and 20 degrees C. Net nitrification rates showed production at 20 degrees C and consumption at 10 and 30 degrees C in all oil treatments and controls.

Close examination of profile data acquired in the Mississippi Sound, however, shows that the system can also detect certain conductive, polarizing objects that are buried beneath the sea floor and not discernible with conventional bathymetry. The streamer system is designed to detect polarizeable materials down to at least 6 meters below the sediment-water interface. The recent data show broad phase-shift (IP) anomalies along the east side of Cat Island, off the coast of Biloxi, MS. Dark, titaniferous sands can be seen in dissected benches and berms on the island's coastline, reinforcing the conclusion that the IP system is mapping the ilmenite-rich (FeTiO3) sediments reported in shoals there (Foxworth, 1962). Interspersed in these data, however, are several narrow electrical anomalies of two kinds: resistivity, and resistivity-IF anomalies. Both kinds show pronounced drops in the already-low resistivity, and several of these also have coincident phase-shift anomalies. The polarizing objects observed are similar to 10 to 20 meters across, but the IP anomalies can be seen similar to 20 to 40 meters laterally fi om their centers. The sources of these anomalies are probably man-made in origin, buried under a veneer of modem sediments.

Consequences for workers performing these activities without adequate measures of protection could result in adverse human health effects. Recent biodegradation studies in Africa have revealed the existence of exotic bacterial strains exhibiting unique and unusual PCB metabolic capability in terms of array of congeners that can serve as carbon source and diversity of congeners attacked, marking considerable progress in the development of effective bioremediation strategies for PCB-contaminated matrices such as sediments and soils in tropical regions.

Sediments near the sunken German WW2 submarine U-864, which according to historical documents included 67 tons of metallic Hg in its cargo, are enriched of Hg leaking from the wreckage. juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were exposed to two field-collected polluted sediments (U-864: inorganic Hg and Bergen Harbor (Vagen): inorganic Hg, PCB and PAH) or two comparable reference sediments for 5 weeks in the laboratory, and transcriptional responses evaluated in gills and liver. Gills of fish exposed to the Hg-enriched sunken WW2 submarine U-864 sediment contained four fold higher Hg levels compared to the control fish. An increase in Hg content in liver in the U-864 fish was also observed. The transcriptional results showed that calreticulin. HSP70 and heme oxygenase mRNA were significantly up-regulated in gills in fish exposed to the Hg-enriched sediments, whereas calreticulin, heme oxygenase, transferrin and WAP65 were significantly up-regulated and glutathione peroxidase 4B and zona pellucida 3 were significantly down-regulated in liver tissue. In gills and liver of cod exposed to the mixed-contaminated Vagen sediment, CYP1A showed the highest induction. In conclusion, the experiment shows that sediment-bound Hg is available to the fish and affects the transcription of oxidative stress responsive enzymes, suggesting that the Hg-enriched sediments may negatively affect the local wildlife. Furthermore, the mixed contaminated sediments of Vagen affected similar responses in addition to Ah-receptor mediated responses reflecting exposure to PAHs and PCBs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Although sonar methods have frequently been used in an attempt to detect buried wooden shipwrecks they are currently unable to indicate their degradation state. To assess the sensitivity of acoustic measurements to changes in the degradation state of such material, and hence the potential for sonars to quantify degradation, laboratory measurements of compressional wave velocity, as well as bulk density for oak and pine samples, in varying states of decay, were undertaken. These data enabled the calculation of theoretical reflection coefficients for such materials buried in various marine sediments. As wood degrades, the reflection coefficients become more negative, resulting in the hypothesis that the more degraded wood becomes, the easier it should be to detect. Typical reflection coefficients of the order of -0.43 and -0.52 for the most degraded oak and pine samples in sand are predicted. Conversely, for wood exposed to seawater the predicted reflection coefficients are large and positive for undegraded material (0.35 for oak, 0.18 for pine) and decrease to zero or slightly below for the most degraded samples. This indicates that exposed timbers, when heavily degraded, can be acoustically transparent and so undetectable by acoustic methods. Corroboration of these experimental results was provided through comparison with high resolution seismic reflection data that has been acquired over two shipwrecks.",,,,,,,,,21,2,0,0,1,0,26,,,0025-3235,1573-0581,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, EnglandNatl Museum Denmark, Dept Conservat Archaeol, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Natl Museum Denmark,,,2005-06-01,WOS:000233876500006,,

Previous studies have proposed dramatic changes in the global thermohaline circulation during glacial-interglacial cycles. Here, we present isotopic, geochemical and foraminiferal records from the core AI-3152 (water depth 3435 m). These data demonstrate shifts in the depth of northern- and southern-sourced deep water masses, as well as of foraminiferal lysocline in the Sao Paulo Plateau area, north-westward of the Vema Channel, in the western South Atlantic over the last 167 kyr. That the study area was bathed by southern-origin deep water masses during MIS 6, 4-2 and MIS 5.4-5.1, whereas a prevalence of northern-sourced waters is reconstructed for interglacials and MIS 5.5 and 1. Our data suggest that a carbonate saturation state associated with deep water ventilation, Antarctic air temperatures, ocean atmosphere gas exchange, Southern Ocean up-welling rates and likely productivity changes significantly affected the deep sea oceanographic conditions in the Sao Paulo Plateau area during glacials and MIS 5.4-5.1. A comparison of delta O-18(Cw) and delta C-13(Cw) recorded from core AI-3152 to other stable isotope records from the Rio Grande Rise, to the east of the Vema Channel clearly indicated the presence of a southern-derived analogue of dense Weddell Sea Deep Water at 3.4-4 km depth in the Vema Channel area during the MIS 3-2 interval. An approximately 500 m steeper W-E slope on the boundary of two southern-origin deep water masses was inferred on both sides of the Vema Channel during MIS 3-2.

To this end, the expert elicitation process was performed using the Delphi methodology. 5 main criteria and 29 sub-criteria were initially identified through a comprehensive literature review. During two rounds of Delphi questionnaires, the degree of importance and the degree of consensus values were identified for each individual parameter. According to the results achieved, selling the energy produced and tax incentives were rated as the most important factors with the highest degrees of consensus.

The total penguin population for the Falkland Islands has declined by 84% during the 1980s and 1990s. These declines did not occur in coastal South America, so potential causes of decline in the Falklands have been investigated. The suspected cause of decline is a reduction of fish and squid due to large-scale commercial fishing around the Falklands. Since 1995 rockhopper and gentoo populations have ceased declining, and appear to have reached a new equilibrium, albeit at a much lower level than before commercial fishing began. This has been matched by improved chick-rearing success and juvenile survival, however Magellanic penguins continue declining in the Falklands. Diet analysis shows that Magellanic penguins have a greater reliance on squid and fish species being taken commercially. In 1998 drilling for oil began around the Falklands, despite warnings that environmental protection was inadequate. Within a month the first of three separate oil spills occurred, killing and contaminating hundreds of penguins. The oil rig completed its drilling operations after five months and left the Falklands. Since then no further oil spills have occurred. Oil exploration is due to recommence in the near future, and environmental safeguards have not been improved. Ecotourism has increased rapidly over recent years in the Falklands, with penguins being the main attraction. Monitoring of the affects of tourism has concentrated on breeding success and population change, and the results indicate no detrimental affects on penguin populations at the current level. This paper investigates potential causes of penguin decline in the Falkland Islands, drawing comparison with populations in Chile which appear to be healthy. It concludes by calling on the Falkland Islands Government to exclude large-scale commercial fishing close to penguin breeding sites.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,20,4,24,,,0716-078X,0717-6317,,,,,,,,,,"Environm Res Unit, Stanley, Falkland Isl, Argentina",Environm Res Unit,,,2002-12-01,WOS:000180127200014,,

In this research, a development strategy is defined for tidal range projects based on geodynamics, civil engineering, and economics with the aim of assisting policy makers and industry. Criteria related to hydrodynamics, bathymetry, marine structure safety and cost recovery apply to relevant sites and to real data power prices. The case study described is that of the Bay of Bourgneuf on the French Atlantic coast, where a tidal range power plant of 900 MW could optimally be built with respect to sedimentation, water depth, and tidal coefficients. It has been determined that a 30 m-high artificial dam could maximise the harvestable energy (3 TWh). Numerical simulations show that a tidal plant sized at just 700 MW would be cost-efficient, due to the constraints of the grid and to high power curtailment rates (30%). The expected value of the Levelised Cost of Electricity would be around 200(sic)(2016)/MWh. Integration into the grid could be improved through addition of an innovative underwater energy storage system, rated to one third of the size of the tidal plant. The economics would improve (the LCOE would drop to 170(sic)(2016)/MWh) due to lower curtailment and to price arbitrage opportunities. Issues related to missing investor money (>3Bln(sic)(2016)) and unquantifiable positive externalities such as flood protection, energy independency, and clean energy provision are discussed, underpinning the need for regulator support.

The purpose of this paper is to identify academic discoveries that could provide offshore wind projects with means to overcome their current supply chain challenges.Design/methodology/approach - A comprehensive literature review was conducted involving 162 articles published in 29 peer-reviewed journals. The papers were analyzed in terms of the dimensions of SCI, research methodology, unit of analysis, level of analysis, type of industry and manufacturing environment being studied, integrative practices, integrative barriers and the link between SCI and performance.Findings - While SCI has been evolving to become an influential topic in the field of supply chain management, scholars have overlooked industrial contingencies by ignoring the differences between the studied industrial contexts, especially project-based manufacturing environments. The present review also reveals that no study of SCI has been conducted on the construction of renewable energy projects. Another finding is that case studies and research articles using networks as a unit of analysis are underrepresented.Originality/value - This is the first work to advocate for an industrial contingency approach in the analysis of SCI.

The authigenic carbonates are exposed along the Kardala and Alkolea sea cliffs in the western Pyrenees. The two vent carbonates occur 1 km apart adjacent to the synsedimentary, right-reverse Mutriku fault, but in contrasting structural domains: the Kardala carbonates occur on a structural ridge (hangingwall) and the Alkolea carbonates are positioned at the base of an erosional scarp (folded downward footwall). The similarity in pattern of the carbonate phases and complex paragenetic events for both vent precipitates implies that hydrothermal fluid generation processes and pore-water evolution during early and late diagenesis were similar. Nevertheless, a comparison of the geochemistry, fossil fauna and morphology of carbonate structures of both precipitates suggests that the vented hydrocarbon type, flow intensity and temperature of hydrothermal fluids were different. At the Kardala vent, intense focused flow of hot (up to 109 degrees C), oil-rich fluids were generated, allowing the development of a relatively abundant chemosynthesis-based fauna. In contrast, at the Alkolea vent, diffuse flows of warm, thermogenic methane-rich fluids were expelled to the sea floor and no chemosynthetic fauna developed. These differences are related to the contrasting structural setting of each locality. Similar delta C-13(org) values for both pyrobitumen-fills and host unit organic matter suggest that the hydrocarbon source was the Black Flysch Group. Contact alteration of these organic-rich sediments by syndepositional hydrothermal fluids generated hydrothermal petroleum (oil and gas hydrocarbons) which probably migrated updip to the sea floor by contemporary compression tectonics.",,,,,,,,,29,2,0,0,3,0,31,,,0037-0746,1365-3091,,,,,,,,,,"Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, Estratig Eta Paleontol Saila, E-48080 Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain",,,,2009-06-01,WOS:000265983700006,,

It lies in a WNW-ESE direction on the continental rise and abyssal plain, at a depth of between 4200 and 5200 m. It is formed by two depocenters elongated respectively south and north of the channel that show different sediment patterns. The area is swept by a deep western boundary current formed by AABW. The system has been previously interpreted has a mixed turbidite-contourite system. More detailed study of seismic data permits a more precise definition of the modern channel morphology, the system stratigraphy as well as the sedimentary processes and control.The modern CCS presents active erosion and/or transport along the channel. The ancient Oligo-Neogene system overlies a upper Cretaceous-Paleogene sedimentary substratum (Unit U1) bounded at the top by a major erosive late Eocene-early Oligocene discordance (D2). This ancient system is subdivided into 2 seismic units (U2 and U3). The thick basal U2 unit constitutes the larger part of the system. It consists of three subunits bounded by unconformities: D3 (Oligocene-Miocene boundary), D4 (late Miocene) and D5 (late Pliocene). The subunits have a fairly tabular geometry in the shallow NW depocenter associated with predominant turbidite deposits. They present a mounded shape in the deep NE depocenter, and are interpreted as forming a contourite drift. South of the channel, the deposits are interpreted as a contourite sheet drift. The surficial U3 unit forms a thin carpet of deposits.The beginning of the channel occurs at the end of U1 and during the formation of D2. Its location seems to have been determined by active faults. The channel has been active throughout the late Oligocene and Neogene and its depth increased continuously as a consequence of erosion of the channel floor and deposit aggradation along its margins.Such a mixed turbidite-contourite system (or fan drift) is characterized by frequent, rapid lateral facies variations and by unconformities that cross the whole system and are associated with increased AABW circulation.

Some of these effects, however, could be reduced with effective planning prior to development. The Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, in northeastern Alaska, USA, is an important maternal denning area for polar bears (Ursus maritimus). Recent legislation has opened the area for potential oil and gas development. As a result, there is interest in conducting winter seismic surveys across the area that could disturb denning female polar bears and lead to decreased cub survival. We sought to demonstrate how different seismic survey designs, with and without aerial den detection surveys, could affect the level of potential effect on denning polar bears during spring (Feb-Apr). We developed 5 hypothetical seismic survey designs for a portion of the Coastal Plain ranging from no spatial or temporal restrictions on activities to explicit consideration of when and where operations can occur. We evaluated how many dens might be disturbed by seismic surveys and the average distance activity came within simulated polar bear dens. Survey design had a large effect on the estimated number of dens that could be disturbed; the scenario with the highest spatial and temporal specificity reduced the number of dens disturbed by >90% compared to the scenario with no restrictions on when and where activity could occur. The use of an aerial den detection survey prior to seismic activity further reduced the number of dens disturbed by 68% across all scenarios. The scenario with the highest spatial and temporal specificity always had the lowest level of disturbance for all scenarios with and without the aerial survey included. Our study suggests that large reductions in the probability of disturbance can occur through careful planning on the timing and distribution of proposed activities even when surveys are planned in areas with a high density of polar bear dens.

Emissions pricing is being used to fund emissions-abatement technologies and to modify land management to improve carbon sequestration and retention. Here we discuss the principal land-management options under existing and realistic future emissions-price legislation in Australia, and examine them with respect to their anticipated direct and indirect effects on biodiversity. The main ways in which emissions price-driven changes to land management can affect biodiversity are through policies and practices for (1) environmental plantings for carbon sequestration, (2) native regrowth, (3) fire management, (4) forestry, (5) agricultural practices (including cropping and grazing), and (6) feral animal control. While most land-management options available to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions offer clear advantages to increase the viability of native biodiversity, we describe several caveats regarding potentially negative outcomes, and outline components that need to be considered if biodiversity is also to benefit from the new carbon economy. Carbon plantings will only have real biodiversity value if they comprise appropriate native tree species and provide suitable habitats and resources for valued fauna. Such plantings also risk severely altering local hydrology and reducing water availability. Management of regrowth post-agricultural abandonment requires setting appropriate baselines and allowing for thinning in certain circumstances, and improvements to forestry rotation lengths would likely increase carbon-retention capacity and biodiversity value. Prescribed burning to reduce the frequency of high-intensity wildfires in northern Australia is being used as a tool to increase carbon retention. Fire management in southern Australia is not readily amenable for maximising carbon storage potential, but will become increasingly important for biodiversity conservation as the climate warms. Carbon price-based modifications to agriculture that would benefit biodiversity include reductions in tillage frequency and livestock densities, reductions in fertiliser use, and retention and regeneration of native shrubs; however, anticipated shifts to exotic perennial grass species such as buffel grass and kikuyu could have net negative implications for native biodiversity. Finally, it is unlikely that major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions arising from feral animal control are possible, even though reduced densities of feral herbivores will benefit Australian biodiversity greatly.

In these projects, pipeline systems have been used, which are a cost-effective, safe, and reliable mode of hydrocarbon transport.For pipeline development in Arctic, several years of data need to be collected to support the pipeline design and construction planning, and may be required by regulations. Therefore, Arctic offshore pipeline projects generally require repetitive mapping surveys and geotechnical programs to verify design loads, soil properties, and thaw settlement potential.The major design loads that are considered for Arctic projects include ice gouging, strudel scour, upheaval buckling as well as thaw settlement. These issues can have a significant influence on the pipeline engineering considerations such as strain based design, target burial depth requirements, cost, and safety.While important to the design of the pipeline, these issues account for just a few of the many criteria that must be considered when routing a pipeline; criteria which can be categorized as either engineering, environmental, social, administrative, or infrastructural.The pipelines which are currently operational in the Arctic are located in shallow water depths and close to shore but were influenced by the unique Arctic environmental loading conditions. The experience from these past projects provides a significant base for the design, and operating of future offshore arctic pipelines.Pushing the limits to developments further offshore in deeper water will require that additional consideration be given to aspects related to pipeline design, in particular with respect to burial for protection against ice gouging.",,,,,"33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 08-13, 2014JUN 08-13, 2014","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn Div","San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4546-2,,,,,,,,,"INTECSEA Canada, St John, NF, CanadaINTECSEA, Houston, TX USA",INTECSEA CanadaINTECSEA,,,2014-01-01,WOS:000363497500006,,

Recent studies of source rock extracts and oil seeps show that in the Cenozoic sedimentary succession, particularly of Paleocene age, there are intervals with source rock characteristics appropriate for generation of liquid and gas hydrocarbons.Bulk parameters show a medium to highly paraffinic, non-waxy oil seeps with API between 12.69 degrees and 43.17 degrees, sulfur content varying between 0.1100 and 1.6501 wt %. The (TM) 13C isotopic composition of saturate fraction ranges between - 28.9 and - 22.2 parts per thousand, while the aromatic fraction has a range of - 28.80 to - 22.70 parts per thousand, and C.V. between - 5.55 and - 0.652, indicating non-waxy marine oils. Most of the samples analyzed by HRGC/FID and SIM-GC/MS in both whole oil and C15 + fractions showed a severe biodegradation process characterized by the total absence of n-alkanes and isoprenoids, the presence of an intense UCM, regular and aa-steranes in low concentration, and presence of 25-norhopanes.The saturated fraction in condensate and light oil seeps analyzed by GC/FID presents a unimodal distribution between n-C10 to n-C33 with n-C15 to n-C17 as the major peaks. CPI is close or slightly greater than 1.0, Pr/Ph ratio > 1.5 indicating an input of algal/microbial organic matter with a significant input of terrestrial matter. Biomarkers showed higher concentration of hopanes over tricyclic terpanes, Ts/Ts + Tm is > 0.25, O.I. ranges between 0.26 and 6.38 suggesting that the organic matter was deposited in a marine or marine deltaic environment during the Tertiary and/or Late Cretaceous. The C26TT/C25 TT ratio indicates both marine and non-marine organic sources. The alternate predominance of sterane distribution between C27- and C29-Steranes indicates that samples have marine, terrestrial or mixed characteristics. Diasterane/Sterane ratio suggests both a carbonate and siliciclastic lithology. Thermal maturity, according to the 20S/20S + 20R-C29 and aa/aa + aa-C29 steranes, adamantane and diamantane distribution and aromatic parameters, such as MPI, Rc, %, MNR, MPR, and MDBR indicate a low to moderated maturity.The results obtained indicate that additionally to the Late Cretaceous Cansona Formation, the Paleogene Arroyo Seco Formation could generate liquid hydrocarbons in the basin, and that the Neogene stratigraphic sequence is gas-prone. The presence of multiple potential source rocks for oil and gas generation in the basin open a new spectrum of exploration opportunities in conventional and unconventional petroleum systems associated with the Cenozoic, increasing the potential prospectivity of this under-explored basin.",,,,,,,,,9,1,0,0,1,1,9,,,0895-9811,,,,,,,,,,,"Antek SA, Geosci Technol Ctr, Calle 25B,85B-54, Bogota, ColombiaRA Geol, LSU Diagonal 54 27-33, Bogota, ColombiaHGA Ltd, Av 15 112-46,Off 104, Bogota, ColombiaNatl Hydrocarbon Agcy, Av Calle 26 59-65,2nd Floor, Bogota, ColombiaSouthern Methodist Univ, Geosci Dept, 6425 Boaz Lane, Dallas, TX 75205 USA",Antek SARA GeolHGA LtdNatl Hydrocarbon Agcy,,,2018-10-03,WOS:000444667900022,,

This is often explained in literature in terms of barriers in markets, institutions and organizations. This article is the first of a series of articles from a joint industry project aiming at understanding good energy management practices in shipping companies. It explores barriers to energy efficiency in shipping through a case study of a short sea shipping company in their process to implement an energy management system. An action research design was chosen to contribute to better practice as well as knowledge in the research community. The study shows that work with energy efficiency was not straightforward, and several challenge areas could be discerned: project management capabilities, ship-shore communication, division of responsibilities, access to performance measurements, and competence in energy efficiency. It is proposed that interpretative research methodologies such as action research could contribute to new perspectives on the traditional barrier discourse. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the proposed pipeline crossed below the trail by about six-hundred feet, it would require clearing of trees and plants along its length, drilling through a mountain, and constructing three compressor stations. Throughout the project's history, community and environmental groups opposed its construction. One coalition challenged different aspects of the pipeline permitting process under federal law and won a favorable U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit verdict. But the Supreme Court reversed an aspect of the Fourth Circuit's decision, holding that the U.S. Forest Service has the authority to grant a right-of-way on land crossed by the Appalachian Trail. However, even a Supreme Court win was not enough to save the project: the Atlantic Coast Pipeline was canceled shortly after it received a favorable decision from the nation's highest court.The showdown between Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Appalachian Trail exemplifies the tension between escalating U.S. oil and gas development and protecting spaces for recreational, scientific, cultural, and aesthetic uses. This Note argues the legislative and executive history behind the National Trails System Act of 1968 supports the protection of trails on federal lands, and the plain language of a statutory trio reserves to Congress the ability to grant oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way across national trails in the National Park System, such as the Appalachian Trail. In addition, this Note suggests an alternative framework for granting oil and gas pipeline rights-of-ways across national trails both in and outside the National Park System. Given that national trails were created to offer an escape from development and industry, oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way should only be granted across national trails on federal lands if no prudent and feasible alternative exists. By limiting oil and gas pipeline development on national trails, such trails may be preserved for future users, untrammeled and undisturbed, as escapes.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0046-1121,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Boalt Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,,2021-09-18,WOS:000686407300006,,

During 20 days of incubation at 5 degrees C, CO2 evolution, hydrocarbon concentrations and the microbial community composition were determined. Approximately 60% to 25% of the dissolved oil with or without COREXIT, respectively, was degraded, in addition to some hydrocarbons in the COREXIT. FeCl2 addition initially increased respiration rates, but not the total amount of hydrocarbons degraded. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a succession in the microbial community over time, with an increase in abundance of Colwellia and Oceanospirillales during the incubations. Flocs formed during incubations with oil and/or COREXIT in the absence of FeCl2. Synchrotron radiation-based Fourier transform infrared (SR-FTIR) spectromicroscopy revealed that the flocs were comprised of oil, carbohydrates and biomass. Colwellia were the dominant bacteria in the flocs. Colwellia sp. strain RC25 was isolated from one of the enrichments and confirmed to rapidly degrade high amounts (approximately 75%) of the MC252 oil at 5 degrees C.

Hydraulic fracturing is a potentially promising stimulation technology for such low-permeability reservoirs. Here, we assess the gas production potential of a depressurization horizontal well that is assisted by the hydraulic fracturing using numerical simulation according to field data at site SH2 in this area. In addition, the number of horizontal wells drilled is discussed if commercial production is to be performed at this site. The results show that the production potential can be significantly stimulated at the early production stage by adopting hydraulic fracturing in this reservoir due to a better depressurization effect. However, the increase in gas recovery gradually decreases with the continuous dissociation of gas hydrates, and the evolution trend is similar to that in a reservoir without stimulation during later periods of gas production because the dissociation front gradually moves away from the fractures. From the perspective of production potential, using a horizontal well scheme assisted by the hydraulic fracturing technology for gas recovery from a hydrate deposit can sharply reduce the number of operation wells, shorten the drilling operation time, and boost the economic efficiency. The horizontal well scheme may be an effective way to increase the gas yield if the application of quickly deployed horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing techniques in such hydrate reservoirs greatly increases in the near future.",,,,,,,,,80,12,0,0,1,0,90,,,2050-0505,,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Geosci, Fac Engn, Natl Ctr Int Res Deep Earth Drilling & Resource D, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R ChinaCent S Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Metallogen Predict Nonferrous Met & Geol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R ChinaQingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Mineral Resources, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaMinist Land & Resources, Qingdao Inst Marine Geol, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China",,,,2019-08-01,WOS:000479313100005,,

These estimates are at least five times greater than the previous estimate made by the Australian Government (about 27.8 tC/ha). There are 2.1 million ha of protected Melaleuca forest which likely stock between 328 M tC and 601 M tC; equivalent to between 2.7% and 5.0% of total carbon storage of all Australian native forests.

It can contribute to policy objectives on climate change, energy security, green growth and social progress. However, the large potential of offshore wind does not automatically lead to a large share in future energy systems; neither does the emergent stage of development of the technology. Recent insights in innovation studies suggest that the success chances of technological innovations are, to a large extent, determined by how the surrounding system the innovation system is built up and how it functions. In this paper we assess the offshore wind innovation systems of four countries: Denmark, the UK, the Netherlands and Germany with the objective to provide recommendations for strengthening the overall European offshore wind innovation system. We use the Technological Innovation System (TIS) approach to analyse the system in 2011. Based on the analysis we identify a number of challenges that the European offshore wind sector faces. Some of them include: a serious deficiency of engineers; fragmented policies and poor alignment of national regulatory frameworks; cost of the technology and limited grid infrastructure. Since the problems hinder the entire system development we call for a systemic policy instrument that would support the innovation system around this technology and contribute to its wider diffusion in Europe.

Time series of hydrocarbon mass, carbon content, n-alkanes, PAHs, and fluorescence indicate that the decomposition of golf-ball-size DWH-SOAs embedded in beach sand takes at least 32 years, while SOA degradation without sediment contact would require more than 100 years. SOA alkane and PAH decay rates within the sediment were similar to those at the beach surface. The porous structure of the SOAs kept their cores oxygen-replete. The results reveal that SOAs buried deep in beach sands can be decomposed through relatively rapid aerobic microbial oil degradation in the tidally ventilated permeable beach sand, emphasizing the role of the sandy beach as an aerobic biocatalytical reactor at the land-ocean interface.",,,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,21,1,32,,,2045-2322,,,,,,,,,,,"Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, 117N Woodward Ave, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USAGeorgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, 310 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USAGeorgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, 310 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USAGeorgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",,,,2019-07-24,WOS:000474821000017,31296898,

Excess Barium (Baxs) fluxes from ODP 1240.Reconstructions of past changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations in the abyssal ocean are of interest to paleoceanographers because of their potential to help characterize and quantify the transfer of carbon between the atmosphere and the deep ocean. This potential, derived from the stoichiometric relationship between oxygen consumption and the regeneration of organic matter, has recently been expanded by compilations of core top observations for two proxies, the deltaC gradient between coeval infaunal and epifaunal benthic foraminifera (DeltadeltaC), and biomarker preservation. Here, we review these newer proxies, and the more established redox proxy authigenic uranium (aU), to critically evaluate our understanding of the controls on proxy production and preservation. We locate our work in the equatorial Pacific, presenting both new data and a compilation of existing records based on thirty-two sediment cores to draw semi-quantitative conclusions about bottom water oxygen and respired carbon concentrations over the last glacial period. We find that the biogeochemical limitations on these proxies may be more substantial than previously appreciated, and therefore suggest several best practice recommendations for their application. Despite the recognized data limitations, the compilation identifies the glacial Pacific Ocean as a dominant sink for CO₂ at all depths below the modern oxygen minimum zone. Our review emphasizes the importance of multiproxy reconstructions, informed by site-specific records of paleoproductivity, in drawing coherent, internally consistent conclusions about glacial ocean oxygenation and carbon storage.

This problem may be solved by using different methods of optical spectroscopy, including: center dot Raman scattering; center dot light induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS); center dot fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) LIDARs are successfully used for remote sensing of chemical and biological substances at atmosphere. A new laser induced fluorescence (LIF) KA-14 LIDAR system for detecting of oil spills on the sea surface was employed at the National Aviation Academy of Azerbaijan. LIDAR's parameters are as follows: center dot laser CFR 200-type QUANTEL, lambda = 355 nm, beam circle divide = 5.35 mm, f = 20 Hz, pulse duration tau = 7 ns, pulse power 60 mJ; center dot diameter of Newtonian-type telescope is 200 mm; center dot collimator expansion of the laser beam diameter-not less than 3; center dot angle range of telescope measurements relative to horizon: from -20 to +20 degree; center dot spectral range of measurements: from 380 to 750 nm, number of spectral channels-32; center dot maximum range of measurements-not less than 250 m. This LIDAR is the first performing these kind of research not only on the Azerbaijan beach of Caspian sea, but also on the earth places of Absheron peninsula, where oil-gas production takes place.

Existing data delivery protocols for such AUV equipped networks are designed in a way where AUVs act as message ferries. These UASNs are deployed for a specific service such as asset (e.g., oil pipes, shipwreck) monitoring and event detection. For a coordinated data collection, to deploy a network for any service like information discovery in an ad hoc manner, it requires a 3D UASN consisting of only AUVs and the movement of an AUV needs to be controlled by another AUV through commands. To our knowledge, no such data delivery protocol required for a 3D UASN comprising only AUVs exists in the current literature that can efficiently handle data collection and delivery. To address this research gap, in this paper, an AUV-based technique for ad hoc underwater network, namely AUV-based Data Delivery Protocol (ADDP), is introduced which ensures data delivery within a given time-constraint by controlling node (i.e., AUV) movement at each hop through commands of a node. The performance of the proposed protocol has also been evaluated and compared with existing relevant protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio, routing overhead and energy consumption considering various network scenarios and sizes. Results exhibit outstanding performance improvement achieved by the proposed protocol for all metrics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Under such circumstances, oil and gas are processed in Floating Production Storage and Offloading rigs, whose topside facilities are limited in terms of weight and footprint of equipment. Energy demands, supplied by on-site generation, also reduce the availability of space and weight to oil and gas processing. This work evaluates carbon dioxide separation alternatives applicable to this challenging scenario in terms of technical, economic and environmental aspects, considering early enhanced oil recovery as the destination of carbon dioxide. The Brazilian Pre-Salt fields are used as case study due to their unusual high capacity gas processing on the production topside, a consequence of the high gas to oil ratio and carbon dioxide content. The set of studied carbon dioxide separation technologies encompasses membrane permeation, chemical absorption by aqueous methyl diethanolamine with piperazine, physical absorption with propylene carbonate and hybrid variants physical absorption and membranes, membranes and chemical absorption, and two stages membrane, technically assessed by process simulation. Due to the continuous injection of carbon dioxide to enhanced oil recovery, the reservoir content of carbon dioxide increases along production life-cycle, which means that the performances of technologies have to be compared under short-term, mid-term and long-term carbon dioxide content in the associated gas, respectively, of 10%, 30% and 50% (mol), for gas production of 6 million sm(3)/d. Chemical absorption exhibits the lowest hydrocarbon losses and the lowest specific electric power consumption at the expense of the highest footprint, for all investigated scenarios. The lowest life-cycle costs are for chemical absorption and two stages membrane, respectively $0.57 and $0.46 million/GJ of exported gas, while the largest cost belongs to the hybrid membrane and chemical absorption ($1.78 million/GJ of exported gas). Chemical absorption holds the lowest carbon dioxide emission per ton of injected carbon dioxide (0.15 t/t), seconded by membrane permeation (0.19 t/t). Hybrid membrane and chemical absorption inherits the small footprint of membrane permeation and, despite its highest life-cycle cost, is recommended for flexibility reasons due to increasing carbon dioxide content in the reservoir life-time in cases of ultra-deepwater fields with high gas to oil ratio, high carbon dioxide content and early carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery. Contrarily to the widely acceptance of membrane permeation as a leading small footprint solution, the overall performance analysis, under the adopted premises, remarkably favors chemical absorption.

Climate models indicate that changes to the AMOC both herald and drive climate shifts. Intensive trans-basin AMOC observational systems have been put in place to continuously monitor meridional volume transport variability, and in some cases, heat, freshwater and carbon transport. These observational programs have been used to diagnose the magnitude and origins of transport variability, and to investigate impacts of variability on essential climate variables such as sea surface temperature, ocean heat content and coastal sea level. AMOC observing approaches vary between the different systems, ranging from trans-basin arrays (OSNAP, RAPID 26 degrees N, 11 degrees S, SAMBA 34.5 degrees S) to arrays concentrating on western boundaries (e.g., RAPID WAVE, MOVE 16 degrees N). In this paper, we outline the different approaches (aims, strengths and limitations) and summarize the key results to date. We also discuss alternate approaches for capturing AMOC variability including direct estimates (e.g., using sea level, bottom pressure, and hydrography from autonomous profiling floats), indirect estimates applying budgetary approaches, state estimates or ocean reanalyses, and proxies. Based on the existing observations and their results, and the potential of new observational and formal synthesis approaches, we make suggestions as to how to evaluate a comprehensive, future-proof observational network of the AMOC to deepen our understanding of the AMOC and its role in global climate.",,,,,,,,,114,0,0,0,18,0,119,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, EnglandUniv Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, Cape Town, South AfricaUniv Hamburg, Inst Oceanog, CEN, Hamburg, GermanyUniv Southampton, Southampton, Hants, EnglandConsejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, ArgentinaServ Hidrog Naval, Buenos Aires, DF, ArgentinaUMI IFAECI CNRS, Buenos Aires, DF, ArgentinaScottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban, Argyll, ScotlandNatl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USAAtlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL USAUniv Rhode Isl, Narragansett, RI USAUniv Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USAUniv Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Oden Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USAGEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, GermanyMet Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, EnglandUniv Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USADuke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USACNRS, Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale, Plouzane, FranceWoods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USABremen Univ, Ctr Marine Environm Sci MARUM, Inst Environm Phys IUP, Bremen, GermanyMIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USADept Environm Affairs, Cape Town, South AfricaMaynooth Univ, Dept Geog, ICARUS, Maynooth, Kildare, IrelandCNRS, Lab Meteorol Dynam, UMR Ecole Polytech 8539, ENS, Paris, FranceNatl Oceanog Ctr, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",UMI IFAECI CNRS,,,2019-06-07,WOS:000470790900001,,

The fauna and palynoflora of the formation suggest a terrestrial environment of deposition; there is no evidence of marine influence. The strata indicate a relatively shallow lacustrine environment with an associated fluvial deltaic sequence. The preservation of palynomorphs in subsurface core samples from the lower member and middle oil shale member of the formation (Dawson Settlement and Frederick Brook Members, respectively) varies from very poor to very good, whereas preservation of palynomorphs in outcrop samples from the upper member (Hiram Brook Member) is very good. The poor preservation is probably the result of deposition under anoxic conditions, with subsequent growth of pyrite on the exines; corrosion by microorganisms such as anaerobic bacteria or fungi may also have occurred. No significant qualitative taxonomic variations were discernible in the palynoflora vertically throughout the formation. Quantitatively, most samples are dominated by Punctatisporites irrasus Hacquebard and P. planus Hacquebard; Spelaeotriletes pretiosus (Playford) Neves and Belt is common to abundant in two of the Hiram Brook samples. Dominance of a few species may indicate an arid climate consistent not only with Atlantic Canada's position of low latitude in the various paleocontinental reconstructions for the Early Carboniferous, but also with the local presence of evaporites in upper beds of the Albert Formation. Comparison with assemblages from the Horton Group of Nova Scotia favors a correlation with the Horton Bluff Formation. The Albert Formation assemblages may be correlated with the Spelaeotriletes pretiosus-Raistrickia clavata (PC) Spore Zone of Tournaisian, late Tn2 to early Tn3, age of western Europe. The organic matter consists of significant amounts of algae (Botryococcus sp.) along with exinous, woody, and coaly fragments. The spores are yellow-orange to orange-brown, indicating a Thermal Alteration Index (on a five point scale) of 2- to 2+.

The technical challenges relating to accurate geo-positioning of these systems and examples of co-registration results are discussed in [1]. Additionally, our research includes development of a vertically-integrated suite of platforms exploiting common data acquisition, data processing and data analysis tools. The presented marine survey platforms are compatible with low-altitude helicopter systems and ground-based vehicular systems used for terrestrial UXO detection. Cross-platform system compatibility maximizes deployment efficiency through use of the Geophysical Data Center (GDC) technology. The GDC is a comprehensive set of web-enabled data handling, data processing, data analysis, and quality control (QC) tools. Developed over the last 10 years, the GDC has facilitated centralized control of over 100 remotely executed projects. The GDC standardizes procedures-improving quality and reliability at reduced costs.

On the other hand, multifunction ships such as offshore support vessels, anchor handling and towing vessels, naval vessels and wind farm construction and support vessels require fast and accurate manoeuvring and need highly reliable systems to support reduced or no crew. Diesel mechanical propulsion with controllable pitch propellers provides high efficiency and low CO2 emissions, but has traditionally been poor in manoeuvrability, can suffer from thermal overloading due to manoeuvring and requires significant measures to meet NOx and PM emission regulations. The control strategy of diesel mechanical propulsion with fixed combinator curves is one of the causes of the poor manoeuvrability, thermal overloading and cavitation noise during manoeuvring, such as slam start and intermediate acceleration manoeuvres. This paper proposes an adaptive pitch control strategy with slow integrating speed control that reduces fuel consumption, CO2, NOx and PM emissions and underwater noise, improves acceleration performance, limits engine loading and prevents engine under- and overspeed. A simulation study with a validated model of a case study Holland class Patrol Vessel demonstrates 5-15% reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, compared to the baseline transit control mode in the ship speed range from 6 to 15 kts, during constant speed sailing. Moreover, the adaptive pitch control strategy reduces acceleration time from 0 to 15 kts with the slam start procedure by 32% compared to the baseline manoeuvre control mode and by 84% for an intermediate acceleration from 10 to 15 kts, while preventing thermal overloading of the engine, during straight line manoeuvres. Combining this control strategy with hybrid propulsion, running an electric drive in parallel with the propulsion diesel engine, can potentially further reduce fuel consumption at low speeds while also improving acceleration performance even more. Therefore, hybrid propulsion plants with controllable pitch propellers and adaptive pitch control can provide a significant contribution to the urgent reduction of environmental impact of shipping and to the need for more autonomous and reliable ship systems.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,0,14,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,,,,,,,"Delft Univ Technol, Dept Maritime & Transport Technol, Delft, NetherlandsNetherlands Def Acad, Fac Mil Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands",Netherlands Def Acad,,,2019-01-04,WOS:000453489800106,,

Joseon government exploited the first maritime route of envoy journey to make two Ming envoys Liu Hongxun(劉鴻訓) and Yang daoyin(楊道寅) return to China and to send Joseon envoys Choe Eungheo(崔應虛), An Gyeong(安璥), Kwon Jingi(權盡己) and Ryu Yeohang(柳汝恒) to China. Joseon government constructed two ships imminently for the convenience and safety of Ming envoys and mobilized many people to escort them and seamen to make a fleet in large scale which amount to 22 vessels.The maritime route was starting from Anjoo(安州) of Pyeongyang Province(平安道) through sea area of southern Liaodong(遼東) to Dengzhou(登州) of Shandong(山東). However, the fleet met with disaster in a large scale due to the lack of experience and unusual weather. Nine vessels were wrecked by a intense storm and they lost many people and many goods were damaged. Liu Hongxun, Choe Eungheo and Kwon Jingi escaped narrowly just before wrecking.Ming envoys felt confidence toward Joseon envoys who in charge of the journey more and more as maritime journey carried on.

The most relevant security threats the companies fear, include hijacking of vessels (sea piracy), but also terrorism, and wars. Finally, the study highlights that the European Union has built a comprehensive portfolio of strategies to deal with scarcity of oil and gas resources. However, these approaches are not often synchronized with supply chain strategies.Practical implications - The paper provides guidance for supply chain managers dealing with critical suppliers located in conflict environments. The paper recommends that supply chain managers fine tune their strategies in coordination with governmental actions in foreign politics, dependence reduction and crisis management. This may be achieved by closer communication with governments and potentially through the creation of a pan-European sector alliance.Originality/value - Previous research discusses the topic of supply chain resilience and supply chain risk management. However, none of these studies report on exogenous security threats and disruption strategies of oil and gas supply chains.

Without treatment, the discharge of these streams into the environment would lead to considerable environmental problems. A combination of physicochemical and biological treatment processes are applied to treat such polluted streams (e. g., in conventional water purification plants). However, the application of microorganisms in these streams is rather limited streams to salt levels well below those of seawater. The potential of microorganisms to degrade various organic and inorganic pollutants at higher salinities was surveyed in the open literature. The advantage of biological treatment processes that operate at elevated salinities is that no dilution water is needed, which is particularly relevant for arid regions. The available literature is scarce, especially concerning truly halophilic bacteria that thrive at salt concentrations significantly higher than in seawater. The obvious trend of most of the publications indicates a significant inhibition of the biodegradation activity at salt concentrations above 10 wt.%. However, a specialized group of extremophilic microorganisms, called halo(alkali)philes, could replace freshwater or marine organisms in the biodegradation processes at salinities above 1.5 M and pH values above 9. They are present in natural hypersaline habitats and can be activated either directly in situ by addition of micronutrients and aeration, or introduced into engineered water treatment systems. In a number of studies, the possibility of microbial HC degradation up to 5 M NaCl has been mentioned. Relatively little is known about the removal of toxic inorganic compounds, such as H2S, CO, and CN-, at halo(alkaline) conditions. These compounds are clearly associated with the processing of oil, coal, and gas. An exception is the application of sulfur-cycling bacteria, as these organisms have been intensively studied during the last decade. Sulfur-oxidizing and sulfidogenic bacteria can function efficiently at extremely saline and alkaline conditions. The general conclusion from this survey is that many biodegradation routs are, in principal, possible at high salt/pH but more research is needed to make a real progress in the development of engineered processes that can be applied to protect the environment.",,,,,,,,,32,1,0,0,24,0,36,,,1064-3389,1547-6537,,,,,,,,,,"Delft Univ Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Delft, NetherlandsWinogradsky Inst Microbiol RAS, Moscow, RussiaShell E&P, NL-2288 GS Rijswijk, NetherlandsWageningen Univ, Subdept Environm Technol, Wageningen, Netherlands",,,,2012-01-01,WOS:000301524600001,,

In the second study, 24 hr of observations (in vivo and video) of drillers managing a high fidelity well-control simulator were analyzed to further develop the framework.Results: The cognitive components that enable drillers to build up an understanding of what is happening in the wellbore and surrounding environment, to predict how this understanding may develop, were identified. These components included cue recognition, interpretation of information in conjunction with the current mental model, and projection through mental simulation. Factors such as distracters, expectations, and information sharing between crew members can both positively and negatively influence the drillers' SA.Conclusion: The findings give a preliminary understanding into the components of drillers' SA, highlighting the importance of SA for safe and effective performance and indicating that Endsley's model of SA can be applied to drilling.Application: The results have consequences for training, task management, and work design recommendations.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,0,18,,,0018-7208,1547-8181,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB24 2UB, ScotlandUniv Aberdeen, Chair Appl Psychol, Aberdeen AB24 2UB, ScotlandUniv Aberdeen, Chair Med Educ Res, Aberdeen AB24 2UB, Scotland",,,,2015-06-03,WOS:000354563500004,25977320,

On the basis of discharge volume, this type of contaminated water is the largest contributor to the offshore waste stream. Modeling studies of large amounts of wastewater discharge into offshore areas have helped in the understanding of pollutant dispersion behaviors in marine environments and in further evaluating the potential environmental effects resulting from produced water discharges. This study presents an integrated three-dimensional (3D) approach for the simulation of produced water discharges in offshore areas. Specifically, an explicit second-order finite difference method was used to model the far-field pollutant dispersion behavior, and this method was coupled with the jet-plume model JETLAG with an extension of the 3D cross-flow conditions to simulate the near-field mixing processes. A dynamic coupling technique with full consideration of the interaction between the discharged fluids and receiving waters was employed in the model. A case study was conducted on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, Canada. The field validation of the modeling results was conducted for both the near-field and far-field dispersion processes, and the modeling results were in good agreement with the field observations. This study provides an integrated system tool for the simulation of complex transport processes in offshore areas, and the results from such modeling systems can be further used for the risk assessment analysis of the surface water environment.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,,,,,,,"Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, CanadaFisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada",,,,2013-03-20,WOS:000314675500034,23268698,

The archaeological remains have been used as one of indicators to interpret the recent movements, uplift or subsidence, long the coastal tracts of the island; the evidences are represented by quarries, megalithic buildings, submerged towns, roman villas, the latter by harbor structures, Medieval testifies and other ruins like the wrecks for a long span. In summary, the comparison between the geomorphologic evolution, archaeological indicators and radiometric data suggests a different sea-level uplifting corresponding to the different Pleistocenic evolution in some places of the island; in some cases there is an evident correspondence between the submerged remains and the presence of the grabens that characterizing the geological structure of the Sardinia. The submerged archaeological indicators are intended to identify the level of the sea, in most situation, they indicate the presence of a sea level lower than their base subject to the tidal range at the time which can be only be approximate. However, the presence of a single type of indicator does not know the precise level of the sea; in the same way it is very difficult to distinguish between eustatic and tectonic components. The combination and correlation between different data at the regional level is the only possibility to have an interpretative hypothesis for movements. Unfortunately it is rare to have all three indicators in one place. The results are given in recognition of areas of greatest subsidence, evidenced by some ancient cities, with the more stable areas and those that behave differently showing that even in historic and protohistoric Sardinia, while considered a stable land, suffer a continuous weak lifting or subsidence comforted by archaeological data showing that, at the same time, the progression of the phenomenon is different.

These Autonomous Systems are already being deployed in industrial sectors but in controlled scenarios (e.g. static automated production lines, fixed sensors). They start to get into difficulties when the task increases in complexity or the environment is uncontrolled (e.g. drones for offshore windfarm inspection), or where there is a high interaction with people and entities in the world (e.g. self-driving cars) or where they have to work as a team (e.g. cobots working in a factory). The EN-TRUST Vision is that these systems learn situations where trust is typically lost unnecessarily, adapting this prediction for specific people and contexts. Stakeholder trust will be managed through transparent interaction, increasing the confidence of the stakeholders to use the Autonomous Systems, meaning that they can be adopted in scenarios never before thought possible, such as doing the jobs that endanger humans (e.g. first responders or pandemic related tasks). The EN-TRUST 'Trust' Node will perform foundational research on how humans and Autonomous Systems (AS) can work together by building a shared reality, based on mutual understanding through trustworthy interaction. The EN-TRUST Node will create a UK research centre of excellence for trust that will inform the design of Autonomous Systems going forward, ensuring that they are widely used and accepted in a variety of applications. This cross-cutting multidisciplinary approach is grounded in Psychology and Cognitive Science and consists of three pillars of trust: 1) computational models of human trust in AS; 2) adaptation of these models in the face of errors and uncontrolled environments; and 3) user validation and evaluation across a broad range of sectors in realistic scenarios. This EN-TRUST framework will explore how to best establish, maintain and repair trust by incorporating the subjective view of human trust towards Autonomous Systems, thus maximising their positive societal and economic benefits.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/V026682/1,,,,,,,,Heriot-Watt University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15385502,,

These moorings measure (hourly, year-round) water velocity, water temperature and salinity, and the thickness and motion of the seasonal sea ice in the region. The installations are available also to support instrumentation from other studies, e.g., marine mammal research. The project will provide data products of oceanic fluxes and water properties at various timescales (including hourly, monthly, and annual), interacting with stakeholders to provide the most relevant products. Combining these data with satellite data sets, modeling results, and indigenous knowledge, the researchers will quantify long-term change and the changing drivers of the properties of the inflow. The project also trains students in oceanographic techniques; brings western science to the classroom through a ?5-year journey in science? outreach project to native communities in Alaska and Hispanic/Latino-dominated schools in Seattle; and connects the Arctic and the public through university classes, various public talks, and the annual Polar Science Weekend at Seattle?s major Science museum. Part B: The Pacific inflow to the Arctic Ocean (which is via the Bering Strait) is critical to the oceanic systems of the Alaskan seas and western Arctic Ocean. Recent years are showing dramatic increase and early warming in this inflow. This has consequences regionally, in the Arctic, and (models suggest) also globally. Consider some examples. The inflow impacts nutrient supply to the nationally crucial Bering Sea, source of ~ 50% of the US fish catch. Heat carried by the inflow (increasing in recent years) is a trigger of early Arctic sea-ice retreat. Water properties of the inflow control how the ocean interacts with sea ice over roughly half the Arctic Ocean. Nutrients carried by the inflow feed Arctic ecosystems, both in the Arctic Ocean and in the US and Canadian northern coastal regions. It is thus vital to assess the changing Pacific inflow to the Arctic - for local native communities; for the new focus on pan-Arctic access, global shipping and resource exploitation; and for understanding (and predicting) how the Arctic is changing and the impacts of that change. To date, the only effective way of making this assessment is through year-round in-water measurements. The US started such measurements in 1990, allowing us now to quantify in context the remarkable transitions currently in progress. This new research will continue these measurements to 2022, also seeking understanding of the drivers of recent change. Crucially, the work will provide oceanic information in useful forms to the many stakeholders, including local and global science, local native communities, the public, and industry (e.g., oil/gas exploration, shipping, tourism). Internationally, the project is a substantial US contribution to global cooperation in the Arctic. Educationally, the project brings science and the Arctic to school and public communities, including role modeling success of diversity in STEM fields.

Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analysis is one of the most common proxies which provide clues for methane rich seep zones. Bacteria and bacterial activity play a vital role in the degradation of organic matter. It has been revealed that the presence of sulphate reducing bacteria at bottom layers of the core, suggests the presence of methane from the subsurface layers where methanogenesis process takes place. The present study is resulted from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), Hole 1325B, during the Pleistocene sequence of North-Eastern Pacific Ocean and further supporting results for entire 311 transect obtained from published records of Shipboard Scientific Party. The total carbon (TC), inorganic carbon (IC) and TOC content is examined individually for 357 samples from various depths, measures the rate of deposition of total organic carbon. The average values of TC, IC and TOC shows quite fluctuating trends in the study region with 0.67 wt%, 0.11 wt% and 0.56 wt% respectively. Many published results suggest that 0.5 wt% TOC is required for hydrate formation by determining the average TOC content at hydrate bearing sediments. The outcome of proposed study put forward that the TOC content is an important aspect for the formation of methane hydrate in marine sediment. The rate of methane generated, dissolved methane are also estimated in order to calculate the pore space methane hydrate in the study area. This accumulation can roughly explain the average amount of hydrates as 0.85% in the sediments at the study region and 0.88% particularly from Hole 1325B where the amount of methane generated at 146.48 mM.

Finding the connection between the thermodynamic conditions of hydrocarbon mixtures synthesis and zones of oil and gas accumulation. Methodology. The thermodynamic eguilibrium depths of gas and gas condensate deposits were fixed by the method of eguilibrium constants of independent reactions based on the chemical composition of hydrocarbons re-counted on chemical elements. The investigations of formation waters, natural gases and water-dissolved gases were based on the methods of chemical, elementary spectral, atomic absorption and gas chromatographic analysis. Results. Received data point to essential differences in depths of a thermodynamic equilibrium for the deposits of Eocene, Maikopian, and Neogene on the one hand, and Lower Paleocene and Cretaceous sediments on the other. The first ones are characterized by values of depths in boundaries from 30 to 50 km while the second ones show a similar parameters in the boundaries from 120 to150 km. The analysis of the geological, hydrogeological and geochemical circumstances of the Pre-Black Sea aquiferous basin (PBSAB) testified to that the gas-vapour mixtures that are the sources of the Upper Cretaceous, Paleocene and Maikopian gas deposits are formed in high-temperature zone (about 300 degrees C) of depth origin. We consider the Lower Paleocene fields as primary formed only if gases rapidly migrated vertically (in free phase) from high-temperature places of their generation. The ways of possible migration were sublatitudinal faults and zones of decompression. The hydrocarbon fields in Maikopian and even Miocene sediments show the further way of vertical migration of gas and its accumulation in the traps throughout the whole way. Based on the analysis of the hydrogeological, hydro-and gas-geochemical investigations and thermodynamic calculations the model of gas fields forming in PBSAB was carried out. Originality. Hydrogeological data and thermodynamic calculations indicate the depth of origin of hydrocarbons. We suppose that differences in equilibrium depths between the fields of various deposits are coherent with peculiarities of processes of their filling with fluids. The maximum localization of gas-condensate fields at depths of 1900-3000 m testifies not to hydrocarbons formation in this range of depths, but to optimum geology-hydrogeological conditions of forming and of preservation deposits. The migration and preservation of hydrocarbons demand essentially various geology-physical and hydrogeological circumstances: the first is favoured by dynamics of the hydrostatic pressure systems, active tectogenesis, high temperatures, low mineralization of waters; guasistagnat environment, moderate temperatures, presence of the reservoirs that overlapped by reliable seals are favourable for the other. The zone of oil and gas accumulation is related to elisional systems; and zone of through migration to thermohydrodynamic water drive systems. Practical significance. The received data allow forecasting composition of a hydrocarbonaceous component of a field proceeding from its proximity to a decompressions zone and depth of occurrence. We guess that with depth the amount of heavy alkanes will be incremented. The gas condensate fields, on depths more than 1900 m, have a plutonic genesisis.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1992-142X,2519-2663,,,,,,,,,,"NAS Ukraine, Inst Geol & Geochem Combustible Minerals, Kiev, Ukraine",,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000442290500002,,

The current regulations known as the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations were promulgated in 1992. This followed several highly publicized catastrophic incidents (e.g., Phillips 66 Pasadena, Texas polyethylene plant explosion, 1989; Piper Alpha, North Sea, 1988 and Bhopal, India, 1984). The US approach to regulation is best described as a combination of prescriptive and performance-based regulations that address safety-considerations in design and operations. A safety case approach, as used in the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and Norway, requires a detailed analysis of hazards and steps taken to address those hazards, and thus minimize or mitigate the risk. Both the safety case and PSM processes address many of the same aspects such as management of change, identification of hazards and assessment of risks, but the process and format for documentation and regulatory review differs.The question then arises as to the effectiveness of these two regulatory regimes in preventing process safety related incidents. Many reputable organizations and research groups have taken positions regarding whether the US should abandon the existing system of safety regulations. Review of several global incidents has shown that while appropriate hazards and risks were identified, operational shortcomings led to incidents.Uniform and consistent process safety data are in the early stages of being collected and published by such organizations as the American Petroleum Institute (API) and The International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (OGP), using API RP 754 defined metrics. For this paper, data have been collected on oil and gas operations in the US, UK, Norway and Australia to compare the performance of the differing regulatory regimes. While the data are not comprehensive, from existing data on major incidents, spills and fatalities, one cannot conclude that one regulatory regime is superior to the other. Consistent reporting of incidents in a database with appropriate metrics is sorely needed.Furthermore, the authors express the need to move beyond regulatory compliance and suggest research on application of a systems approach to process safety by developing a process resilience analysis framework for process design and operations.

Prospectivity at shallower levels has been largely ignored due to the fact that the main regional seal in the area was recognized to be the T35/T36 mudstones below the Kettla Tuff. Seismo-stratigraphic analysis of the T38 sequence directly above the tuff marker has identified the potential for a new play type, especially adjacent to fault zones where these mudstones are breached, allowing hydrocarbons to migrate from the Upper Jurassic source kitchen into any traps identified above the seal. In this area, the T38 is represented by a series of northerly prograding low-angle clinoforms representing the final marine infill of sediments into the basin from the south. Erosion of top sets in a more marginal setting is observed, along with deposition of basin floor fans at the toe of the prograding clinoforms. The overlying seals are basinal sediments as well as mudstones and siltstones of subsequent progradational sequences. Mild structural modification of potential stratigraphic traps in the Judd Basin occurred during the Oligo-Miocene inversion associated with continued opening of the North Atlantic. Drilling seismic amplitude anomalies in the West of Shetlands area has often been unsuccessful. Therefore, a fully integrated geophysical and geological evaluation was carried out on the T38 anomaly comprising rock physics, amplitude variation with offset analysis, fault seal analysis and the acquisition of a CSEM survey which, supported by a valid geologic model, have reduced the risk from high to moderate. The results indicate that the anomaly has the potential to be sand-bearing and contain oil and gas.

However, the fundamental behavior of hydrate dissociation during energy recovery is not fully understood due to the complex interplay of phase change and multiphase flow within porous media. In this study, the effect of horizontal wellbore incorporation on the simultaneous gas and water production during the dissociation of methane hydrates in sandy sediment (0.1-0.5 mm) was investigated. A horizontal perforated wellbore was incorporated within water saturated hydrate bearing sediments of 40% hydrate, 55% aqueous and 5% gaseous phase saturation to mimic marine hydrate sediments, and the gas and water production behavior from horizontal wellbore (HW) was compared with the base case (without well) at 3 bottom hole pressures (BHPs) of 3.5, 4.0, and 4.5 MPa under a constant surrounding temperature of 281.5 K. The evolution of temperature across 12 measured locations within the 1 L sediment demonstrated the significant effect of horizontal wellbore incorporation on heat transfer within sediment. Through the incorporation of horizontal wellbore, a continuous production of gas was observed for an extended period of time as compared to the base cases without a well. The resulting cumulative gas production was enhanced by 5.5-10% at various BHPs; whereas the cumulative water production was significantly reduced by 30.8-36.9% at different BHPs from the base cases. By estimating the percentage of hydrate dissociated, it was found that the incorporation of horizontal wellbore in the current apparatus caused a slower hydrate dissociation, as reflected by a longer time to dissociate 50% (t(50,h)) and 90% (t(90,h)) of the hydrates. This study demonstrates the potential of horizontal wellbore incorporation to simultaneously enhance gas production and reduce water production, unveiling a future direction in optimizing gas recovery from hydrate reservoirs through innovative wellbore design, configurations and well placement strategies.",,,,,,,,,75,10,0,0,2,0,80,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Singapore 117585, SingaporeTaiyuan Univ Technol, Min Technol Inst, Taiyuan 030024, Peoples R ChinaLloyds Register Global Technol Ctr Pte Ltd, Singapore 138522, Singapore",Lloyds Register Global Technol Ctr Pte Ltd,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000426411300010,,

Depending on the circumstances these pipelines may be buried for physical protection or for additional thermal insulation using robotic trenching equipment. This results in a complex cut and backfill geometry in the seafloor in addition to altering the thermal properties of the backfill. A two-dimensional boundary element model was developed specifically to address to investigate the local steady-state thermal field in the near field of the pipeline. The model allows one to account for the complex geometries in the near field associated with this burial technique, site-specific multi-layered soil conditions and the seawater adjacent to the seafloor. A parametric study was preformed to evaluate effects of the thermal power loss, burial depth, pipe diameter and soil thermal conductivity on the thermal field in the near field of a buried pipeline. The numerical examples illustrate the influence of the backfill thermal property on the temperature at the pipe wall, that the pipe diameter controls the required output thermal power needed to maintain the desired pipe wall temperature, and the importance of pipeline burial depth on seabed temperature distribution above the pipeline.

The Holocene period is characterized by early deposition of gyttja in a pond environment with aquatics such as Nuphar polysepalum and Potamogeton, and a significant regional presence of Alnus crispa subsp. sinuata. Carbon accumulation (50 g/m(2)/a) was high for a short interval in the early Holocene when Sphagnum peat accumulated, but was followed by a major decline to 13 g/m(2)/a from 7 to 3.7 ka when Cyperaceae and ericads such as Rhododendron (formerly Ledum) groenlandicum expanded. This shift to sedge growth is representative of many peatlands throughout the south-central region of Alaska, and indicates a drier, more evaporative environment with a large decline in carbon storage. The subsequent return to Sphagnum peat after 4 ka in the Neoglacial represents a widespread shift to moister, cooler conditions, which favored a resurgence of ericads, such as Andromeda polifolia, and increased carbon accumulation rate. The sustained Alnus expansion visible in the top 10 cm of the peat profile is correlative with glacial retreat and warming of the region in the last century, and suggests this colonization will continue as temperature increases and ice melts.

Air pollution caused by the exhaust emissions of coastal ships has a detrimental environmental effect upon the coastal human population and the natural resources. The high coastal shipping activity within the Greek seas and the environmental vulnerability of the Greek coasts present a case that undoubtedly deserves particular attention. To this extent, the utilization of liquified natural gas (LNG) for powering island ferries constitutes a promising alternative to oil-fuel for achieving a sizable reduction of SOX, NOX, and porous medium (PM) exhaust pollution. Furthermore, in their effort to improve the quality of the shipping services, island communities often appear to be constantly pushing for new vessels, and LNG engines constitute a suitable opportunity for fleet renewal through the introduction of green shipboard technology.In this paper, the connection of the Greek Dodecanese Islands and the main port of Piraeus with an oil- vs. LNG-fueled ferry line is analyzed. The results indicate that, compared to conventional oil-fuel, natural gas currently offers a favorable alternative in terms of private costs (technical and fuel costs), as well as in terms of the external (damage) costs due to ship exhaust pollution. It is also shown that the LNG shipboard technology has the prospect of extending its advantage with respect to private costs, due to the increasing pressure on oil-fuel-related environmental control and the expansion of the natural gas market.

Based onIndustry statistics, global Oil and Gas companies routinely incur downtime costsestimated as GBP 812,000,000 caused by failed wellbore enlargement (underreaming).Underreaming is essential to maximise production. This is especially true in high-costdeepwater or ultra-deepwater wells which typically require 6 enlarged sections beforecompletion and exceed depths of 27,000 feet. In this way, underreamed hole size is integralto well construction. Yet, it is inherently uncertain and costly in terms of unnaceptabledowntime.If the Smart Reamer were proven downhole, a lucrative opportunity exists. The SmartReamer potentially offers oil companies the ability to reduce downtime and reduceunderreaming risk by measuring wellbore diameter in real-time – a service that is unavailabletoday.Callipers, if used, are traditionally operated as separate measurement services and do notprovide real-time data. A typical Schlumberger statistic shows that 1 in 5 underreaming jobsare likely to experience tool failure than non-underreaming. The Smart Reamer offers a novelstep-change in drilling by integrating the two separate and consecutive services and offeringsimultaneous real-time wellbore condition monitoring.Feedback from oil companies shows an average downtime saving of 24-48 hours rig-time(GBP 500,000 per offshore job). If this can be achieved, this amounts to a potential saving ofover GBP 812,000,000 applied across all current drilling underreaming operations worldwide.The proposed new Smart Reamer Drilling System, if it were proven as a prototype, wouldaccurately measure and provide a real-time view of the well bore allowing the drilling team to:-Pinpoint narrow wellbore sections caused by underreamer wear or changes in geologicalstrata-Eliminate downtime related to deployment of casing in a narrow wellbore. A single failure ofthis nature can cost GBP 3,000,000.-Avoid costly retrieval of equipment, loss of equipment and in the worst case a re-drill orsidetrack-Accurately predict cement volumes to ensure sealing of casing-Eliminate calliper deployment - minimum average saving of GBP 500,000/deepwater welland GBP 62,500/onshore well.Currently, underreaming and measurement are available as disparate and time consumingcomponents. Existing acoustic measurement technology is flawed insofar as downholechanges cause erroneous readings. Our prototype will overcome these flaws by building onthe research and exploiting the patents to provide accurate measurements that allow forvariations in downhole drilling conditions.The Smart Reamer is rapidly scalable, sustainable and has high growth and profitabilitypotential.

In the presence of dispersant, reduction in d50 due to bubbles was small because of the promoted small sizes of both bubbles and droplets by surfactants.

When it is obtained in ways that fail to minimize environmental and political costs, these too can threaten human wellbeing in fundamental and pervasive ways. The energy problem today combines these syndromes: much of the world's population has too little energy to meet basic human needs; the monetary costs of energy are rising nearly everywhere; the environmental impacts of energy supply are growing and already dominant contributors to local, regional, and global environmental problems (including air pollution, water pollution, ocean pollution, and climate change); and the sociopolitical risks of energy supply (above all the danger of conflict over oil and the links between nuclear energy and nuclear weapons) are growing too. This predicament has many causes, but predominant among them are the nearly 20-fold increase in world energy use since 1850 and the cumulative depletion of the most convenient oil and gas deposits that this growth has entailed, resulting in increasing resort to costlier and/or environmentally more disruptive energy sources. The growth of world population in this period was responsible for 52% of the energy growth, while growth in per capita energy use was responsible for 48% (excluding casual connections between population and energy use per capita). In the United States in the same period, population growth accounted for 66% of the 36-fold increase in energy use. In the late 1980s, population growth was still accounting for a third of energy growth both in the United States and worldwide. Coping with global energy problems will require greatly increased investment in improving the efficiency of energy enduse and in reducing the environmental impacts of contemporary energy technologies, and it will require financing a transition over the next several decades to a set of more sustainable (but probably also more expensive) energy sources. The difficulty of implementing these measures will be greatest by far in the developing countries, not least because of their high rates of population growth and the attendant extra pressures on economic and managerial resources. If efficiency improvements permit delivering the high standard of living to which the world aspires based on a per capita rate of energy use as low as 3 kilowatts-about a quarter of the current U.S. figure-then a world population stabilized at 10 billion people would be using energy at a rate of 30 terawatts, and a population of 14 billion would imply 42 terawatts (compare 13.2 terawatts in 1990). Delivering even the lower figure at tolerable monetary and environmental costs will be difficult; each additional billion people added to the world population will compound these difficulties and increase energy's costs, making everyone poorer.",,,,,"SYMP ON POPULATION AND SCARCITY : THE FORGOTTEN DIMENSIONS, IN HONOR OF DR GARETT HARDINSYMP ON POPULATION AND SCARCITY : THE FORGOTTEN DIMENSIONS, IN HONOR OF DR GARETT HARDIN","APR 20, 1990APR 20, 1990",AMER INST BIOL SCI; SMITHSONIAN INSTAMER INST BIOL SCI; SMITHSONIAN INST,"MUSEUM NAT HIST, WASHINGTON, DCMUSEUM NAT HIST, WASHINGTON, DC",123,4,2,0,13,1,143,,,0199-0039,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1991-03-01,WOS:A1991EY90100006,,

The effects of tidal energy extraction on water quality were examined for two energy extraction scenarios as compared with the baseline condition. It was found, in general, that the environmental impacts associated with energy extraction depend highly on the amount of power extracted from the system. Model results indicate that, as a result of energy extraction from the channel, the competition between decreased flushing rates in the bay and increased vertical mixing in the channel directly affects water quality responses in the bay. The decreased flushing rates tend to cause a stronger but negative impact on water quality. On the other hand, the increased vertical mixing could lead to higher bottom dissolved oxygen at times. As the first modeling effort directly aimed at examining the impacts of tidal energy extraction on estuarine water quality, this study demonstrates that numerical models can serve as a very useful tool for this purpose.

Such interest is connected with the beginning of development of hydrocarbonic fields of the Arctic, questions of geopolitical influence, placement and expansion of military bases and the military contingent. Increase in kinds of activity in the region involves need of involvement of the qualified specialists capable to transfer working conditions in the north. Today, the need for HR for the Arctic only for development of oil and gas fields of the Barents Sea makes 15-20 thousand people by different estimates. However, despite great demand on a manpower, on all subjects of the region continuous outflow of the population is observed. It is confirmed by data of territorial authorities of service of the state statistics. For example, outflow of the population in Murmansk region in 2000 - 16,5%, in 2015 - 5, 7%. And, about 90% are made by migration within Russia, that is the population chooses more comfortable conditions for life and development. Need of creation of mechanisms of attraction of human resources to the Arctic was sounded by the top officials of the government during the International Arctic forum The Arctic - the Territory of Dialogue on March 29-30, 2017 (a speech of the Russian President V.

Scientific novelty of the project consists in development of the social and economic mechanism of attraction of human resources to the Arctic. Unlike the existing methods, the developed social and economic mechanism will lean on complex researches in the field of psychology, sociology and economy.

These areas are likely to increase in number and size as sea ice melts and abundant Arctic natural resources become more accessible. Documenting the changes that have already occurred is essential to inform management approaches to minimize the impacts of future activities. Here, we determine the cumulative geoecological effects of 62years (1949-2011) of infrastructure- and climate-related changes in the Prudhoe Bay Oilfield, the oldest and most extensive industrial complex in the Arctic, and an area with extensive ice-rich permafrost that is extraordinarily sensitive to climate change. We demonstrate that thermokarst has recently affected broad areas of the entire region, and that a sudden increase in the area affected began shortly after 1990 corresponding to a rapid rise in regional summer air temperatures and related permafrost temperatures. We also present a conceptual model that describes how infrastructure-related factors, including road dust and roadside flooding are contributing to more extensive thermokarst in areas adjacent to roads and gravel pads. We mapped the historical infrastructure changes for the Alaska North Slope oilfields for 10 dates from the initial oil discovery in 1968-2011. By 2010, over 34% of the intensively mapped area was affected by oil development. In addition, between 1990 and 2001, coincident with strong atmospheric warming during the 1990s, 19% of the remaining natural landscapes (excluding areas covered by infrastructure, lakes and river floodplains) exhibited expansion of thermokarst features resulting in more abundant small ponds, greater microrelief, more active lakeshore erosion and increased landscape and habitat heterogeneity.

Microscopic examination shows that there are four major destructive diageneses such as dissolution, dedolomitization, pressure solution, and tectonic rupture, and six types of constructive diaenesis namely micritization, compaction, cementation, dolomitization, silicification, and recrystallization developed in the studying area. Combined with the C-O isotope analysis results, this area has three main diagenetic environments such as marine (shallow marine platform and deep sea slope), meteoric (vadose and phreatic zone), and burial, which response to different diagenesese. Micritization (shallow marine platform) and the first type of silicification (deep sea slope) occurs in marine environment; burial environment contains mainly compaction, pressure solution, dolomitization, the third type of selective silification and late recrystallization; meteoric environment develops cementation (including drusy isopachous rim cement, drusy cement and coaxial accretion cement, belonging to phreatic zone, gravity-type cement and crescent cement, belonging to vadose zone), dissolution, early recrystallization, dedolomitization and the second type of silicification. Along with rich organic matters, the studying area has high porosity, up to 2% similar to 5%, and mainly developed in the pressure solution of Chuanshan and Qixia Formations, and in the silicon members and silicon highly contained limestone of Qixia Formation.

The relationship between momentum flux and wind speed showed a clear dependence on the degree of sea ice cover, a result facilitated by the geographical coverage possible with a ship-based approach.

These valves have been selected for analysis because they are the largest, heaviest, and most important valves on topside platforms in the offshore sector of the oil and gas industry. FMEA is a systematic approach for evaluation and identification of potential failures associated with the design and operation of pipeline valves. A literature review is included to provide more detailed information about the operation, components, and failure modes of pipeline ball valves. Five failure possibilities associated with pipeline ball valves have been identified, including leakage from the body and seat of a valve during operation; lack of a proper factory acceptance test; valve body damage due to pipeline loads because of insufficient thickness; missing the finite element analysis on the body of the valves; and seat damages as a result of wax ingress. The severity and possibility of occurrence have been defined and assigned to each possible failure. A risk priority number has been calculated for each failure mode on a scale of 1-100. Two risk items have been recognized as critical, with score values between 50 and 60. The outcome of FMEA shows that seats of pipeline valves are the most exposed components at risk of failure. The most critical identified failure related to the seats is accumulation of wax in the seat area. The proposed solution is to apply flushing ports and double-isolate them with modular valves to minimize the risk of leakage to the environment. The second critical failure is related to damage of the valve body due to pipeline loads. Valve wall thickness calculations according to ASME Sec. VII Div. 02, as well as stress analysis on the valve body based on different loads, are proposed to minimize the risk of the second failure.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,1547-7029,1864-1245,,,,,,,,,,"Baker Hughes, Manifold Engn, Oslo, Norway",Baker Hughes,,,2020-08-07,WOS:000552239600002,,

Generally speaking, a remotely operated underwater vehicle allows to investigate areas inaccessible or too dangerous for human beings. The use of remotely operated underwater vehicles during a mission, with the related implication of support ships and specialized pilots, or the involvement of professional divers, is usually associated with high costs. The reduction of these costs is an important topic in the underwater robotic field and the easy piloting of these mobile robots is a crucial aspect in their development. This article describes Nemo remotely operated underwater vehicle, a remotely operated underwater vehicle prototype specifically designed for the exploration of the Costa Concordia wreck, Isola del Giglio, Italy. Nemo remotely operated underwater vehicle can be considered a mini-remotely operated underwater vehicle, that is, a remotely operated underwater vehicle with weight less than 25kg and easily deployable from a small boat. This article describes the main characteristics of the vehicle: the onboard control logic and on the development of a user-friendly graphical user interface for underwater navigation able to take advantage of its high maneuverability.

We compared leaf traits relating to resource investment, carbon return, and resource-use efficiency in 16 native (endemic) and three non-native (invasive) species in a temperate forest in Canterbury, South Island, New Zealand. Trait differences were more closely associated with leaf habit than nativity. Deciduous species (including invaders) exhibited greater maximum photosynthetic rates at similar resource costs, which resulted in greater nitrogen-and energy-use efficiencies than evergreen natives. Leaf area was the only trait that differed significantly by nativity (over two-fold larger in invaders). Invaders and deciduous natives both occupied the 'fast return' end of the leaf economics spectrum in contrast to the native evergreens which had comparatively slow return on investment. Dominant woody invaders in this forest are physiologically distinct from many New Zealand endemic species, which are overwhelmingly evergreen.

The selection of the optimal sequence of measures is a sophisticated procedure and a multicriteria decision making process was established regarding this study, both for mitigation and adaptation measures. Mitigation options aim to minimise CO2 emissions and greenhouse gas emissions in general, in order to decrease their concentration levels, as well as to drop the increase rate of global temperature, i.e. actions contributing to the mitigation of the greenhouse gas emissions, or the increase of their storage tanks. Indicatively, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology and Biogas utilisation methods are among the mitigation measures under study. On the other hand, adaptation measures are defined as the ability of the natural or human systems to handle the impact of the climate change and to adjust to its effects, aiming to eliminate the consequences and take advantage of any beneficial outcomes. Adaptation measures are also considered in this study, such as the Embankments in coastal areas and the Switch to biological cultivations and application of a complete culture management method.A questionnaire was designed for the above purposes, in order to provide qualitative information necessary to compare mitigation and adaptation options in an overall framework assessment, based on specific decision criteria. Climate change experts and scientists gave their feedback via a face-to-face interview. The basic tool for the assessment during the present study was the ELECTRE III multicriteria analysis methodology. ELECTRE III fits best to complex environmental problems such as confronting/adapting to climate change and relative decision making. A comparative assessment and an optimal sequence of mitigation and adaptation measures, in order to confront climate change is provided.

Ocean acidity (H+ concentration) and bicarbonate ion concentrations are increasing, whereas carbonate ion concentrations are decreasing. There has already been an average pH decrease of 0.1 in the upper ocean, and continued unconstrained carbon emissions would further reduce average upper ocean pH by approximately 0.3 by 2100. Laboratory experiments, observations and projections indicate that such ocean acidification may have ecological and biogeochemical impacts that last for many thousands of years. The future magnitude of such effects will be very closely linked to atmospheric CO2; they will, therefore, depend on the success of emission reduction, and could also be constrained by geoengineering based on most carbon dioxide removal (CDR) techniques. However, some ocean-based CDR approaches would (if deployed on a climatically significant scale) re-locate acidification from the upper ocean to the seafloor or elsewhere in the ocean interior.

While reduction of fossil fuels will be an essential step for reducing atmospheric CO2, Negative Emission Technologies (NETs) can help meet emission targets. During combustion, CO2 can be extracted, transported, and stored in geologic repositories - this is the process of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Combining bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) could result in negative emissions of CO2. BECCS is attractive since it results in a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere while also providing a renewable source of energy. However, BECCS requires a large commitment of land and will have impacts on food and water availability. This work focuses on BECCS and addresses the challenges for planning a global and nationwide distribution of bioenergy crops.The vast majority of IPCC scenarios that remain below 2 degrees C makes use of NET in the 21st century. Although bioenergy crops and BECCS are an essential component of the scenarios (produced by Integrated Assessment Models, or IAMs), the crops in even the most sophisticated IAMs only respond to mean changes in climate. This results in an inconsistency in the modelling framework: the IAMs can assume bioenergy crops are effective at drawing down CO2 and producing energy in a region where actually climate change will reduce their effectiveness. Earth System Models (ESMs) represent the dynamics of the atmosphere, oceans, sea ice, and land surface. They can account for biophysical (i.e. changes to albedo and latent heat fluxes) and biogeochemical (i.e. uptake or release of greenhouse gases) feedbacks due to land use change. They are the only tool available to investigate future impacts of spatial and temporal variability in climate on the food, energy, and water nexus. However, the ESMs used in the last IPCC report only accounted for a generic crop type at best, not differentiating between bioenergy and food crops. Without an explicit representation of bioenergy crops in ESMs, the effects of climate change do not feedback to affect the food, energy, and water resources assumed to be true in the IAMs. There is an urgent need for predicting the productivity of bioenergy crops in a coupled climate simulation, to see the impact of a range of climate change on the productivity, and associated impacts on food crop productivity, energy production, and water availability. In this project, I will include representations of first and second generation bioenergy crops in the UK ESM, and investigate the impacts of climate change on the productivity at the global and regional (for the UK) level. This work will assess the viability of negative emissions of CO2 through bioenergy crops as an effective climate mitigation strategy under a changing climate, and provide data to support decisions that will minimize the impacts of both climate change and climate change mitigation on bioenergy production, food, and water availability. The outcomes of this project will enhance the resilience of the food/water/energy nexus to climate change and climate variability through better planning, and providing socially responsible recommendations for balancing the challenges of reducing climate change with feeding our growing global population.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/N030141/1,,,,,,,,University of Exeter,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15378431,,

Typically, though, the surface is irregular, due to sedimentological and stratigraphic effects or structural deformation. In this study, the area where the CO2 migrates beneath the caprock is investigated. A set of numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the impacts of various factors on CO2 storage, such as top morphology, tilt, k(v)/k(h) ratio and the presence of a transition zone, where there is a gradational change from storage formation to caprock.In the models tested, the k(v)/k(h) ratio was most important during the injection period, but after injection ceased, the tilt was more important. The amplitude of the ridges, which were used to represent the top morphology, did not have a large effect but, as expected hindered or encouraged migration depending on whether they were perpendicular or parallel to the tilt. A transition zone can increase the security of storage by lessening the amount of CO2 accumulating underneath the caprock. Therefore it is important to characterise the interface in terms of the size of irregularities and also in terms of the existence of any transition zone. The latter has not been addressed in previous works. A simple formula was derived to predict the limiting tilt for trapping to occur in models with a sinusoidal interface with wavelength, lambda, and amplitude, A. Although this is a simplified approach, it provides a means of assessing whether the topography of the top surface will give rise to significant trapping or not.

These data provide estimates of strong ocean currents, which may affect extreme loads, structural failure, and daffy operations on the oil platforms and drilling rigs. Real-time data from near the surface to 1000 meters are reported every 20 minutes to the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and displayed on their public website. The oil and gas companies must also measure near-bottom currents at sites deeper than 1100 meters and recover and report these data at least every six months. These delayed-mode data are the subject of this effort.NDBC began accepting real-time current profile data in April 2005 and implemented real-time quality control of the data in March 2006 [1]. In August 2006, NDBC received four files containing the near-bottom, delayed-mode data. The data were processed through the same quality control algorithms and stored along with previously processed near-surface data. Since that time eighty-four additional data sets have been received and processed through the quality control algorithms at NDBC. Tables of these data with quality control flags and current velocity plots with depth are available to the general public on the NDBC website.One of the first delayed-mode data sets was collected from the Na Kika platform, approximately 100 kilometers south-east of the Mississippi River delta, during the active Hurricane season of 2005. The data from August 2005 showed greater than 0.30 cm/s currents at depths greater than 1900 meters to the right of the path of Hurricane Katrina. The currents rotated clockwise in the bottom waters at a period less than 24 hours and decayed over a period of nearly ten days. Although Hurricane Rita passed 360 kilometers to the southwest of the Na Kika platform in late September 2005, the bottom waters were impacted by the passage. The currents were not as strong as those related to Hurricane Katrina, but they were noticeable and lasted for several days. There are no near-surface data sets to corroborate these data because the platforms were evacuated due to the hurricanes.

Malaysia has traditionally been perceived to be safe from the hazards of earthquakes and tsunamis. Local design practices tend to neglect tsunami waves and include no such provisions. In 2004, a 9.3Mw seaquake occurred off the northwest coast of Aceh, which generated tsunami waves that caused destruction in Malaysia totalling US$ 25 million and 68 deaths. This event prompted an awareness of the need to study the reliability of fixed offshore platforms scattered throughout Malaysian waters.

Some other activities like oil and gas exploration and drilling at Barents Sea require also regular sea traffic connections to be opened. Sea operations at arctic zone are challenging, because thick ice generates a high magnitude dynamic load against the hull and the propulsion units. Turning and backward sailing in thick ice field are the most critical operations, in which the steerable propulsion units are in totally different service as in the regular open sea cruising. In such operations the ice field, when guided downwards along the slope of the hull, is broken to large plates, which then are fed against the propulsion unit. The steering propulsion unit itself is a vertically mounted inverse mast column, at the top of which the horizontally spinning propeller(s) can be vertically turned to follow the steering commands Such cantilever structure is now under random collision process when the column is breaking the underwater ice plates to smaller blocks. For hydrodynamic reasons the column has a limited cross-sectional area as compared to the propeller area making it sensitive to bending vibrations. Another dynamic interaction with ice is coming from the periodical blade-ice contact when the ice blocks pushed down to the propulsion depth are completely milled by the units. These two parallel dynamic processes have been the reason for several serious damages and losses of propulsion units leading to expensive service operations by means of support vessels. The purpose of this study has been to model the underwater propulsion system with all essential structures, parts and interactions with the surrounding fluid field and floating ice blocks. This brings a complex analysis, in which random collisions and periodical machining forces are loading the elastic hull-mounted inverse mast column with high end mass. The response behavior led to predictions for the reasons of the observed damages especially in case of collapsed bolt connections in the units.",,,,,12th ASME Biennial Conference on Engineering Systems Design and Analysis (ESDA2014)12th ASME Biennial Conference on Engineering Systems Design and Analysis (ESDA2014),"JUN 25-27, 2014JUN 25-27, 2014",ASMEASME,"Copenhagen, DENMARKCopenhagen, DENMARK",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4584-4,,,,,,,,,"Tampere Univ Technol, Dept Intelligent Hydraul & Automat, FIN-33101 Tampere, FinlandECE Paris, Grad Sch Engn, F-75015 Paris, France",ECE Paris,,,2015-10-07,WOS:000361405700021,,

To investigate the role of microorganisms on Erika oil degradation, microbial mats from the Guerande salt marches were maintained in slurries containing the pollutant. From these slurries experiments, a low biodegradation rate of the Erika oil was detected indicating the degradation capacities of microbial mats. Biodiversity studies were conducted to further understand the biodegradation processes.

The Cretaceous Period offers special opportunities to understand global processes and their variations. It was a time of pronounced eustatic change and oceanic anoxia. Its sediments record Milankovitch rhythms and the development and demise of carbonate platforms. It is a turning point in the evolution of life, and its deposits include vast amounts of natural resources including oil and gas, coal, phosphorite, bauxite, kaolinite and manganese ores. To implement this pilot project, a series of five workshops is planned in Europe for 1988, each corresponding to one of the working groups within the CRER project: (1) sequence stratigraphy and sea level change, (2) sedimentation in oxygen-deficient oceans, (3) cyclo- stratigraphy, (4) development and demise of carbonate platforms, and (5) paleogeography, paleoclimatology, and sediment flux. Following these workshops, a general workshop will take place near Digne, France, to provide overall coordination for this project. An Interim U.S. Program Committee for the Global Sedimentary Geology Program (GSGP) has been established by the Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists (SEPM), under whose auspices GSGP was initially developed. This committee has the responsibility of ensuring adequate participation of U.S. scientists in Project CRER.

The seedlings were grown in greenhouses for ambient CO2 (400 ppm) and in enclosed CO2-controlled chambers, which were installed inside the greenhouses for elevated CO2 (800 ppm). The tidal flooding duration was set-up according to the species distribution in the intertidal zone in New Caledonia for the controlled treatment and was increased by 1 h 45min for the experimental treatment. A total of 400 A. marina and 720 R. stylosa were monitored during this experiment. We measured heights and basal diameters of all seedlings every 90 days, and we determined the above and below ground biomass at the end of the experiment. Our results showed that elevated CO2 increased the growth rates of both A. marina and R. stylosa, for which the final biomass was, respectively, 46 and 32% higher than in the ambient CO2 treatment. We suggest that this increase was driven by a stimulation of photosynthesis under elevated CO2, as demonstrated in a previous study. Considering the tidal flooding duration treatment, we observed a contrasted effect between the species. Longer tidal flooding increased the growth of A. marina, whereas it reduced the growth of R. stylosa in comparison to the controlled treatment. This result may be related to the specific ecosystem zonation in this semi-arid climate, which limits water inputs into the Avicennia zone that increases the salt concentration in the soil, whereas Rhizophora is regularly submerged by tides due to its lower position in the intertidal zone. As a result, the combination of both treatments had a positive cumulative effect on the growth of A. marina. Although it was not the case for R. stylosa, the negative effect of longer tidal flooding on this species did not suppress the enhancement of growth resulting from elevated CO2 concentrations. At the end of the experiment, elevated CO2 increased the C:Nratios of the seedlings, thereby producing a more refractory organic matter, which will potentially result in lower decomposition rates and thus may increase carbon accumulation in mangrove soils. These results suggest that future climate changes may enhance the productivity of mangrove seedlings by increasing their growth, which may in turn increase the carbon storage potential of mangroves in their biomass.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,0,7,,,2296-701X,,,,,,,,,,,"UPMC, CNRS, Inst Rech Dev, IMPMC,MNHN, Noumea, New CaledoniaUniv Nouvelle Caledonie, ISEA, EA 7484, BPR4, Noumea, New CaledoniaUniv Orleans, CNRS, ISTO, BRGM,UMR 7327, Orleans, France",,,,2019-05-17,WOS:000467430000001,,

Notable examples being complex topology, multi-state behaviour, component interdependencies, and interactions with external phenomena. For such systems, analytical techniques have limited applicability, and efficient simulation techniques are, therefore, required. In this paper, a novel load-flow simulation approach is proposed to simplify the availability assessment of realistic engineering systems. The approach is simple and generally applicable to systems, including those with limited maintenance teams, reconfiguration requirements, and multiple commodity flows. A novel metric for assessing maintenance inadequacy and a real-time component ranking procedure are also introduced. In real-time ranking, failed components are assigned maintenance priorities during simulation in accordance with how much their availability improves system performance and how many idle maintenance teams there are. This eliminates the need for component importance ranking algorithms prior to simulation, which for some systems may be unnecessary. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated by analysing an offshore plant producing oil, gas, and water. The solution obtained is compared against another Monte Carlo simulation-based solution that requires the enumeration of the plant's cut-sets. The proposed approach is shown to be more intuitive, robust to human-induced errors, and require less human effort.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,12,,,0951-8320,1879-0836,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Liverpool, Inst Risk & Uncertainty, Chadwick Bldg,Peach St, Liverpool L69 7ZE, Merseyside, EnglandNatl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Nucl Engn & Sci, Hsinchu, Taiwan",,,,2017-07-04,WOS:000403993800037,,

As the region embarks upon an unprecedented phase of economic expansion in the 21st century, it faces several environmental challenges fuelled partly by the pressures caused by human activities such as oil and gas exploration, housing development, and road construction for transportation, economic development and demographic changes. This continued growth has resulted in environmental problems such as coastal wetland loss, habitat degradation, and water pollution, gas flaring, destruction of forest vegetation as well as a host of other issues. This underscores the urgent need to design new approaches for managing remote costal resources in sensitive tropical environments effectively in order to maintain a balance between coastal resource conservation and rapid economic development in developing countries for sustainability. Notwithstanding previous initiatives, there have not been any major efforts in the literature to undertake a remote sensing and GIS based assessment of the growing incidence of environmental change within coastal zone environments of the study area. This project is an attempt to fill that void in the literature by exploring the applications of GIS and remote sensing in a tropical coastal zone environment with emphasis on the environmental impacts of development in the Niger Delta region of Southern Nigeria. To deal with some of the aforementioned issues, several research questions that are of great relevance to the paper have been posed. The questions include, Have there been any changes in the coastal environment of the study area? What are the impacts of the changes? What forces are responsible for the changes? Has there been any major framework in place to deal with the changes? The prime objective of the paper is to provide a novel approach for assessing the state of coastal environments while the second objective seeks a contribution to the literature. The third objective is to provide a decision support tool for coastal resource managers in the assessment of environmental impacts of development in tropical areas. The fourth objective is to assess the extent of change in a tropical ecosystem with the latest advances in geo-spatial information technologies and methods. In terms of methodology, the paper draws from primary and census data sources analyzed with descriptive statistics, GIS techniques and remote sensing. The sections in the paper consist of a review of the major environmental effects and factors associated with the problem: initiatives and mitigation measures. The project offers some recommendations as part of the conservation strategies. In spite of concerted efforts by managers to address the problems, results revel that the study area experienced some significant changes in its coastal environments.

The reduction of CO2 emissions can be summarized into two aspects. Firstly, people could use renewable energy to provide energy support for economic and social development. These renewable energies mainly include solar energy; wind energy, hydro, and marine energies; geothermal energy; and biomass energy. The second aspect is the sequestration and conversion of CO2. CO2 is also a form of carbon resource that can be a favorable alternative to traditional carbon resources. The utilization of CO2 can solve both environmental pollution and depletion of traditional carbon resources at the same time.

This has resulted in our fossil fuel resources being vastly reduced and has increased the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere which is causing global warming. The 2020 European Union (EU) targets have been set out to promote the use of renewable technologies and reduce the electricity demand. From the reviewed literature, it was acknowledged that most of these renewable forms of energy sources were initially capital intensive to construct but once constructed they had low operating costs, paying themselves of over their lifecycle. In this study, primary research was undertaken by means of a case study and structured interviews. The case study formed a background to the UK's current and planned offshore wind installations. The results of the interviews were analysed using the NVIVO qualitative software analysis package. This identified themes within the data which allowed them to be analysed and evaluated. The primary data results concluded that the EU targets were challenging but achievable and that the UK government was very supportive in pushing for these targets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The mooring system was designed using finite element analysis to estimate the additional investment. An LNG ship-to-ship bunkering operation that included an LNG bunkering terminal, LNG carrier, LNG bunkering shuttle, and LNG receiving ship was adopted. To estimate the technical feasibility and economic benefit of the proposed mooring system, the availabilities of two types of LNG bunkering terminals were compared considering the acceptance criteria for LNG ship-to-ship transfers. One LNG bunkering terminal was a typical barge-type floater and the other was the pile-guided floater. The relative motion of the terminal with the LNG carrier and the LNG bunkering shuttle was analyzed. The limiting wave height was determined from the maximum relative vertical motion between the floaters at the position of the LNG loading arms.

However, despite high levels of public support for an increase in the use of renewable energy, specific projects have often met with resistance by local residents, a phenomenon often dubbed 'NIMBYism' (Not In My Back Yard) by policy makers, industrialists and media commentators. In this chapter, I argue that the NIMBY concept is an unhelpful way of explaining public responses to technology projects, and an alternative explanation is proposed, drawing from theoretical and empirical literature in Environmental Psychology on the concept of place attachment. From this perspective, local opposition is reconceived as a form of place-protective action, arising when technology projects disrupt pre-existing place attachments and threaten place-related identity processes. This proposal is empirically investigated by means of a case study of a proposed offshore wind farm in North Wales, UK, drawing on both qualitative and quantitative data, collected using in-depth interview and questionnaire methods. Results indicate how the local opposition group employed a discourse of threat to the place in their campaign against the wind farm, arguing that the turbines would 'industrialise' the area and 'fence' in the bay. Analysis of residents' responses indicated that individuals who felt strongly attached to the place were most likely to interpret the project as producing negative local outcomes, to feel negative emotions associated with the project, to indicate low levels of project support and to have undertaken oppositional behaviours such as signing petitions or writing letters to the local paper. Moreover, there was a significant positive correlation between place attachment and trust in the local opposition group, and a significant negative correlation between place attachment and trust in the development company. Conceptually, the results suggest that opposition from the residents was rooted not in so-called 'NIMBYism', but in pre-existing feelings of attachment to the place, which was strategically made use of by the opposition group to mobilise local people against the project using a discourse of threat. More practically, the results suggest the necessity of developers to take processes of place attachment into account when engaging with local residents about their project proposals.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,978-1-60876-356-6,,,,,,,,,"Univ Exeter, Sch Geog, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000276038500017,,

J,,,,,,,,,"Lloyd, Karen",,Collaborative Research: In Situ Oxidation Rates of Methane Injected from Seafloor Gas Seeps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Feb 01 2020,2020,"Thousands of natural gas seeps have been discovered as streams of bubbles rising up from the seafloor just offshore from coastlines around the world. Extensive fields of seeps, largely releasing the same methane gas that we use to heat our homes, have recently been found about a hundred miles east of North Carolina?s Cape Hatteras at water depths as shallow as 300 feet. It is estimated that at least tens of thousands of these hydrocarbon-rich seeps occur on continental margins around the world. The seeps, usually seen as large rising plumes by sonar systems on research ships, inject huge, but poorly quantified, amounts of methane into overlying waters as they rise through the water column. A primary question is how much of the methane, a potent greenhouse gas, actually reaches the atmosphere. This question is the subject of much current research funded by several Federal research agencies including the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. Oceanographers believe that the methane (and other gases included in the bubble streams such as ethane and propane) are either transported away by ocean currents or consumed by microorganisms specially adapted to live with hydrocarbons as their main carbon source. This proposal seeks to determine the importance of microbial consumption in controlling methane distributions in the deep ocean and how the consumption rates depend on concentrations of methane, oxygen and other chemicals, as well as in situ pressures and temperatures. Previous studies in laboratories aboard research ship using samples returned to the surface suggest that microbial consumption of methane from the seeps may lag for a week after its injection into the water column and thus that physical dispersion by currents may dominate deepwater methane dynamics through dilution. However, other measurements suggest that there is no lag before aggressive microbial oxidation of injected methane begins. We have proposed to conduct in situ measurements of microbial methane consumption and related microbial community structure in bottom waters at several coastal and continental margin sites off the North Carolina coast and the northern Gulf of Mexico, where numerous natural seeps have also been observed. We will use new technologies developed after the release of massive quantities of methane during the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf. The sites offer varying concentrations of methane and other chemical and physical conditions such as oxygen concentrations and temperature that will allow us to test specific hypotheses about the role of microbial processes. Through performing the experiments with instruments right on the seafloor next to the seeps we can remove much of the uncertainty surrounding previous shipboard measurements. We will use newly developed seafloor landers equipped with advanced laser methane sensors that are capable of multi-week measurements while assaying dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and the microbial community for the presence of methane-consuming methanotrophs and their activity using advanced genomics techniques that can reveal the nature of methanotrophic responses to ambient methane concentrations. Successful collection of in situ methane consumption rate data and associated microbial community changes should prove important for modeling ocean methane dynamics over a range of oceanographic conditions including seep-enriched bottom waters and bottom waters impacted by accidental hydrocarbon releases. Graduate and undergraduate students supported by the project will gain critical skills in laboratory and field settings and will also benefit from frequent interactions with established researchers from diverse fields. Team members will participate in hands-on undergraduate education and training through developing individualized research projects leading to honors theses, presentations at national meetings and excellent graduate school placements. Graduate and undergraduates will also participate in K-12 science outreach efforts that help to attract and inform the next generation of oceanographers. The team will work with the University of North Carolina Morehead Planetarium and Science Center and participate directly in the North Carolina Science Festival. Through media contacts made from TED talks, exciting results will be broadly disseminated to the public. The project will have immediate relevance for understanding microbially mediated responses to hydrocarbon inputs from accidental releases along the Southeast Atlantic margin where oil and gas exploration are a constant topic of state and national policy discussions. Hundreds of recently discovered gas seeps along the continental margin offshore of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina plus thousands in the northern Gulf of Mexico, inject huge amounts of dissolved methane into overlying shelf and slope waters through dissolution of rising bubble plumes. The fate of the methane is largely controlled by a balance between microbial oxidation and advective transport away from seep sources. The efficacy of microbial oxidation likely depends on concentrations of methane, oxygen and ambient dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), as well as in situ pressures and temperatures. Recent shipboard aerobic methane oxidation rate (AMOR) measurements suggest that microbial consumption of seep methane may lag for a week and thus physical dispersion could dominate deepwater methane dynamics through dilution. However, methane stable carbon isotopic measurements in bottom waters suggest that there is no lag before aggressive oxidation of injected methane begins. We propose to conduct in situ measurements of AMOR while simultaneously investigating its microbial drivers at representative North Carolina and Gulf of Mexico continental margin sites featuring numerous active bubble seeps. These sites offer varying concentrations of methane and DIN; performing the experiments in situ will remove much of the uncertainty of shipboard rates. We will conduct the measurements utilizing newly developed benthic lander systems equipped with advanced laser methane sensors that are capable of multi-week AMOR measurements while assaying dissolved oxygen, DIN and the microbial community for the presence of methanotrophs (through metagenomes) and their activity (through metatranscriptomes) that can reveal the nature of methanotrophic responses to ambient methane concentrations. The project will test key hypotheses about deep-sea methane dynamics including determining if there are significant lags in microbial responses after exposure to elevated methane concentrations, determining the relationships of AMOR to methane and DIN concentrations and investigating the response times and magnitude of methanotrophs to spatial and temporal variability in methane concentration. Successful collection of in situ AMOR and associated microbial community data will prove important for modeling ocean methane dynamics over a range of oceanographic conditions including seep-enriched bottom waters and accidental hydrocarbon releases.

Knowledge of delta vulnerability has raised global concern and stimulated active interdisciplinary research as deltas are densely populated landscapes, rich in agriculture, fisheries, oil and gas, and important means for navigation.There are many ways of looking at this problem which all contribute to a deeper understanding of the functioning of coastal systems. One aspect that has been overlooked thus far, yet fundamental for advancing delta science is connectivity, both physical (how different portions of the system interact with each other) as well as conceptual (pathways of process coupling).In,this paper, I propose a framework called Delta Connectome for studying connectivity in river deltas based on different representations of a delta as a network. After analyzing the classic network representation as a set of nodes (e.g., bifurcations and junctions or regions with distinct physical or statistical behavior) and links (e.g., channels), I show that from connectivity considerations the delta emerges as a leaky network that continuously exchanges fluxes of matter, energy, and information with its surroundings and evolves over time. I explore each network representation and show through several examples how quantifying connectivity can bring to light aspects of deltaic systems so far unexplored and yet fundamental to understanding system functioning and informing coastal management and restoration. This paper serves both as an introduction to the Delta Connectome framework as well as a review of recent applications of the concepts of network and connectivity to deltaic systems within the Connectome framework.

Carbon sources and feeding guilds were assessed from five Barbados seeps and three putative non-seep sites through carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses on numerically-dominant and/or high-biomass species. Thiotmphy and methanotmphy were both observed in Barbados seep symbiotrophs, although no taxa appeared to contain both types of endosymbionts. There was little evidence of incorporation of photosynthetically-derived carbon in the seep food webs except among the deposit feeding ophiuroids and a single sipunculid at the bathyal seep. It is hypothesized that there may be a maximum depth after which chemosynthesis becomes the dominant primary carbon source at seeps. In addition, raphitomid snails and thyasirid clams at two of the three sites that were categorized as non-seep had carbon signatures indicative of thiotrophy. Thus, chemosynthesis may be more widespread within the Barbados accretionary prism seep field than currently thought, potentially through a greater sphere of influence surrounding the seeps or as a result of the 'dark biosphere' of infaunal chemosynthetic organisms.

The oil spills were subsequently observed on different types of satellite images including SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), Chinese HJ-1-B CCD and NASA MODIS. To illustrate the fate of the oil spills, we performed two numerical simulations to simulate the trajectories of the oil spills with the GNOME (General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment) model. For the first time, we drive the GNOME with currents obtained from an operational ocean model (NCOM, Navy Coastal Ocean Model) and surface winds from operational scatterometer measurements (ASCAT, the Advanced Scatterometer). Both data sets are freely and openly available. The initial oil spill location inputs to the model are based on the detected oil spill locations from the SAR images acquired on June 11 and 14. Three oil slicks are tracked simultaneously and our results show good agreement between model simulations and subsequent satellite observations in the semi-enclosed shallow sea. Moreover, GNOME simulation shows that the number of 'splots', which denotes the extent of spilled oil, is a vital factor for GNOME running stability when the number is less than 500. Therefore, oil spill area information obtained from satellite sensors, especially SAR, is an important factor for setting up the initial model conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Plenty of multi-channel seismic data has been obtained in this area, but it is hard to get reflection wave velocity with enough fidelity from the stacking velocity spectrum due to strong multiple interference. Since remarkable information of refraction wave Velocity Could be obtained from the multi-channel seismic data of top interface of the Mesozoic strata, a program package is provided in this paper to pick up refraction seismic velocity from the multi-channel seismic data. In the experiment area, the water depth is 600-800m, and the maximum offset of the survey line is 6 250m. The obtained refraction velocity of the Tertiary is 2. 0-2. 5 km . s(-1), which is similar to the velocity of the Tertiary in the other areas of the Chaoshan Depression. The refraction velocity of the Mesozoic in the southwestern part of the Chaoshan Depression is about 3. 5-4. 5 km . s(-1), generally lower than that of 4. 0-5. 0 km . s(-1) in the middle and eastern parts of the Chaoshan Depression, which may imply that the reservoir property for oil and gas in the southwestern part is better.",,,,,,,,,6,7,0,0,3,0,11,,,1009-5470,,,,,,,,,,,"CAS, S China Sea Inst Oceanol, CAS Key Lab Marginal Sea Geol, Guangzhou 510301, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,,,2009-01-01,BCI:BCI200900295156,,

J,,,,,,,,,"Martens, Christopher",,Collaborative Research: In Situ Oxidation Rates of Methane Injected from Seafloor Gas Seeps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Feb 01 2020,2020,"Thousands of natural gas seeps have been discovered as streams of bubbles rising up from the seafloor just offshore from coastlines around the world. Extensive fields of seeps, largely releasing the same methane gas that we use to heat our homes, have recently been found about a hundred miles east of North Carolina?s Cape Hatteras at water depths as shallow as 300 feet. It is estimated that at least tens of thousands of these hydrocarbon-rich seeps occur on continental margins around the world. The seeps, usually seen as large rising plumes by sonar systems on research ships, inject huge, but poorly quantified, amounts of methane into overlying waters as they rise through the water column. A primary question is how much of the methane, a potent greenhouse gas, actually reaches the atmosphere. This question is the subject of much current research funded by several Federal research agencies including the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. Oceanographers believe that the methane (and other gases included in the bubble streams such as ethane and propane) are either transported away by ocean currents or consumed by microorganisms specially adapted to live with hydrocarbons as their main carbon source. This proposal seeks to determine the importance of microbial consumption in controlling methane distributions in the deep ocean and how the consumption rates depend on concentrations of methane, oxygen and other chemicals, as well as in situ pressures and temperatures. Previous studies in laboratories aboard research ship using samples returned to the surface suggest that microbial consumption of methane from the seeps may lag for a week after its injection into the water column and thus that physical dispersion by currents may dominate deepwater methane dynamics through dilution. However, other measurements suggest that there is no lag before aggressive microbial oxidation of injected methane begins. We have proposed to conduct in situ measurements of microbial methane consumption and related microbial community structure in bottom waters at several coastal and continental margin sites off the North Carolina coast and the northern Gulf of Mexico, where numerous natural seeps have also been observed. We will use new technologies developed after the release of massive quantities of methane during the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf. The sites offer varying concentrations of methane and other chemical and physical conditions such as oxygen concentrations and temperature that will allow us to test specific hypotheses about the role of microbial processes. Through performing the experiments with instruments right on the seafloor next to the seeps we can remove much of the uncertainty surrounding previous shipboard measurements. We will use newly developed seafloor landers equipped with advanced laser methane sensors that are capable of multi-week measurements while assaying dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and the microbial community for the presence of methane-consuming methanotrophs and their activity using advanced genomics techniques that can reveal the nature of methanotrophic responses to ambient methane concentrations. Successful collection of in situ methane consumption rate data and associated microbial community changes should prove important for modeling ocean methane dynamics over a range of oceanographic conditions including seep-enriched bottom waters and bottom waters impacted by accidental hydrocarbon releases. Graduate and undergraduate students supported by the project will gain critical skills in laboratory and field settings and will also benefit from frequent interactions with established researchers from diverse fields. Team members will participate in hands-on undergraduate education and training through developing individualized research projects leading to honors theses, presentations at national meetings and excellent graduate school placements. Graduate and undergraduates will also participate in K-12 science outreach efforts that help to attract and inform the next generation of oceanographers. The team will work with the University of North Carolina Morehead Planetarium and Science Center and participate directly in the North Carolina Science Festival. Through media contacts made from TED talks, exciting results will be broadly disseminated to the public. The project will have immediate relevance for understanding microbially mediated responses to hydrocarbon inputs from accidental releases along the Southeast Atlantic margin where oil and gas exploration are a constant topic of state and national policy discussions. Hundreds of recently discovered gas seeps along the continental margin offshore of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina plus thousands in the northern Gulf of Mexico, inject huge amounts of dissolved methane into overlying shelf and slope waters through dissolution of rising bubble plumes. The fate of the methane is largely controlled by a balance between microbial oxidation and advective transport away from seep sources. The efficacy of microbial oxidation likely depends on concentrations of methane, oxygen and ambient dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), as well as in situ pressures and temperatures. Recent shipboard aerobic methane oxidation rate (AMOR) measurements suggest that microbial consumption of seep methane may lag for a week and thus physical dispersion could dominate deepwater methane dynamics through dilution. However, methane stable carbon isotopic measurements in bottom waters suggest that there is no lag before aggressive oxidation of injected methane begins. We propose to conduct in situ measurements of AMOR while simultaneously investigating its microbial drivers at representative North Carolina and Gulf of Mexico continental margin sites featuring numerous active bubble seeps. These sites offer varying concentrations of methane and DIN; performing the experiments in situ will remove much of the uncertainty of shipboard rates. We will conduct the measurements utilizing newly developed benthic lander systems equipped with advanced laser methane sensors that are capable of multi-week AMOR measurements while assaying dissolved oxygen, DIN and the microbial community for the presence of methanotrophs (through metagenomes) and their activity (through metatranscriptomes) that can reveal the nature of methanotrophic responses to ambient methane concentrations. The project will test key hypotheses about deep-sea methane dynamics including determining if there are significant lags in microbial responses after exposure to elevated methane concentrations, determining the relationships of AMOR to methane and DIN concentrations and investigating the response times and magnitude of methanotrophs to spatial and temporal variability in methane concentration. Successful collection of in situ AMOR and associated microbial community data will prove important for modeling ocean methane dynamics over a range of oceanographic conditions including seep-enriched bottom waters and accidental hydrocarbon releases.

Safe and economical activities in such hostile and fragile regions require very insightful engineering. The presence of sea ice is representing a triple challenge: economical, technological and environmental. This makes the Arctic exploration and production activities complex.Ice Management (IM) is one of the tools that could efficiently assist to develop Arctic reserves. However, for each project that uses IM operations, a preliminary study is required to evaluate the efficiency of these support operations and to estimate the possible extension in the season of operation of a field.Efficiency of an IM philosophy can be estimated in a global view based on the extension in the operability window. In a more detailed view, it can be assessed taking into account the optimal number of icebreakers, the IM patterns, the available time for eventual disconnection, and the floe size reduction (leading to ice load reduction). For this study, we will focus on the ice floe size and loads reduction.The most common approach for physical management of sea ice is the one where icebreakers reduce floe size of the drifting ice upstream the floating platform (ref. Moran et al. [1], Coche et al. [2]). This paper describes this philosophy and demonstrates based on real-time simulation that its benefit is limited to mild ice scenarios such as unidirectional ice drift. A more efficient way to manage sea ice is (1) to identify the most hazardous events (e.g. big ridges); (2) prioritize these events; and (3) deal with them starting by the most hazardous one.",,,,,"33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 08-13, 2014JUN 08-13, 2014","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn Div","San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4556-1,,,,,,,,,"Total E&P, Paris, France",,,,2015-11-18,WOS:000363499200041,,

Currently used bias-adjustment methods differ across studies, do not explicitly account for factors that may affect initial bias estimates, and often use averaged or assumed levels of bias. We examined scavenging and detection trial data from a 3-y study at a small, terrestrial wind-farm in coastal New Jersey. Logistic regression models indicated that carcass size, substrate, and observer all affected carcass detection rates, with larger carcasses more likely to be detected than smaller carcasses, and those located on bare ground or grass more likely to be detected than those on gravel. Known-fate mark-recapture models indicated that scavenging rates were highest within the first 3 d of placement, with some variation among seasons. We suggest that empirically based estimates of factors affecting observer detection and scavenging loss be generated for individual wind-farm mortality studies, because they likely vary across sites and could heavily bias resulting adjustment factors and mortality estimates.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,7,0,7,,,1944-687X,,,,,,,,,,,"New Jersey Audubon Soc, Cape May Bird Observ, Bernardsville, NJ 08210 USA",New Jersey Audubon Soc,,,2015-01-07,WOS:000346052300011,,

Offshore inspection, both for survey where new windfarms are to be installed, and for regular maintenance of existing infrastructure, have been affected by project delays and increased costs to businesses working in the sector. RISTORE will optimize the subsea inspection of offshore renewable energy assets with an intelligent data-oriented approach. RISTORE will reduce the human presence requirement on site by deploying a system based on state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning on the edge, and the infrastructure to allow two-way communications with remote operators and analysts.The system will have benefits in several areas:* Environmental: by reducing the numbers of personnel required offshore, vessels used can be smaller and increased survey efficiency will reduce the time required at sea. This will have the effect of less fuel consumption reducing the direct environmental impact and the cost to the wind energy sector.* Cognitive load for operators: surveying tasks can be cognitively demanding and tedious. By employing machine learning, operators will be able to leverage an automated tool for inspection, increasing the efficiency and accuracy of surveys.* Increasing diversity and accessibility to the sector: by enabling onshore survey analysis and decision making, many of the barriers and restrictions to working in the sector are removed.* Sectoral resilience to COVID-19: Current restrictions now require lengthy quarantine periods and testing pre-deployment.

A synthesis of the regulatory process that has taken place over the last few years indicates that important societal decisions soon to be made by various ministries and environmental groups are going to be based on numerous disagreements between the private sector and government agencies. The review also shows that the regulatory process has taken place with a complete lack of independent oceanographic research. Yet, the Gulf of St Lawrence is a complex environment that has never been specifically studied for oil and gas exploitation. Motivated by this knowledge gap, preliminary numerical experiments are carried out where the spreading of a passive floating tracer released at Old Harry is examined. Results indicate that the tracer released at Old Harry may follow preferentially two main paths. The first path is northward along the French Shore of Newfoundland, and the second path is along the main axis of the Laurentian Channel. The most probable coastlines to be touched by water flowing through Old Harry are Cape Breton and the southern portion of the French Shore, especially Cape Anguille and the Port au Port Peninsula. The Magdalen Islands are less susceptible to being affected than those regions but the probability is not negligible.

Here we show, by leveraging metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples (189 sites, 7,560 subsamples), that bacterial, but not fungal, genetic diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than with geographic distance. We demonstrate that fungi and bacteria show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting diversity responses to precipitation and soil pH.

Numerical prediction models used for sea ice motion prediction often require a large number of data from diverse sources with varying uncertainties. In this paper, a deep learning approach is proposed to predict sea ice motion for several days in the future, given only a series of past motion observations. The proposed approach consists of an encoder-decoder network with convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) units. Optical flow is calculated from satellite passive microwave and scatterometer daily images covering the entire Arctic and used in the network. The network proves able to learn long-time dependencies within the motion time series, whereas its convolutional structure effectively captures spatial correlations among neighboring motion vectors. The approach is unsupervised and end-to-end trainable, requiring no manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in predicting sea ice motion of up to 10 days in the future, outperforming previous deep learning networks and being a promising alternative or complementary approach to resource-demanding numerical prediction methods.",,,,,,,,,29,3,0,0,0,0,31,,,0196-2892,1558-0644,,,,,,,,,,"CUNY City Coll, Dept Elect Engn, New York, NY 10031 USACUNY, Grad Ctr, Dept Comp Sci, New York, NY 10016 USA",,,,2019-09-19,WOS:000484209000044,,

Generalized estimating equations analysis was used to explore trends in the data.RESULTS: From the start of the free period, almost all participants were involved in household chores and childcare; these activities declined over the 14 days. Throughout the study period, participants actively pursued social, volunteer, and leisure time physical activities. Work-related activities were pursued by half of the participants at some time during the 14 days.

One is a spatially uniform recovery model for estimating recovery potential that reflects weathering, oil properties, and equipment efficiency. The other is a spatially nonuniform recovery model that considers not only the above characteristics but also local thickness reduction by skimming. A comparison between the two models and an analysis of their effects on response was carried out through the calculation using an accident scenario.

The eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, is an ecologically and economically important species in the northern GoM. Due to its biological characteristics (sessile, filter feeding), juvenile oysters may have been affected. This study investigated the effects of surface-collected DWH oil prepared as high-energy water-accommodated fraction (HEWAF) on the survival of 2-month-old oyster spat, and evaluated the potential impacts of HEWAF on particle clearance rate and spat tissue. Exposure of oysters to a range of oil/HEWAF (0-7-66-147-908-3450 mu g tPAH50 (sum of 50 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) L-1) resulted in non-dose-dependent mortalities and reduced clearance rates of algal food (Tisochrysis lutea). A morphometric study of the digestive tubules (DGTs) indicated a dose-dependent response to oil exposure on lumen dilation, on epithelium thinning of the DGT, and a significant change in DGT synchrony (LOEC = 66 mu g tPAH50 L-1). This finding suggests that structural changes occurred in the digestive gland of exposed oysters most likely due to an oil-related stress. In addition, histological observations showed that tissues in contact with HEWAF (gills, palp, connective tissue, digestive gland) were adversely impacted at >= 7 mu g tPAH50 L-1, and exhibited pathological symptoms typical of an inflammatory response (e.g., hemocyte diapedesis and infiltration, syncytia, epithelium sloughing).",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,0,6,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,,,,,,,"Cawthron Inst, 98 Halifax St East, Nelson 7010, New ZealandFlorida Gulf Coast Univ, Dept Marine & Ecol Sci, Coll Arts & Sci, Ft Myers, FL 33965 USAIUEM UBO, Lab Sci Environm Marin, UMR LEMAR 6539, Technopole Brest Iroise, F-29280 Plouzane, FranceVIMS, Dept Aquat Hlth Sci, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USAIFREMER, Unite Littoral, Ctr Bretagne ZI Pointe Diable, CS 10070, F-29280 Plouzane, FranceUniv North Carolina Wilmington, Bear Hall 146,601 S Coll Rd, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA",Cawthron Inst,,,2018-02-05,WOS:000419944100018,29081043,

One innovation to reduce foundation footprints involves designing foundations to move in a tolerable manner to absorb applied loads rather than being engineered to resist these loads and remain stationary. Critical design considerations are the evolution of foundation capacity and the mode of foundation displacement. The foundation should be designed to slide with acceptable settlement and rotation to prevent overstressing the joints with connected pipelines. This paper presents observations from centrifuge model tests of a mat foundation designed to slide under applied loading. The foundation is subjected to a simulated lifetime of operation, with many cycles of sliding and intervening periods of consolidation. The results provide insights to assist design, including a remarkable rise in the lateral foundation resistance over the sliding events, through repeated episodes of shearing and reconsolidation, and quantification of the accumulated settlements and rotations. The foundation is shown to translate with minimal rotation. The settlement between sliding events is more significant. This is due to the tendency for soft clay to contract on shearing, as excess pore pressures generated during sliding subsequently dissipate. The sliding-induced consolidation settlements control the tolerability of the performance of the mobile foundation.",,,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,1,0,43,,,0016-8505,1751-7656,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, Ctr Geotech Sci & Engn, Ctr Offshore Fdn Syst M053, Node ARC, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",,,,2014-12-31,WOS:000345842800004,,

This site has been selected to demonstrate the feasibility of CCS total system in which CO2 is captured from natural gas processing plants, transported to the injection site (100km away from the plants), and then stored in the saline aquifers underneath the seabed of the Japan Sea. Four technical issues have been reviewed for the surface facilities, namely CO2 transportation, removal of impurities in the CO2 gas, the liquefied CO2 heater models and the shaft seal system for CO2 pumps.As for the CO2 transportation method, tanker trucks transportation is selected compared to pipelines because of the merits in a construction period, economy, and local citizen's understanding and acceptance which are crucial for the realization of the project. Concerning process building, removal of impurities contained in the CO2 gas has been considered first. CO2 gas separated from natural gas contains hydrogen sulfide, mercury, and BTX in addition to water. These impurities must be eliminated prior to liquefaction of CO2 because they could interfere with the process as well as for environmental considerations. The adsorption method is found to be effective for removing all these impurities. However, it is also found that adsorbent consumption rate depends largely on the process sequence with which the impurities are eliminated. After reviewing the results, it is found that the most economical sequence to eliminate these impurities is in the order of mercury, hydrogen sulfide, BTX, then water.Liquefied CO2 heater models have been considered to reduce CO2 emission. After transportation to the injection site, the liquefied CO2 is pressurized and heated from -10 degrees C to a super critical state of 40 degrees C in order to avoid phase transition inside the injection tube. Using a heat pump to utilize the heat in the air to improve the energy efficiency, CO2 emission is substantially reduced by approximately 70% compared to the conventional method using hot water from a boiler that uses heavy fuel oil. A centrifugal pump will be selected for CO2 pumps because it can handle large volumes. An effective shaft seal system is the tandem formation using vapor-liquid seal and dry gas seal for the first and the second stages respectively. However, since we have limited experience of this formation at CO2 pumps in Japan, it is identified as a critical item in the demonstration project.

When combined with geomorphological and sedimentological data, the remote sensing data enable the classification of the coastline into five segments, based on whether erosional or depositional process domains dominate them. Although the 30m spatial resolution of the satellite TM data precludes precise calculation of rates of change, they do enable erosional and accretionary coastline segments of the Damietta Port Said coast to be recognised over these time scales. Segments 1 and 2 are erosional with an average shoreline recession of -41.4 m yr(-1), and -19.3 m yr(-1) respectively. Segment 3, Damietta spit, is an accretionary segment with an average shoreline advance of 81.4 m yr(-1). Segment 4, El-Deiba, experienced erosion in the period 1984-1987, with an average shoreline recession of -17 m yr(-1), but appears to have been stable over most of its length during the period 1987-1991, with observed declaration in the rate of shoreline recession to be -2.5 m yr(-1). Segment 5, El-Gamiel, was stable during the period 1984-1987, but due to the construction of projecting jetties around the mouth of the inlet and the subsequent interruption of the sediment transport supply, the coastline became accretionary updrift of the inlet (west) and erosional downdrift (east). Granulometric and heavy mineral analyses show significant differences between beach face sediment samples collected from the different coastline segments. The erosional segments are characterised by coarser sands and high concentrations of heavy minerals; while the accretionary segments are composed of finer sands with lower concentrations of heavy minerals. Poor coastal management strategies and the shortage of data on geomorphological processes along the coast has resulted in constructions taking place along sections of erosional coastline, requiring subsequent expensive defence measures. Moreover, these results have implication for future development on onshore facilities after the recent discovery of oil and gas reserves offshore.",,,,,,,,,34,4,0,0,14,0,38,,,0749-0208,,,,,,,,,,,"Fac Sci Damietta, Dept Geol, Dumyat 34517, Egypt",,,,2002-06-01,WOS:000177756400003,,

The work concerns in-service inspection for assessment of the structural integrity of engineered composite repairs applied to pipework and piping. This repair method has been used extensively in the UK North Sea and elsewhere for several years to allow ageing assets, particularly offshore platforms, to continue safe operation. Engineered composite repairs represent an attractive technical and financial proposition compared to unplanned pipe or spool replacements. Engineered composite repairs are designed, manufactured and installed to have defined lives based on the repair risk classification (representing the likelihood and consequences of failure), which are defined in current ISO[1] and ASME[2] standards. A blind trial inspection programme, using a combination of donated ex-service and manufactured components, is described. The capabilities and limitations of existing non-destructive testing (NDT) and inspection techniques are considered. The inspection information collected to date is intended to be used to prepare an inspection guidance document for assessing the condition of the substrate, the adhesive bond and the composite repair laminate. Several blind trials have now been completed, including in-service radiography, using iridium gamma sources with digital detector arrays (DDAs), as well as microwave and shearography inspection techniques. Electromagnetic inspections for three different pulsed eddy current (PEC) techniques and one magnetic eddy current (MEC) technique, using equipment from different vendors, were assessed together with a recently developed natural frequency vibrational technique called dynamic response spectroscopy (DRS)[3]. The main objective of this ongoing work, which is focused on the upstream application to pipework, is the development of an industry guidance document on composite repair inspection. The significance and criticality of defects, the extension of defined life repairs and the improved understanding of the long-term adhesion performance are key parameters required for possible life extension and are beyond the scope of this paper.",,,,,57th Annual British Conference on Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)57th Annual British Conference on Non-Destructive Testing (NDT),"SEP, 2018SEP, 2018",,"Nottingham, ENGLANDNottingham, ENGLAND",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1354-2575,1754-4904,,,,,,,,,,"ESR Technol, 22 East Cent,127 Olymp Ave,Milton Pk, Abingdon OX14 4SA, Oxon, EnglandConoco Phillips, Houston, TX USASpirit Energy, Aberdeen, Scotland",ESR TechnolSpirit Energy,,,2019-03-19,WOS:000460584400005,,

Crude oil causes both lethal and sublethal effects on marine organisms, and sensory systems have the potential to be strongly affected. Marine fishes rely upon the effective functioning of their sensory systems for detection of prey, mates, and predators. However, despite the obvious importance of sensory systems, the impact of crude oil exposure upon sensory function remains largely unexplored. Here we show that olfactory organ responses to amino acids are significantly depressed in oil exposed stingrays. We found that the response magnitude of the electro-olfactogram (EOG) to 1 mM amino acids decreased by an average of 45.8% after 48 h of exposure to an oil concentration replicating that measured in coastal areas. Additionally, in oil exposed individuals, the EOG response onset was significantly slower, and the clearing time was protracted. This study is the first to employ an electrophysiological assay to demonstrate crude oil impairment of the olfactory system in a marine fish. We show that stingrays inhabiting an area impacted by an oil spill experience reduced olfactory function, which would detrimentally impact fitness, could lead to premature death, and could cause additional cascading effects through lower trophic levels.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,10,0,13,,,2045-2322,,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USAFlorida Inst Technol, Dept Ocean Engn & Marine Sci, 150 West Univ Blvd, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA",,,,2018-11-06,WOS:000448270800006,30361507,

Consequently, there are regulatory guidelines regarding the monitoring of structural integrity for continuous safe operation. The size of installations and the cost of implementing work offshore have led to the requirement for fast and reliable inspection techniques to provide the necessary data on structural integrity One of those techniques is Flooded Member Detection (FMD), which involves the detection of water in normally air-filled members of steel jacket installations.

Risers, as the channel between platform and wellhead, play a key role in oil and gas transportation. Subjected to coarse environmental conditions and uncertain loading patterns, risers would display complex dynamic behaviors which could result in severe fatigue damages. Recently, riser response is commonly measured using passive and durable Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) strain sensors for industry safety, especially for Integrity Management (IM). However, for technique difficulties as well as economical consideration, it is impossible to execute distributed fatigue monitoring on the whole riser, which makes it essential to find out an optimized method utilizing the least number of sensors and reconstruct the global response of risers. This paper propose a method which combines H-2 norms and Kalman filter to give optimal state estimation of risers based on limited FBG-based dynamic strain information. The H-2 norms are used to give guideline for optimized sensor placement. Meanwhile, Kalman filter realize the global response reconstruction of risers as well as minimize the environmental disturbance.

We suggest that developing a large-scale, visible, and financially viable CCUS network could potentially overcome many barriers to deployment and jumpstart commercial-scale CCUS. To date, substantial effort has focused on technology development to reduce the costs of CO2 capture from coal-fired power plants. Here, we propose that near-term investment could focus on implementing CO2 capture on facilities that produce high-value chemicals/products. These facilities can absorb the expected impact of the marginal increase in the cost of production on the price of their product, due to the addition of CO2 capture, more than coal-fired power plants. A financially viable demonstration of a large-scale CCUS network requires offsetting the costs of CO2 capture by using the CO2 as an input to the production of market-viable products. We demonstrate this alternative development path with the example of an integrated CCUS system where CO2 is captured from ethylene producers and used for enhanced oil recovery in the US Gulf Coast region.

In the northern Gulf of Mexico, sperm whales are exposed to a variety of anthropogenic stressors, including ship strikes, fisheries interactions, habitat loss and degradation due to oil and gas development, and chemical and noise pollution. In particular, they are exposed to high levels of anthropogenic noises related to geological and geophysical surveys for hydrocarbon deposits. The sounds produced by these surveys could reduce sensory volume, increase search effort required to locate resources, and interfere with auditory signal processing critical to foraging success. We developed a stochastic life-stage structured bioenergetic model to evaluate the consequences of reduced foraging efficiency on carbohydrate, lipid, and protein reserves in the blubber, muscle, and viscera. The model indicates that individual resilience to foraging disruptions is primarily a function of size (i.e. reserve capacity) and daily energetic demands. Mothers are the most vulnerable life stage due to the high energy demands associated with pregnancy and lactation. Continuous disruption has a greater impact than intermittent disruption; even minor foraging disruptions may lead to terminal starvation if the whales have no opportunity to replenish reduced reserves. Infrequent, minor disruptions in foraging are unlikely to be fatal, but may result in reduced body reserves that may be associated with reduced reproductive success.

This paper examines belowground production and soil carbon of a high-latitude saltmarsh in the StLawrence Estuary (Quebec, Canada), which had been subjected to six years of sheep grazing. In the seventh year, without sheep, organic matter production in grazed and ungrazed sections was assessed by examining harvests of plant litter, end-of-season standing crop, and the roots and rhizomes present in in-growth cores. Excepting salinity, porewater chemistry varied little. The grazed marsh had higher soil carbon density and belowground production, yet lower aboveground biomass. Grazing reduces plant litter and increases solar exposure, soil temperature (at this latitude, soil remained frozen until April) and evapotranspiration, thus raising soil salinity and nitrogen demand, the latter a driver of root production. Grazing may not be detrimental to soil carbon storage.

A proposed method to increase the workability is the use of a floating wave barrier (FWB). This FWB can be a specific structure designed for this purpose, or, as in this case, a barge used for the transportation of the structures that will then be installed by the sheerlegs crane barge.This paper discusses the effects of a FWB on the first-order motions of the sheerlegs crane barge. Dependent on the environmental conditions, the use of a FWB can decrease the first-order motions of the vessel and increase its workability on that particular phase in the total installation sequence. When applied on the phase with the lowest workability in the installation process, this can result in a higher overall workability.

Similar evaluations for chemicals used in other routine oil and gas development activities, such as maintenance acidizing, gravel packing, and well drilling, have not been previously conducted, in part due to a lack of reliable information concerning on-field chemical-use. In this study, we compare chemical-use between routine activities and the more closely regulated well-stimulation activities using data collected by the South Coast Air Quality Monitoring District (SCAQMD), which mandates the reporting of both unconventional and routine on-field chemical-use for parts of Southern California. Analysis of this data shows that there is significant overlap in chemical-use between so-called unconventional activities and routine activities conducted for well maintenance, well-completion, or rework. A comparison within the SCAQMD shows a significant overlap between both types and amounts of chemicals used for well-stimulation treatments included under State mandatory-disclosure regulations and routine treatments that are not included under State regulations. A comparison between SCAQMD chemical-use for routine treatments and state-wide chemical-use for hydraulic fracturing also showed close similarity in chemical-use between activities covered under chemical disclosure requirements (e.g. hydraulic fracturing) and many other oil and gas field activities. The results of this study indicate regulations and risk assessments focused exclusively on chemicals used in well-stimulation activities may underestimate potential hazard or risk from overall oil field chemicaluse.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,7,0,21,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Area, Berkeley, CA USAUniv Pacific, Sch Engn & Comp Sci, Ecol Engn Res Program, 3601 Pacific Ave, Stockton, CA 95211 USAPSE Hlth Energy, 1440 Broadway,Suite 205, Oakland, CA 94612 USAUniv Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",PSE Hlth Energy,,,2017-05-24,WOS:000399875600030,28422971,

The three formulas enhance previous published theoretical estimates and are consistent with each other in that any one of them can be used depending on which two of the following three input parameters are known: (i) the variation in water level at either end of the channel (or just at the ocean end for a channel connected to an enclosed bay); (ii) the peak undisturbed natural flow rate through the channel; or (iii) the approximate channel geometry and seabed drag coefficient. The formulas are derived using an electrical analogy of the dynamics of flow through a channel. Example calculations are given and the results compare favourably with previous estimates of power potential by alternative theoretical formulas and detailed numerical models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The ASPECT aircraft was released from service on August 9, 2010 after having flown over 75 missions that included over 250 hours of flight operation. ASPECT's initial mission responsibility was to provide air quality monitoring (i.e., identification of vapor species) during various oil burning operations. The ASPECT airborne wide-area infrared remote sensing spectral data was used to evaluate the hazard potential of vapors being produced from open water oil burns near the Deepwater Horizon rig site. Other significant remote sensing data products and innovations included the development of an advanced capability to correctly identify, locate, characterize, and quantify surface oil that could reach beaches and wetland areas. This advanced identification product provided the Incident Command an improved capability to locate surface oil in order to improve the effectiveness of oil skimmer vessel recovery efforts directed by the US Coast Guard. This paper discusses the application of infrared spectroscopy and multispectral infrared imagery to address significant issues associated with this national crisis.

Given this situation, it is prudent for society to explore all potential carbon management options, including those with seemingly low probability for success. Recent initiatives for advancing and enhancing carbon storage options have focused primarily on the physical trapping of CO2 in underground geologic formations and on the biological uptake of CO2; less attention has been given to approaches that rely primarily on geochemical reactions that enhance transformation of CO2 gas into dissolved or solid phase carbon by liberating cations to neutralize carbonic acid. This paper provides a structured review of the technical status of these geochemical approaches, and also presents a simple framework for assessing the potential and limitations of various proposed geochemical approaches to assist prioritizing future research in this area. Despite major limitations, geochemical approaches have unique potential to contribute to CO2 reductions in ways that neither physical nor biological carbon storage can by allowing for the direct removal of CO2 from the atmosphere with minimal requirements for integrating with existing infrastructure. Recognizing the severity and urgency of the need for carbon management options, we argue for an increase in research activity related to geochemical approaches to carbon management.",,,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,6,0,38,,,0165-0009,1573-1480,,,,,,,,,,"Clark Univ, Dept Int Dev Community & Environm, Environm Sci & Policy Program, Worcester, MA 01610 USAUniv Calgary, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",,,,2008-10-01,WOS:000259186800002,,

NPT, according to many credible references, is the primary step to ascertain well integrity during any offshore drilling. This paper introduces a three-layer, conceptual risk analysis framework to assess the critical role of human and organizational factors in conducting and interpreting a negative pressure test. This framework has been developed by generalizing the risk assessment model that was proposed by the authors for the analysis of the conducted NPT by the DWH crew. In addition, the application of the introduced framework in this study is not limited to NPT misinterpretation. In fact, it can be generalized and be potentially useful for the risk analysis of future oil and gas drilling as well as other high-risk operations. Analysis of the developed framework in this paper confirms the results of previous studies by indicating that organizational factors are root causes of accumulated errors and questionable decisions made by personnel or management. Further analysis of this framework identifies procedural issues, economic pressure, and personnel management issues as the organizational factors with the highest influence on misinterpreting a negative pressure test. It is noteworthy that the captured organizational factors in the introduced conceptual framework are not only specific to the scope of the NPT.

Mola Mola is a 2000 meter rated hovering vehicle that records digital images with its primary sensor an AVT industrial camera typically from three meters altitude. Currently these AUVs provide deep site reconnaissance for instrument deployments and bathymetric and sub bottom surveys of selected areas for the Ecosystem Impacts of Oil and Gas Inputs to the Gulf (ECOGIG) consortium.

The Mola Mola AUV is used for close-up high resolution photographic site investigations. The combination of these two AUV's is providing a unique tool to study seafloor morphology, sub bottom structure and provide high resolution imagery of targets of interest [ 3].

We propose that outcomes of interventions can be explained in terms of rights, incentives, and technologies related to land use and apply this framework to examine 12 types of interventions in agriculture-forest landscapes. The analysis of the identified 123 cases raises concerns about consistency of data and comparability of cases. Our preliminary evidence suggests limited association between the stated objective of an intervention and its success. This evidence also suggests that smaller scale and effective enforcement may be positively associated with improved forest outcomes. But the effectiveness of interventions across different agriculture-forest landscapes varies and available evidence does not permit easy generalizations. The variable effects of interventions across different agriculture-forest landscapes point to the need to better understand the forms and functions of interventions and to problems associated with assessing their relative efficacy.

J,,,,,,,,,William McCaffrey,,Knowledge to application: meta data approaches to improved geological model conditioning in petroleum industry workflows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2015,2015,"Sedimentary rocks are commonly highly variable internally. For example when rivers leave behind sediments, channel deposits may sit within floodplain deposits, such that ribbons of sand become encased within a muddy background. To describe and study sedimentary systems such as these, sedimentologists use descriptive terms such as channel or floodplain to recognise building blocks that together stack up to build a rock volume. These building blocks are called architectural elements. Geologists also recognise that architectural elements may themselves stack up in organised patterns, and such organised patterns of elements can be placed in hierarchical arrangements. For example, channels may stack together to form channel complexes, and channel complexes may build channel complex sets. This hierarchical descriptive approach can work in the deposits from a wide range of sedimentary environments: e.g., rivers (fluvial rocks), shallow seas (shallow marine rocks) and deep seas (deep marine clastic rocks). Sedimentary systems built from pre-existing particles (such as sand grains, or mud grains, that might make sand- or mud-stones) are known as clastic systems. In the right circumstances, such systems may form hydrocarbon reservoirs. This happens when the sediment is buried, but with connected pores between the grains still open (i.e., without minerals growing in the pores during burial to seal the rock). If oil or gas migrates into connected pore spaces, but cannot migrate out, because the rock above is sealed in some way, the hydrocarbon filled rock volume may have the potential to be an oil or gas reservoir, if there is enough hydrocarbon in place, and the predicted flow rates are high enough.To predict whether a known hydrocarbon accumulation might make an economic reservoir - i.e., be worth developing - oil companies model its behaviour as a possible field. They may first build a sedimentary model, recognising different architectural elements and the way they are stacked together. They will then account for any deformation the rock experienced during or post deposition. Finally they will simplify this geological model to build a reservoir simulation model, in which the performance of the possible field can be predicted. Ideally the company would build the geological model using seismic reflection data that showed the basic geology (this is a remote sensing technique that builds 2- or 3D images of the subsurface geology based on processing the reflections of sound waves sent into the ground). However, the resolution of these techniques is usually not good enough to show exactly what the subsurface geology is like, and the companies have to use models to fill in the data they can't see directly. To build these models, companies commonly use computer techniques to generate synthetic geology at the finer scale, using algorithms that randomly generate patterns of architectural elements based upon modelling rules. However, problems often arise because these rules are not always based upon the way the geology actually tends to stack together in particular settings. The database approach is a new way of determining what these organisational rules should be. They provide data that are more reliable, because the data are all compiled from real world examples of geology. We have already applied this approach to rocks deposited by rivers, and in the deep sea, and many companies have used the results in their own modelling. However, the approach hasn't been tried yet for shallow marine rocks - and that's what we aim to do in this project. Shallow marine rocks host many oil and gas fields, so if we can improve the modelling of such fields, we'll have a significant impact upon the efficiency of the companies who use the technique, as we'll reduce the uncertainly they commonly experience when deciding whether or not to develop a field, and how to extend the lives of fields that are already producing.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/M007324/1,,,,,,,,University of Leeds,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15341967,,

In this study, we surveyed the influence of such land cover changes on four land cover/uses including closed canopy forest, tree fallow, shrub fallow, and degraded land among 120 study sites. We assessed these changes on total carbon stocks including both aboveground biomass (AGB) and soil organic carbon (SOC) including both topsoil, 0-30 cm, and deep soil, 30-100 cm. The four land cover/uses were located within four regions (Andasibe, Didy, Anjahamana, and Lakato) in the Eastern humid tropical forest of Madagascar. Our results show that total carbon stocks, AGB and soil, average 166 +/- 57 Mg C ha(-1) in which 82% is stored in 0-100 cm of soil surface horizon (55% stored in the topsoil and 27% in deep soil) suggesting the importance of soil pools in the sequestration of atmospheric carbon. The total carbon stocks were significantly higher in closed canopy compared to the other land covers. In lower altitude regions, the total carbon stock was lower ranging from 143.5 Mg C ha(-1) to 163.7 Mg C ha(-1), relative to higher altitude areas where total C stock ranged from 170.6 Mg C ha(-1) to 186.1 Mg C ha(-1). The relative importance of AGB and SOC were reversed in these study sites, with AGB/ SOC ratios of 0.37 for Anjahamana, 0.17 for Lakato, 0.21 for Didy, and 0.17 for Andasibe. Climatic factor combined with soil properties could explain the SOC variations across the study regions. High SOC was related to lower precipitation, high clay content and high root development. These results provide an accurate assessment of carbon storage distribution in a tropical region and support the importance of forest conservation and effective land cover management in maintaining carbon storage in ecosystems as tools in climate change mitigation in tropical forests.

The discovery of the remains of the Royal Navy warship HMS Swift off the coast of Patagonia, South America, which was wrecked in 1770 while undertaking a survey from its base in the Falkland/Malvinas Islands, has afforded the opportunity for a first-pass Raman spectroscopic study of the contents of several glass jars from a wooden chest, some of which had suffered deterioration of their contents owing to leakage through their stoppers. From the Raman spectroscopic data, it was possible to identify organic compounds such as anthraquinone and copal resin, which were empirically used as materia medica in the eighteenth century to treat shipboard diseases; it seems very likely, therefore, that the wooden chest belonged to the barber-surgeon on the ship. Spectra were obtained from the wet and desiccated samples, but several samples from containers that had leaked were found to contain only minerals, such as aragonite and sediment.This article is part of the themed issue 'Raman spectroscopy in art and archaeology'.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1364-503X,,,,,,,,,,,"Division of Chemical and Forensic Sciences, School of Life Sciences, University of Bradford, Bradford BD7 1DP, West Yorkshire, UK h.g.m.edwards@bradford.ac.uk.CONICET, Programa de Arqueologia Subacuatica, Instituto Nacional de Antropologia y Pensamiento Latinoamericano, 3 de Febrero 1378 (1426), Buenos Aires, Argentina.Universidad de Buenos Aires.

The objectives of this study are to estimate the economic impact of SDS on the oil and gas industry in Kuwait, to estimate a risk index for each loss, and to recommend a sustainable system for the mitigation of the damaging effects and economic losses of infrastructures. Hot spots of wind erosion, wind corridors, and dust frequency and severity formed the basis to locate the most susceptible oil and gas fields and operations. Ten sectors with potential loss vulnerabilities were evaluated: exploration, drilling, production, gas, marine, soil remediation, project management, water handling, maintenance, and research and development. Sand encroachment, although not a sector per se, was also considered. The results indicate that sand, and to lesser extent dust, are damaging and costly to the oil and gas infrastructure of Kuwait, with an economic cost estimation of US$9.36 million, a total of 5159 nonproductive lost hours, and 347,310 m(3) of annual sand removal. A risk assessment identified three sectors with the highest risk indices (RI): drilling (RI = 25), project management (RI = 20), and maintenance (RI = 16). Sand encroachment also constituted a high risk (RI = 25). Mitigation of sand storms using a hybrid biological-mechanical system was shown to be cost-effective with an equivalent saving of 4.6 years of sand encroachment. The hazard implications of sand storm events continue to be a major concern for policy-makers given their detrimental economic impacts, and require that government officials wisely allocate investment budgets to effectively control and mitigate their damaging effects.",,,,,,,,,50,1,0,0,15,0,51,,,2071-1050,,,,,,,,,,,"Kuwait Inst Sci Res, Environm & Life Sci Res Ctr, Crisis & Decis Support Program, Safat 13109, KuwaitKuwait Inst Sci Res, Technoecon Div, Safat 13109, KuwaitDirectorate Gen Civil Aviat, Meteorol Dept, POB 35, Hawalli 32001, Kuwait",Directorate Gen Civil Aviat,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000457127300200,,

The strategies of sustainable energy in China are brought forward accordingly, and the corresponding implementations of sustainable energy development in China are expounded as well. Note that the development of clean coal and nuclear power with innovative technologies can vigorously promote China's sustainable development since renewable energy as a whole, with the exception of hydro power, is still very small compared with conventional generation.

We present a case study of integrated, high resolution data (core, image logs, and seismic) from Thunder Horse, one of the largest deepwater oil and gas discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico, to illustrate how mass transport complexes can both compartmentalize and pond reservoirs. The key data type enabling these conclusions are image logs, which reveal erosive mass transport complexes whose emplacement removed the upper portion of one of the Thunder Horse sandstone reservoirs on the northwest side of the asset and resedimented the sand as multiple smaller compartments.Stacked seafloor landslide deposits interbedded with turbidite sandstone reservoirs are herein characterized in detail from image logs at Thunder Horse, located in lower Mississippi Canyon. Dips from bedding boundaries on image logs in the sandstone reservoirs show little variation in structural tilt (< 20 degrees), indicating continuous deposition by high density turbidity currents prior to major structural deformation, and are thus the best proxy for regional structural dip. In contrast, dips in 85% of all mudrocks in this area show widely varying dip magnitude and azimuth over small and large scales, and are interpreted as having been deposited by slumps, slides, and folds, building up to form mass transport complexes. Only very rarely (2% of strata) do we observe mudrock dips that are conformable to the regional dip and strike.Unconformable bedding contacts at the tops of the sandstone reservoirs in northern Thunder Horse suggest scouring and erosion, whereas basal sandstone contacts are in conformance with overall structural dip, suggesting amalgamation. On seismic data, the mass transport complexes stack and mound together, forming a paleo-topographic high with at least 30 m of relief. Core acquired in this mudrock-dominated deposit reveals convoluted and folded bedding capped by 0.5 m of highly bioturbated marl that is interpreted as a Glossifungites hiatal surface. The implication is that the mass transport complexes formed a topographic obstacle that diverted subsequent debris and turbidite flows, and later created localized ponding and thickening of the overlying reservoir. Thus, mass transport complexes were found to both erode and augment sandstone reservoirs. Biostratigraphic dating of the two reservoirs brackets their deposition as occurring in < 400,000 years during the Serravalian, Middle Miocene, probably as a result of the Harang shelf failure.As a case study this type of integrated, high resolution data has wide applicability to other deepwater, sub-salt reservoirs, as improved structural and depositional interpretations inform reservoir performance and impact future well plans. Further, recognition of mass transport complexes as agents of reservoir compartmentalization and sandstone ponding allows for more accurate reserves estimation.",,,,,,,,,7,1,0,0,0,0,10,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"BP, 501 Westlake Pk Blvd, Houston, TX 77079 USAEriksfiord, 1001 S Dairy Ashford St, Houston, TX 77077 USA",Eriksfiord,,,2018-11-16,WOS:000449128000042,,

Firstly, the mathematical model of the moored FPSO in terms of kinematics and dynamics is established. Secondly, the catenary method is applied to analyze the mooring line dynamics, and mathematical model of one single mooring line is set up based on the catenary equation. Thereafter, mathematical model for the whole turret mooring system is established. Thirdly, a structural reliability index is defined to evaluate the breaking strength of each mooring line. At the same time, control constraints are also considered to design a state feedback controller using the backstepping technique. Finally, a series of simulation tests are carried out for a certain turret-moored FPSO with eight mooring lines. It is shown in the simulation results that the moored FPSO can keep its position well in extreme seas.

Remote sensing with new wave radar systems allows remote wave and current field observation, reducing data contamination associated with traditional submerged upward/horizontal-looking acoustic meters. These instruments are relatively new to the industry and are participating in ongoing validation studies to gain further acceptance within the industry. Shell Exploration and Production Corporation (Shell E&P) operates a network of offshore oil and gas installations in the north and central Gulf of Mexico that have maintained a variety of oceanographic sensors for many years in support of operations. Shell E&P has recently expanded their Metocean observation capacity, to include both LiDAR wind profilers and microwave wave radars, in addition to existing ocean current profilers. To date more than a year's worth of LiDAR and radar wave and current data has been collected at tension leg platforms (TLP) Ursa and Olympus, observing a full range of meteorological and oceanographic conditions, representative of the region, including the passage hurricanes Harvey and Nate. In addition, an upward looking near surface Acoustic Wave and Current profiler (AWAC) has simultaneously been collecting data at the nearby Mars TLP.The present study evaluates the variability in the wave system response, the comparison between the three stations, the correlation between the radar current observations and wave signals, and the ability of the measurement systems to successfully capture normal as well as extreme conditions. The observations showed a good correlation between the three stations, showing a transition from wind sea to swell as the peak of hurricane Nate passes. The data also showed the presence of orthogonal wind sea and swell wave systems after the storm peak at both Ursa and Olympus, although the Mars AWAC had been pulled for the storm. All three wave and current meters were deployed during the passage of more remote hurricane Harvey however. Surface currents showed a clear response to the wind speed and direction but were temporally offset from the near-surface currents.

There is considerable potential for these schemes to operate in drylands which are spatially extensive. However, projects in these environments risk failure through unplanned release of stored carbon to the atmosphere. In this review, we identify factors that may adversely affect the success of vegetation-based carbon abatement projects in dryland ecosystems, evaluate their likelihood of occurrence, and estimate the potential consequences for carbon storage and sequestration. We also evaluate management strategies to reduce risks posed to these carbon abatement projects. Identified risks were primarily disturbances, including unplanned fire, drought, and grazing. Revegetation projects also risk recruitment failure, thereby failing to reach projected rates of sequestration. Many of these risks are dependent on rainfall, which is highly variable in drylands and susceptible to further variation under climate change. Resprouting vegetation is likely to be less vulnerable to disturbance and have faster recovery rates upon release from disturbance. We conclude that there is a strong impetus for identifying management strategies and risk reduction mechanisms for carbon abatement projects. Risk mitigation would be enhanced by effective co-ordination of mitigation strategies at scales larger than individual abatement project boundaries, and by implementing risk assessment throughout project planning and implementation stages. Reduction of risk is vital for maximising carbon sequestration of individual projects and for reducing barriers to the establishment of new projects entering the market. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Projections of POC export can also be quantified using an alternative physiologically-based approach, the Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE). MTE employs an activation energy (Ea) describing organismal metabolic sensitivity to temperature change, but does not consider changes in ocean chemistry or physics. Many ESMs incorporate temperature dependent functions, where rates (e.g., respiration) scale with temperature. Temperature sensitivity describes how temperature dependence varies across metabolic rates or species. ESMs acknowledge temperature sensitivity between rates (e.g., between heterotrophic and autotropic processes), but due to a lack of empirical data cannot parameterize for variation within rates, such as differences within species or biogeochemical provinces. Here we investigate how varying temperature sensitivity affects heterotrophic microbial respiration and hence future POC export. Using satellite-derived data and ESM temperature projections we applied microbial MTE, with varying temperature sensitivity, to estimates of global POC export. In line with observations from polar regions and the deep ocean we imposed an elevated temperature sensitivity (Ea = 1.0 eV) to cooler regions; firstly to the Southern Ocean (south of 40°S) and secondly where temperature at 100 m depth a was set to 0.7 eV (moderate sensitivity/classic MTE). Imposing high temperature sensitivity in cool regions resulted in projected declines in export of 17 1% (a = 0.7 eV globally) or ESMs (1-12%). The sparse observational data currently available suggests metabolic temperature sensitivity of organisms likely differs depending on the oceanic province they reside in. We advocate temperature sensitivity to be incorporated in biogeochemical models to improve projections of future carbon export, which could be currently underestimating the change in future POC export.

However, significant challenges in assessing their stability and dynamic performance under large storm loading remain. For instance, their long slender truss-work legs and large inverted conical spudcan footings cause the natural period of the jack-up to approach the dominant frequency of ocean waves. The spudcan stiffness is also non-linear and requires a methodology to integrate it numerically within the environmental loading and structural analysis. Modern jack-ups are also increasing in size. Spacing of over 50 m between legs requires accurate evaluation of both the magnitude and timing of storm loads on each leg. To address these issues, this paper details a methodology for numerically integrating the fluid, structure and soil behaviour for large three-legged jack-ups. A six-degree-of-freedom strain-hardening plasticity model for integrating the load-displacement behaviour of spudcan footings into three-dimensional structural analysis is reviewed. It will be shown that non-linear behaviour of soils can be accommodated within an established theoretical framework, and as the response of the foundation is expressed in terminology consistent with structural mechanics, the models can be coupled directly to the numerical analysis of a structure. The influence of the spatial variability and directional wave spreading on jack-up response is also investigated. Example analyses of a jack-up installed in sand highlight the effect of wave direction, spreading function and foundation modeling assumption on the dynamic jack-up response.",,,,,,,,,7,6,0,0,0,0,12,,,1226-7988,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, Ctr Offshore Fdn Syst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",,,,2011-05-20,WOS:000290042200003,,

There are standards to identify and record workplace accidents and incidents to provide guiding means on prevention efforts, indicating specific failures or reference, means of correction of conditions or circumstances that culminated in an accident. Therefore, events recognition is central to OHS, since the system can selectively start proper prediction services according to the user current situation and past knowledge taken from huge databases. In this sense, a fusion framework that combines data from multiples sources to achieve more specific inferences is needed. In this paper we propose a machine learning algorithm to learn from past anomalous events related to accident events in time and space. It also uses additional knowledge, like the contextual knowledge: user profile, event location and time, etc. Our proposed model provides the big picture about risk analysis for that employee at that place in that moment in a real world environment.

J,,,,,,,,,William Edward Newns Austin,,Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environments (C-SIDE),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,May 31 2018,2018,"The Earth's climate is warming and sea levels are rising around the globe, flooding and eroding our coasts. One important type of coastal environment that is at risk are saltmarshes. These are vegetated tidal flats that are tucked away in sheltered embayments, where there is a gradual transition between the land and sea. They also occur in more exposed locations where they form a natural defence against the encroaching sea. Saltmarshes are also valuable because the plants that grow on them absorb carbon at a very fast pace, much faster than, for example, trees. Saltmarshes are therefore useful in taking carbon out of the atmosphere and storing it away. Because carbon in the atmosphere is important in controlling the Earth's temperature, storing carbon in the ground can help reduce climate change.The vegetation on a saltmarsh is close to the level of the highest tides. Every time the tide comes in, a thin layer of mud is deposited on top of the saltmarsh surface. Over time, the saltmarsh mud gets thicker, but it can only increase in thickness if sea level goes up. So in that sense, sea-level rise can be beneficial to saltmarshes, because if the amount of mud gets thicker they can perhaps store more carbon and reduce climate change further! It is a new idea. Whether it is actually true is what we want to find out.As always, things aren't so simple. Apart from sea-level rise, there are other factors that can play a role in changing the amount of carbon buried in a saltmarsh, for example the tides, the availability of sediment, the types of plants, and whether the marsh is sheltered or exposed to the sea. We have picked 7 coastal regions in Britain that are all slightly different to analyse these different factors. Sea-level rise, the part we think is most important, is much faster in the south, where coasts are sinking, compared to Scotland, where the land is going up ever so slightly. We can treat Britain as a 'natural laboratory' to answer global questions: What controls carbon uptake in saltmarshes? Is sea-level rise beneficial? We expect that our studies will teach us lessons for saltmarshes around the world.What will we do? We have designed our project into five parts. In part 1 we will look at the salt marsh mud in the past and present. We will measure how thick the mud is by coring and by running equipment which can 'see' below the ground. We will collect four cores at each of the 7 sites and use radioactive dating methods to tell us how old these sediments are. This is important because sea-level change has varied through time and rose much faster in the last 100 years than before. We will also measure the build-up of mud in the present day. In part 2 we will measure how much carbon is stored both above and below the ground. We will survey the plants which are growing on the marsh and then measure them further in the laboratory. We will measure the amount of carbon in the cores we collected, and do analyses to find out where the carbon came from (from the marsh vegetation itself or washed in with the tide). Experiments with buried tea bags will allow us to find out how much carbon is lost from dead plants during burial. And we will recruit members of the general public to help us with sampling so that we can cover more saltmarshes. We have an app for this. In part 3 and 4 we will gather data from various sources and multiply the data from our 7 sites to find out how representative our findings are for the whole of Britain. All saltmarshes will be mapped in 3 dimensions. We will collect data on all environmental factors and find out which ones can predict how much carbon is in saltmarshes using statistics and computer models. The final part 5 is all about the benefits of this project. We will use our results to recommend how managers of coastlines may be able to make use of saltmarshes to help fight climate change and sea-level rise, for example by establishing new saltmarshes on old coastal farmland.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/R010846/1,,,,,,,,University of St Andrews,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15310498,,

The development of FLNG will allow floating plants to be positioned in remote offshore areas and subsequently produce, liquefy, store and offload LNG in the one position. The offloading process from an FLNG platform to a gas tanker can be a high risk operation. It consists of LNG being transferred, in hostile environments, through loading arms or flexible cryogenic hoses into a carrier which then transports the LNG to onshore facilities. During the carrier's offloading process at onshore terminals, it again involves risk that may result in an accident such as collision, leakage and/or grounding. It is therefore critical to assess and monitor all risks associated with the offloading operation. This study is aimed at developing a novel methodology using Bayesian Network (BN) to conduct the dynamic safety analysis for the offloading process of an LNG carrier. It investigates different risk factors associated with LNG offloading procedures in order to predict the probability of undesirable accidents. Dynamic failure assessment using Bayesian theory can estimate the likelihood of the occurrence of an event. It can also estimate the failure probability of the safety system and thereby develop a dynamic failure assessment tool for the offloading process at a particular FLNG plant. The main objectives of this paper are: to understand the LNG offloading process, to identify hazardous events during offloading operation, and to perform failure analysis (modelling) of critical accidents and/or events. Most importantly, it is to evaluate and compare risks. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to validate the risk models and to study the behaviour of the most influential factors. The results have indicated that collision is the most probable accident to occur during the offloading process of an LNG carrier at berth, which may have catastrophic consequences.

In order to avoid excessive stresses on platform, which is highly inertial object, it consists of few large parts (normally base and legs). Four friction pendulum bearings are used for mechanical link between the base and legs. The bearings functionality is to provide the protection of the platform from all possible mechanical loadings on the legs that might affect the base with the drill and other sensitive equipment. Mechanical loadings include different seismic movements, ice shifts, mechanical loadings during the drilling, heat expansion stress, etc. Bearings are worn out after certain distance traveled and have to be replaced when the movement resource is over.The most important parameter, which allows estimation the bearing resource, is measuring the cumulative distance traveled by the bearing from the beginning of its service with the relative accuracy better then 0,01%, and absolute displacement at 350 mm range with accuracy better then I mm. For this purpose the automatic optical-electronic system for measurements of bearings movements was developed. Its main aim is continuous noncontact measurement of the bearing location and calculation of the total distance traveled by the bearing for any defined time period.Measuring principle of the system is based on optical image processing. The passive part of the system (optical target) is fixed on one part of construction while active part - a field measurement sensor (FMS) is installed on another part of construction that moves relative to the first one. The FMS continuously captures and processes the image of optical target. On the FMS output, after processing, the relative displacement between FMS and Optical Target is obtained with high degree of accuracy.The system was certified as a measuring tool as well as for the use in explosive environments (for gas and oil industry).

CO(2)e emissions abatement costs were estimated by comparing two alternatives. The first alternative (baseline) considers that the volume of NG flared will not be reduced. Low-sulfur fuels (diesel and naphtha) will be obtained by investing in treatment units in Brazilian refineries. These are hydrotreating units for unstable compounds and hydrodesulfurizer units for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) naphtha. Currently in Brazilian refineries, without any investment, the lower-quality streams that should be removed from diesel and gasoline pools to comply with higher specifications are light-cycle oil and FCC naphtha, respectively. The second alternative considers an offshore microchannel GTL plant producing synthetic crude oil, or syncrude. The upgrading of this syncrude is done by a mild-hydrocracking unit. This alternative allows the production of low-sulfur diesel, reducing gas flaring and co-producing high-quality naphtha. The results show that CO(2)e emissions abatement costs of offshore GTL in Brazil should range between negative US$ 2.00 and positive 80-00/tCO(2)e.

The current production of less than 1000 barrels of oil per day (<50,000 t/a) ranks Georgia as number 104 among the oil producing nations.Since Georgia's independence from Soviet Union in 1991, quite a number of international oil companies have taken licenses and pursued pretty diverging business strategies. Classical E&P companies remained a minority compared to the number of 'financial investors sometimes more soldiers of fortune than wildcatters.Georgia used to have an investor friendly PSA policy; attractiveness of conditions for new licenses has ceased during the last couple of years, although, to some degree, terms are still negotiable.Embedded between the High Caucasus and the Lesser Caucasus mountains the Rioni Basin towards the Black Sea in the west and the larger Kura Basin near and east of Tbilisi are the country's two petroleum regions.

A total of 96 samples (48 coastal sediments and 48 tar balls) were taken from eight sampling points at the BP coast during the summer of 2014. These samples were analyzed to identify the sources and characteristics of their organic matter using diagnostic ratios and fingerprint analysis based on the distribution of the source-specific biomarkers of n-alkanes, PAHs,(1) hopanes and steranes. Mean concentration of n-alkanes (mu g g(-1) dw) and PAHs (ng g(-1) dw) varied respectively from 405 to 220,626, and 267 to 23,568 in coastal sediments, while ranged respectively from 664 to 145,285 and 390 to 46,426 in tar balls.

There is a strong willing to deploy robust and reliable technologies to ensure the safety and integrity of CO2 underground storages. Here we present a dataset acquired in the Eifel volcanic district, using geochemical monitoring methods focussing on both dissolved and gaseous species. Onshore and offshore monitoring (Lake Laacher See) were performed to depict spatial behaviour of CO2 natural releases. Additional gaseous species, mainly helium and radon, were also monitored to better assess the shapes of gas vents, using methodologies that were learned from hydrological and tectonic applications. Lake water monitoring allowed the characterisation of the water body itself, in terms of lateral heterogeneities, to evaluate the impact of CO2 deep degassing near the bottom of the lake. The use of a dedicated sensor for monitoring in situ CO2 partial pressure did not provide more valuable information that was learned from more classical physico-chemical parameters. From those investigations, the usefulness of geochemical monitoring is still demonstrated, but the use of complementary approaches and methods is still needed to get a powerful set of techniques able to warn in case of leakages occurring from depth.

This work presents the preliminary design and performance assessment of an innovative type of CAES, based on underwater compressed air energy storage (UW-CAES) volumes and intended for installation in the proximity of deep-water seas or lakes. The UW-CAES works with constant hydrostatic pressure storage and variable volumes. The proposed system is adiabatic, not using any fuel to increase the air temperature before expansion; a sufficient turbine inlet temperature (TIT) is instead obtained through a thermal energy storage (TES) system which recovers the compression heat. The system includes (i) a set of turbomachines (modular multistage compressor, with partial intercooling; expansion turbine); (ii) a TES system with different temperature levels designed to recover a large fraction of the compression heat, allowing the subsequent heating of air prior to the expansion phase; (iii) an underwater modular compressed air storage, conceived as a network of rigid but open tanks lying on the seabed and allowing a variable-volume and constant pressure operation. The compressor operates at variable loads, following an oscillating renewable power input, according to strategies oriented to improve the overall system dispatchability; the expander can be designed to work either at full load, thanks to the stability of the air flowrate and of the TIT guaranteed by the thermal storage, or at variable load. This paper first discusses in detail the sizing and off-design characterization of the overall system; then it simulates a case study where the UW-CAES is coupled to a wind farm for peak shaving and dispatchability enhancement, evaluating the impact of a realistic power input on performances and plant flexibility. Although the assessment shall be considered preliminary, it is shown that round-trip efficiency (RTE) in the range of 75-80% can be obtained depending on the compressor section configuration, making the UW-CAES a promising technology compared to electrochemical and pumped-hydrostorage systems. The technology is also applied to perform peak-shaving of the electricity production from an off-shore wind farm; annual simulations, based on realistic wind data and considering part-load operation, result in global RTE around 75% with a 10-15% reduction in the average unplanned energy injection in the electric grid. The investigated case study provides an example of the potential of this system in providing power output peak shaving when coupled with an intermittent and nonpredictable energy source.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,,,0742-4795,1528-8919,,,,,,,,,,"Politecn Milan, Dept Energy, Via Lambruschini 4A, I-20156 Milan, Italy",,,,2020-09-30,WOS:000570132700001,,

Whilst F-V/F-M in E. huxleyi and C vulgaris was not inhibited by AEO, exposure to two surrogate NAs: (4'-n-butylphenyl)-4-butanoic acid (n-BPBA) and (4'-tert-butylphenyl)-4-butanoic acid (tert-BPBA), caused complete inhibition of F-V/F-M in E. huxleyi (>= 10 mg L-1 n-BPBA; >= 50 mg L-1 tert-BPBA) but not in C vulgaris. Growth rates and cell abundances in E. huxleyi were also reduced when exposed to >= 10 mg L-1 n- and tert-BPBA; however, higher concentrations of n- and tert-BPBA (100 mg L-1) were required to reduce cell growth in C. vulgaris. AEO at >= 10 mg L-1 stimulated E. huxleyi growth rate (p <= 0.002), yet had no apparent effect on C. vulgaris. In conclusion, E. huxleyi was generally more sensitive to NAs than C vulgaris. This report provides a better understanding of the physiological responses of phytoplankton to NAs which will enable improved monitoring of NA pollution in aquatic ecosystems in the future.

These biases result in mis-representation in measurements of true sediment physical properties, and can complicate integration of the composite site records assembled from recovered cores with borehole logs of the stratigraphic section. Here we develop a strategy utilizing gamma ray attenuation (GRA) density to generate mass-specific magnetic susceptibility (MS) and natural gamma radiation (NGR) data. Shipboard GRA density is collected in all cores that comprise a site at equivalent or higher resolution than the corresponding MS and NGR data. All instruments are calibrated assuming a volume of sediment in their detector windows equivalent to that present in a perfectly full core liner; changes in sediment bulk density related to compaction, and/or imperfect sediment recovery resulting in a partially filled core liner thus influence all three measurements proportional to their detector sensitivities. In principle it may be possible to correct MS or NGR data for variable sediment volume by normalizing them to GRA measured at equivalent depth on a sensing track, assuming that the volumetric bias is comparable in all three datasets. Because GRA is measured in much greater detail, it must be smoothed by the known measurement windows of the other parameters for the assumption of comparable analytical sediment volume to be true. Normalizing MS or NGR by the equivalently smoothed GRA in down-hole records should thus remove the bias associated with variable sediment volume in the detector windows, allowing for robust mass-specific determination of these volume-based sediment physical properties.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,0,8,,,0956-540X,1365-246X,,,,,,,,,,"Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 2601, AustraliaOregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USAAustralian Natl Univ, Math Sci Inst, Canberra, ACT 2601, AustraliaColumbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USAUniv Florida, Dept Geol Sci, Gainesville, FL 32603 USAUniv Texas Austin, Inst Geophys, Austin, TX 78758 USATexas A&M Univ, Int Ocean Discovery Program, College Stn, TX 77845 USAUniv Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778564, Japan",,,,2015-09-23,WOS:000360624600046,,

During the accident over 40,000 tons of oil were spilled, and along the next weeks 22,000 more reached the shore in the way of three black tides. A great number of people participated in the cleaning tasks. The objective of this study was to initially evaluate the damage caused by Prestige oil in exposed individuals both from the cytogenetic and the endocrine points of view. Exposure level was determined by analysing volatile organic compounds in the environment and heavy metals in blood. Cytogenctic damage was determined by sister chromatid exchanges (SCE), and plasmatic prolactin and cortisol levels were used as biornarkers of endocrine toxicity. Finally we have determined the possible influence of GST genetic polymorphisms (GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletion polymorphisms, GSTP1 Ala105VaI) on the evaluated effects. The exposed population was classified according to the performed cleaning tasks in three groups: volunteers that collaborated for 1 week (N=25), hired manual workers (N=20) and hired high-pressure cleaner workers (N=23). The control population consisted of 42 individuals. Exposure to Prestige oil caused cytogenetic damage in exposed individuals, being its effect influenced by age, sex, tobacco consumption and GSTM1 polymorphism. With regard to endocrine toxicity, our results showed that xenobiotics present in Prestige oil induced alterations in hormonal status, and thus it may be considered as an endocrine disruptor. Therefore, the selected parameters have shown to be good indicators of toxicity related to exposure to Prestige oil. In addition, data obtained point to the importance of using protective devices in preventing the effects related to the exposure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The J-lay technique has become a better alternative to the conventional S-lay technique for installing subsea pipelines in deep waters. Here the pipeline leaves the vessel in a near vertical position rather than the horizontal position and acquires the J-shape as it reaches the seabed. This method offers several advantages over the conventional S-lay method such as minimal bending and reduced suspended length of pipeline leading to reduced tension and reduced thruster power requirement, precise pipeline positioning and better vessel control. This paper considers a simplified J-lay pipeline numerical modelanalysed using ORCAFLEX. The model consists of 0.6 m diameter steel pipeline being laid at a water depth of 2000 m. Dynamic responses namely effective tension, bending moment and maximum von-Mises stress of the pipeline are studied under the action of waves with and without vessel interaction and under the combined action of waves and currents with vessel interaction. Vessel interaction and presence of currents induces additional stresses in the pipeline being laid and the increase in the maximum values of effective tension, bending moment and maximum von-Mises stress due to the dynamic effects is observed as 36%, 64% and 47.7% respectively.

By strategically focusing High Performance Computing (HPC) and National Capability (NC) on high resolution, global-scale modelling, NERC has placed the UK at the forefront of ocean modelling efforts in Europe. This investment will continue to pay scientific dividends, but NERC is also in an excellent position to extract added value from it by employing it in tackling challenges related to future societal and business needs. In SIRENA, we propose to utilise existing outputs from NERC's NC modelling efforts, as well as existing links through other research programmes, to address two such needs related to the food and energy sectors of modern economies. The first of these relates to so-called marine hotspots, areas where above average climate change may have serious consequences for marine resources, while the second concerns the expanding sphere of oil and gas activities, including to deeper ocean waters. In both of these cases, there are significant trade-offs between the need to extend exploitation while mitigating impacts, and this is compounded by the current and potential overlaps between both cases. In practical terms, SIRENA will develop a case study that demonstrate advances in ocean modelling to potential new user communities, and illustrate the applications of this modelling for environmental risk assessment. The selected case study will focus on a single region (most likely around Brazil) that is both a marine hotspot and is of interest to oil and gas stakeholders, and a further aim is to underscore the overlapping needs and interests, as well as potential collaborations, of these two otherwise divergent activities. To achieve these ends, SIRENA is organised into four workpackages. The first organises an initial workshops with select oil and gas stakeholders to optimise the framing of the case study, which will then be demonstrated at the international Ocean Business exhibition. The second will use existing model output to provide a detailed physical and biogeochemical/ecological forecast for a specific marine hotspot, and will showcase this at the 3rd Symposium on the Effects of Climate Change in Brazil in 2015. The third will leverage an ongoing programme, GULLS, to provide a workshop forum for translating the NERC modelling outputs demonstrated at this symposium (e.g. changing circulation, biogeochemistry) into policy-relevant outputs with the assistance of local stakeholders. The final workpackage will use the experiences derived from the case study to produce a template that will be applied to all of the southern hemisphere marine hotspots that form the basis of the international GULLS programme. The central, driving motivation in SIRENA is that these diverse activities will promote awareness of NERC's world-class modelling efforts and encourage their use in added-value activities by stakeholders that have not traditionally been engaged with NERC centres, but who represent key resource and business interests. In SIRENA's vision, broadening the base of NERC's engagement in this way is critical for such important science to remain viable into the future.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/M00693X/1,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15397264,,

Similarities between Martian geomorphological elements and those of certain terrestrial environments suggest that water processes were involved in the formation of some visible Martian landscapes. Recent advances in three-dimensional seismic reflectivity imaging techniques, drawn mainly from oil and gas exploration activities in deep-water regions of the world, have allowed us to describe a variety of internal stratigraphic architectures that resemble some geomorphological features observed in the circum-Chryse Planitia region of Mars. For example, erosional shadow remnants that have been described as components of deep-water mass transport deposits in the eastern offshore margin of Trinidad closely resemble teardrop-shaped islands that have been described at the downstream end of outflow channels within the circum-Chryse Planitia region.

Results Our field measurements at Hanjiang River Estuary (Guangdong province, China) showed that the carbon stock (46.0 +/- 3.0 Mg/ha) in S. apetala plantations where the native Kandelia obovata formed an understory shrub layer was slightly higher than that in S. apetala monocultures (36.6 +/- 1.3 Mg/ha). Moreover, the carbon stock in monospecific K. obovata stands (106.6 +/- 1.4 Mg/ha) was much larger than that of S. apetala monocultures.

A substantial amount of work has been conducted in the modeling of submarine pipelines laid on the seabed with the awareness of the downsides of such design approach. The high cost and labor intensiveness, due to installation and maintenance, are some of the disadvantages of such design. This paper discusses a new design of suspended pipelines which can be considered a favorable option as opposed to laying oil pipelines on the sea floor. An optimum design of a suspended oil transporting pipeline is considered in this study and a simple nonlinear mathematical model is developed to predict the dynamic behavior of the pipeline. The system consists of buoys as a suspension mechanism, transporting pipeline and vibration absorbers against ocean waves and vortex-shedding excitations. Nonlinearities in the model are due to vortex-shedding effects and fluid damping of the pipeline. The system design parameters considered for optimization are the absorber natural frequency, damping ratio and the buoy diameter. Other system parameters are assumed to be given to avoid design complexity. The design criterion is to minimize vibration amplitude of the pipeline and consequently the internal normal stresses with given constraints of maximum absorber displacement and buoy maximum diameter.",,,,,,,,,2,1,0,0,0,0,3,,,1319-8025,,,,,,,,,,,"King Abdulaziz City Sci & Technol, Natl Robot & Intelligent Syst Ctr, Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaKing Saud Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",,,,2012-10-03,WOS:000308229900016,,

The oil spill from deep waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico is threatening coastal areas in south Florida due to entrainment in the large-scale current system. Assessment of the transport and the fate of the oil require processes extending across oceanic scales and scales relevant to coastal ecosystems to be taken into account simultaneously. To this end, the integrated use of a series of nested ocean and coastal circulation models as a single application is critical in order to be able to identify pathways of the oil mixture from the deeper part of the Gulf of Mexico to the shallow areas of Florida Bay and the Florida coral reef track. Past work in nesting a high-resolution Florida Key model with the Gulf of Mexico real-time Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM)-based Ocean Predictions System using a multi-scale numerical modeling framework, the Connectivity Modeling System (CMS) provides the framework for this study. This modeling framework, originally developed for larval transport and connectivity studies, is well suited for rapid assessment of the impact of the Deepwater Horizon blowout on south Florida coast. The CMS has a hierarchy of embedded Lagrangian Stochastic Particle Models allowing probabilistic dispersion of particles with individual attributes and behaviors and has the capability of tracking the three-dimensional movement of the particles across nested domains. First, the formation of surface slicks, subsurface layers, and deep plumes and their pathways to the Loop Current will be simulated by conducting probabilistic runs of CMS with the highest resolution operational products available yet for the region (i.e., 1-4 km HYCOM-based Ocean Predictions System). In order to do this, we will adapt CMS to oil-gas mixture behavior (i.e., flow rate, density, viscosity, terminal velocity) and add processes of wind forcing, evaporation and weathering. The investigators will use an envelop of oil mixture behavior, varying the size of particles in the model and improve the 'oil module' through systematic comparisons of model results with time series of Eulerian observations. Second, the effect of hurricanes on the redistribution of the oil in the water column will be simulated. Given the large uncertainties inherent in the oil prediction problem, the proposed research will generate statistical estimates of the near-term impact of the oil-dispersant mixture to the South Florida coast. Broader Impacts: This project will provide a new understanding of transport pathways and accumulating areas resulting from the interactions of the circulation with the oil mixed with huge quantities of dispersant. Further, it will help guiding other RAPID efforts on field detection of oil products. In the longer term, the proposed work will constitute a baseline for studying the impact of the oil and its weathered states on the marine meroplankton and on fisheries. Results will also be useful to develop operational efforts in agencies and academia that will help preparedness for any future extreme events. The investigators on this project will collaborate with other scientists working in the Gulf of Mexico. Current website links on the Academic Task Force Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science website (http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/oil-spill) having updates of HYCOM water parcel trajectories will be expanded using the CMS adapted to the oil with its capability to go from the Gulf of Mexico regional model to the high resolution Florida Keys model. Finally, the multi-scale CMS framework is designed to be a community model and has been undergoing rigorous testing. We are planning to use the proposed effort to insure a public release of an open source code and user's guide later in the fall (http:// www.rsmas.miami.edu/personal/cparis/cms/description.html).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1048697,,,,,,,,University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine&Atmospheric Sci,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13712600,,

The produced oil from the ocean bed is transported onshore either by ship or pipeline. This has increased the risk of oil spill in the coastal area. In order to prepare an emergency preparedness plan and to assess the magnitude of risk involved in transporting and offloading oil, oil spill simulation studies play an important role. This paper describes a simulation of oil spill in coastal bay of Arabian Gulf where new developments are taking place using MIKE 21 model. The developments include a diesel based thermal power plant near Sir Baniyas Island, which is an ecological fragile area. Based on the project activity, two probable scenarios, one for diesel leak (250 m(3)/h) for 1 h and the other for instantaneous spill (500 m(3)) are considered. The MIKE 21 model was calibrated for hydrodynamics using measured field data followed by diesel-spill simulation to track its movement in the Arabian Gulf. The results for both leak and instantaneous spill indicate that spilled diesel will not move towards the Sir Banyas Island and more than 45% of the diesel will be evaporated within 48 h of oil spill. Based on the results, a clean up and contingency plan is proposed to mitigate the adverse impacts arising due to diesel spill in the study area.",,,,,,,,,16,3,0,0,7,0,19,,,0167-6369,1573-2959,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Environm Engn Res Inst, Nagpur 440020, Maharashtra, India",,,,2008-11-01,WOS:000260056300017,18095178,

Mountain ecosystems can reduce these threats by providing several positive influences, such as the maintenance of biodiversity, water regulation, and carbon storage, amongst others. The knowledge of the history of these environments and their response to climate change is very important for management, conservation, and environmental monitoring programs. The genesis of the soil organic matter of the current upper montane vegetation remains unclear and seems to be quite variable depending on location. Some upper montane sites in the very extensive coastal Sea Mountain Range present considerable organic matter from the late Pleistocene and other from only the Holocene. Our study was carried out on three soil profiles (two cores in grassland and one in forest) on the Caratuva Peak of the Serra do Ibitiraquire (a sub-range of Sea Mountain Range - Serra do Mar) in Southern Brazil. The delta C-13 isotopic analyses of organic matter in soil horizons were conducted to detect whether C-3 or C-4 plants dominated the past communities. Complementarily, we performed a pollen analysis and C-14 dating of the humin fraction to obtain the age of the studied horizons. Except for a short and probably drier period (between 6000 and 4500 cal yr BP), C-3 plants, including ombrophilous grasses and trees, have dominated the highlands of the Caratuva Peak (Pico Caratuva), as well as the other uppermost summits of the Serra do Ibitiraquire, since around 9000 cal yr BR The Caratuva region represents a landscape of high altitude grasslands (campos de altitude altomontanos or campos altomontanos) and upper montane rain/cloud forests with soils that most likely contain some organic matter from the late Pleistocene, as has been reported in Southern and Southeastern Brazil for other sites. However, our results indicate that the studied deposits (near the summit) are from the early to late Holocene, when somewhat wetter and warmer conditions (since around 9000 cal yr BP) enabled a stronger colonization of the ridge of Pico Caratuva by mainly C-3 plants, especially grassland species. However, at the same time, even near the summit, the soil core from the forest site already presented the current physiognomy (or a shrubby/elfin or successional forest), indicating that the colonization of the neighboring uppermost saddles and valleys were probably populated mainly by upper montane forest species.

J,,,,,,,,,Stephen Mobbs,,Demonstration Of A Comprehensive Approach To Monitoring Emissions From Oil and Gas Installations (AEOG),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2018,2018,"Atmospheric concentrations of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) have increased significantly over the past century due to anthropogenic activity, with the UK offshore oil and gas sector is estimated to produce around 13.2 million tonnes of CO2 and 1.2 million tonnes CO2 equivalent of CH4. Offshore atmospheric emissions reporting are partly industry-led, from the initial permit through to the self-regulatory reporting using EEMS (Environment and Emissions Monitoring System). BEIS (Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy), regards EEMS as a key element in its environmental regulatory function and data within is used for government reporting requirements and policy development and application. Emissions are self-regulated and there is no independent check on how the emissions reported in EEMS relate to the actual emissions. This proposal offers a new methodology whereby the EEMS and initial permitting can be validated using observations from research aircraft.Currently offshore atmospherics permitting and reporting includes the emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, nitrous oxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane and non-methane volatile organic compounds. Energy generation emissions are calculated from measured fuel use using emission factors based on total fuel combustion and / or stack sampling data. Flaring emissions are calculated based on total measured fuel combustion using emission factors. Venting emissions are based on total measured or estimated release volumes. Fugitive emissions are based on estimates relating to any recorded accidental release, and calculated losses based on the number of components and connections (thought to be the primary source of leaks) within an installation and its age. However, the methodology uses an age-related scale factor which becomes applicable when if the installation was built pre-1988. All of these approaches necessarily assume that there is a common set of standard factors, or installations can use their own factor from stack monitoring, that are universally applicable to all offshore oil and gas operating companies and their installations. Direct measurement or monitoring of emissions offshore is limited because of significant logistical, health and safety and cost issues. It is therefore restricted to major combustion sources such as gas turbines. For most sources, emissions are calculated, based on activity data, for example using fuel consumption data or measured flare volumes allied with standard or installation specific emission factors, using measured or estimated venting volumes, or using industry standard estimates for fugitive losses. These methodologies carry a substantial risk that significant emissions may be missed, and any additional monitoring tool is of considerable interest to the industry, the regulator and the body responsible for compiling UK atmospheric emissions data.Techniques developed by NCAS for monitoring gas plumes during the Elgin gas release, have demonstrated that airborne monitoring, coupled with innovative atmospheric modelling, can comprehensively survey large areas and many individual installations within hours (800 nautical miles covered in 4 hours at one altitude). This approach to emissions assessment estimates the total emission loads calculated from the elevation of various gases in the downwind plume. This approach has the potential to provide the regulator, BEIS, with new tools to validate emission levels, and has the potential to provide a monitoring method that is lower cost to the industry then regular stack monitoring surveys and more relevant to impact assessment. The project will work together with BEIS and RICARDO to demonstrate how an airborne methodology can aid existing regulatory approaches, provide data that supports improved emissions estimates and give BEIS the confidence that that operators are reporting sensible and achievable estimates in their permits and EEMS reporting.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/R01454X/1,,,,,,,,University of Leeds,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15402308,,

Localization approaches based on multi-robot systems or complex acoustic infrastructures have been favored in the literature, but alternatively visual modalities are pursued when these options are not feasible. In this work, we present a two-stage navigation scheme that initially generates a coarse probabilistic map of the workspace that is used to refine localization accuracy and filter noise in the second stage. Additionally, an adaptive decision-making approach is introduced that determines which perception cues to incorporate into the localization filter, i.e., tracked 2D features or plane representations, to ensure high accuracy and reduce computation times.

On the interannual and decadal timescales, the ocean-climate change and activity of upwelling in the CCS are principally affected by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, with variable periods ranging from 20 to 30 a). To understand the variation of upwelling activity in the northern region of the CCS since the Early Pleistocene and its main control mechanism, we analyzed the data of calcareous nannofossils (fossils of coccolithophores) and diatom fossils from the International Ocean Drilling Program Holes 1020B (southern site, at 41[degree] N) and 1245B (northern site, at 44[degree] N). Our results suggested that abundance variations in these two fossil groups were correlated with most glacial-interglacial cycles, by which high abundances of diatom fossils and nannofosills were associated with glacial and interglacial stages, respectively. Three ca. 0.5 Ma long-term stages of fossil abundance variations were recognized: the Early Pleistocene Stage (1. 5 - 1. 1 Ma) featured by abundant nannofossils in both holes, the Middle Pleistocene Stage (1.1-0.65 Ma) by relatively abundant diatoms and nannofossils with opposite variation trends in the two holes, and the Late Pleistocene Stage (since 0.65 Ma) by relatively abundant diatoms with very low and sporadic nannofossils in Hole 1245B and contrarily, abundant nannofossils with less abundant diatoms in Hole 1020B. We proposed a mode of long-term dominance of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO-like) in combination with North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO-like) mode to explain the possible mechanisms for these records. The northern region of the CCS had been affected by a long-term dominance of + PDO-like phase that led to decreased upwelling during the Early Pleistocene, and by an altering of - PDO (intensified upwelling) and + PDO phases over the Middle Pleistocene Transition period (MPT). And for the last 0.65 Ma, the region was affected by an altering of strong - NPGO and weak - PDO phases for Hole 1020B, but only by - PDO phase for Hole 1245B. An abrupt increase in diatom abundance (by three times in Hole 1020B and five times in Hole 1245B) marked the setup of MPT at 1.1 Ma, and a significant change in abundances of calcareous nannofossils (3-fold increase and reduction at the southern and northern sites, respectively) indicated the end of MPT at 0.65 Ma. This altering of microfossil abundances was seen as the results of abrupt palaeoceanographic changes. It further implied that the shift from a positive to a negative phase of long-term PDO-like dominance period may be abrupt too. The opposite changing trends of these two fossil groups at the northern and southern sites during and after MPT indicated possible geographical differentiation of ocean-climate conditions in the northern region of the CCS. It provided the Pleistocene records for the study of modern air-ocean processes and biological distribution with the regional boundary at 40[degree] N.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1005-2321,,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Ocean Sci, Beijing, 100083, China",,,,2021-06-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15706038118,,

We apply a total fuel cycleor well-to-propelleranalysis that evaluates emissions along the fuel production and delivery pathway, including feedstock extraction, processing, distribution, and use. We compare emissions profiles for methanol, liquefied natural gas, and low sulfur marine fuel in our analysis, with a focus on exploring tradeoffs across the following pollutants: greenhouse gases, particulate matter, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides. For our greenhouse gas analysis, we apply global warming potentials that consider both near-term (20-year) and long-term (100-year) climate forcing impacts. We also conduct uncertainty analysis to evaluate the impacts of methane leakage within the natural gas recovery, processing, and distribution stages of its fuel cycle. Our results indicate that natural-gas based marine fuels can provide significant local environmental benefits compared to distillate fuel; however, these benefits come with a near-termand possibly long-termglobal warming penalty, unless such natural gas-based fuels are derived from renewable feedstock, such as biomass. These results point to the importance of controlling for methane leaks along the natural gas production process and the important role that renewable natural gas can play in the shipping sector.

Results from two salinity transects along the tidal Waccamaw and Savannah rivers of the U.S. Atlantic Coast show that total C standing stocks were 322-1,264Mg C/ha among all sites, generally shifting to greater soil storage as salinity increased. Carbon mass balance inputs (litterfall, woody growth, herbaceous growth, root growth, and surface accumulation) minus C outputs (surface litter and root decomposition, gaseous C) over a period of up to 11years were 340-900g Cm(-2)year(-1). Soil C burial was variable (7-337g Cm(-2)year(-1)), and lateral C export was estimated as C mass balance minus soil C burial as 267-849g Cm(-2)year(-1). This represents a large amount of C export to support aquatic biogeochemical transformations. Despite reduced C persistence within emergent vegetation, decomposition of organic matter, and higher lateral C export, total C storage increased as forests converted to marsh with salinization. These tidal river wetlands exhibited high N mineralization in salinity-stressed forested sites and considerable P mineralization in low-salinity marshes. Large C standing stocks and rates of C sequestration suggest that TFFW and oligohaline marshes are considerably important globally to coastal C dynamics and in facilitating energy transformations in areas of the world in which they occur.Plain Language Summary Tidal wetlands that occur along the upper reaches of river-associated estuaries are not normally considered when determining the amount of carbon stored, exchanged, or exported from terrestrial ecosystems globally. Examples of these wetland types include tidal freshwater forested wetlands and low-salinity marshes, as well as wetlands at different stages of transition between forest and marsh as salinity intrudes and sea levels rise. However, these tidal wetlands store more carbon than many coastal wetland types documented throughout the world, including classically defined blue carbon wetlands, and they support high rates of annual carbon sequestration (uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere) and lateral carbon export into aquatic environments that can influence critical near-shore and marine energy transformations.",,,,,,,,,79,1,0,0,50,1,88,,,0886-6236,1944-9224,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Lafayette, LA 70506 USAUS Geol Survey, Hydrol Ecol Interact Branch, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 22092 USAClemson Univ, Baruch Inst Coastal Ecol & Forest Sci, Georgetown, SC USAMacquarie Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaUS Geol Survey, Eastern Geol & Paleoclimate Sci Ctr, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 22092 USAAuburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USAAquat Anal & Consulting, Morehead City, NC USANatl Pk Serv, Jean Lafitte Natl Hist Pk & Preserve, New Orleans, LA USA",Aquat Anal & Consulting,,,2018-05-01,WOS:000434413500006,,

Hydrodynamic simulations are carried out for an offshore pipeline to obtain the time history data from which the stress ranges are computed using a rainflow counting algorithm. To model the fatigue damage growth, a Bayesian Network (BN) is established based on a probabilistic solution of Paris' law. Corrosion effects are also incorporated into the network providing a more realistic prediction of the degradation process. To demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology, a case study of a Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) subjected to fatigue cracks and corrosion degradation is studied.

Specifically, the gas industry in Qatar is challenged to minimize the produced/process water (PPW) volumes injected into disposal wells to ensure long term sustainability of the reservoirs. This research evaluated a novel application of forward osmosis (FO) to reduce the volumes of PPW disposed of by deep well injection using brine from thermal desalination plants or seawater as draw solutions. In the case of brines, this process also provides some environmentally beneficial dilution before discharge.In order to verify the PPW volume reduction concept, bench-scale FO experiments were carried out using commercial flat sheet membranes. FO performance was evaluated using PPW with and without pretreatment and results confirm that pretreatment is key to the successful implementation of FO for the treatment of PPW. Experimental results indicate that FO is effective in achieving 50% volume reduction of pretreated PPW with stable flux of 12 LMH.

While corrosion itself is a relatively simple process, the localised manner of corrosion makes in situ assessments difficult. Furthermore, corrosion assessments tend to be measured as part of a forensic investigation. Compounding the issue further is the impact of microbiological/biofilm processes, where corrosion is influenced by the complex processes of different microorganisms performing different electrochemical reactions and secreting proteins and metabolites that can have secondary effects. While traditional microbiological culture-dependent techniques and electrochemical/physical assessments provide some insight into corrosion activity, the identity and role of microbial communities that are related to corrosion and corrosion inhibition in different materials and in different environments are scarce. One avenue to explore MIC and MIC inhibition is through the application of omics-based techniques, where insight into the bacterial population in terms of diversification and their metabolism can be further understood.

The questionnaire contained scales measuring work pressure and work clarity, job communication, safety behaviour, risk perception, satisfaction with safety measures and safety attitudes. A total of 722 UK offshore workers (33% response rate) from a range of occupations completed and returned the questionnaire. The 'safety climates' on the various installations were characterized by most respondents feeling 'safe' with respect to a range of offshore hazards and expressing 'satisfaction' with safety measures. Respondents reported little risk-taking behaviour and felt positive about levels of work clarity and job communication. There was a wider diversity of opinions on the safety attitudes scale, indicating a lack of a positive, concerted 'safety culture' and more evidence for a range of fragmented 'safety subcultures', which varied mainly as a function of seniority, occupation, age, shift worked and prior accident involvement. It is suggested that the interaction between these differing subcultures partly determines the prevailing 'safety climate' on any given installation. The UK oil and gas industry is now trying to improve its safety culture through the 'Step-Change' initiative, which has set itself three main targets for the year 2000: a 50 % improvement in the industry's safety performance; safety performance contracts demonstrating leadership's personal concern for safety as an equal to business performance and encouraging industry members to work together to improve sharing of safety information and good practice.

Some of the claims can be tested, but many cannot be or are impacted to a significant degree by unobservable variables, and the assessment is limited by the availability of data and factor analysis. The effects of oil prices on rig demand are examined and the relationship between dayrates and oil prices, utilisation rates, rig specifications, contract length, ownership, contractor size, and well type are evaluated over the period 2000-2010 for selected time horizons, rig classes, and geographic regions. Oil prices explain a large proportion of the variation in the number of active rigs and average dayrates, while utilisation is a weaker predictor of dayrates with effects varying by region and time period. There is no evidence that large contractors are able to use their market power to capture higher dayrates than would be expected by their fleet specification.

Regional uplift should cause dissociation of gas hydrates stored in marine sedimentary strata, and the subsequent release of carbon to the atmosphere should enhance warming through the greenhouse effect. We have developed models of the spatial distribution of uplift to match observational constraints from sedimentary basins fringing the North Atlantic. In order to provide quantitative estimates of the carbon released upon uplift, these models are coupled to a simple parameterisation of carbon storage in sub-seafloor gas hydrates. Results of modelling indicate that large quantities of carbon can be released by uplift, with some models generating over 2000Gt of carbon release. The possibility that latest Paleocene regional uplift occurred over the same time interval as onset of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, around 30kyr) cannot be ruled out using current stratigraphical observations or mantle convection models. In this case, the uplift mechanism alone can account for the magnitude and timing of the carbon isotope excursion associated with the PETM. Alternatively, if the duration of latest Paleocene uplift was closer to the upper bound of around 1 Myr or if other Paleocene uplift events were equally significant, then gas hydrate dissociation upon uplift could have contributed to longer-term changes in ocean temperature and carbon isotope composition through the late Paleocene. These temperature changes, in combination with development of the North Atlantic land bridge during the latest Paleocene culmination of uplift, may be able to force rapid changes in ocean circulation and cause phenomena such as the PETM.

Different methods of classifying organismal features into characters and character states (CCSs) can dramatically affect the results of phylogenetic analyses. Here, I show that, in the framework of Markov models, the modular structure of the gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying trait development, and the hierarchical nature of GRN evolution, essentially remove the distinction between morphological CCS, thus endowing the CCS with an invariant property with respect to each other. This property allows the states of one character to be represented as several individual characters and vice versa. In practice, this means that a phenotype can be encoded using a set of characters or just one complex character with numerous states. The representation of a phenotype using one complex character can be implemented in Markov models of trait evolution by properly structuring transition rate matrix.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,5,0,7,,,1063-5157,1076-836X,,,,,,,,,,"Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Pohjoinen Rautatiekatu 13, FI-00014 Helsinki, FinlandVirginia Tech, Dept Biol Sci, 4076 Derling Hall,926 West Campus Dr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USAUniv Tennessee, Natl Inst Math & Biol Synth, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",Finnish Museum Nat Hist,,,2020-04-14,WOS:000522858100013,31372653,

The proposed design criterion considers the Ultimate Limit State (ULS) for the tendon sections, expressed in terms of the expected value of the extreme Interaction Ratio (IR), considering long-term storm sea states, and takes into account the dynamic load effects interaction and the statistics of its associated extreme response. The partial safety factors are calibrated through a long-term reliability-based methodology for the storm environmental conditions in deep waters of the Campeche Bay, Mexico. Different target reliability values are considered in order to evaluate the effect of this key parameter on safety factors. The results show that the partial safety factors reflect both the uncertainty content and the importance of the random variables in structural reliability analysis. When tendons are designed according to the developed LRFD criterion, a less scattered variation of reliability indexes is obtained for different tendon sections across a single or a variety of TLP designs, Finally, it is observed that the target reliability value has a strong influence over the safety factor values and thus over the final size of the structural elements.

SCRs have been installed and in service in offshore oil and gas industries in the Gulf of Mexico, Campos Basin, Brazil and West of Africa since the 1990s. The platforms designed for SCRs range from semi-submersible, Spar, TLP to FPSO.Severe motions of a floating host facility Such as a TLP, FPSO or other platform may have implications for the strength and fatigue life of SCR. To better understand the effect of floater motion on deepwater SCR, a comparison study of such effect was conducted. Three typical floaters Including semi-submersible, Spar and TLP were selected for comparison purpose. An identical SCR was assumed for all floaters in order to make comparison on the same basis. Study focus was given to the strength and motion fatigue analysis.To illustrate the floater effect on SCR performance, an example was given for an 8.625 inches diameter SCR. Detail finite element analysis were performed by use of ABAQUS. It was found that the floater motion has significant impact on SCR's both strength and fatigue. Among the selected floaters, it was found that semi-submersible and Spar are much more friendly to SCR, while TLP makes SCR design more challenging. In addition, the effect of different floater concept on SCR global configuration design was also discussed. Meanwhile, the analysis technique was also discussed through this study.

Such a design criterion might bring issues not foreseen in the original design when future assets are to be installed in close proximity for example pipeline crossings, hot-tap tie-ins or parallel lines using the same corridor. Although not limited to any particular region of the globe, this issue has been showing increasing relevance in the Australian North West Shelf over the last few years. The combination of environmental and geotechnical conditions in that region has led to significant advances in engineering design techniques, and to audacious projects which made viable a number of important subsea pipelines which have been designed to be dynamically stable. As this oil and gas province matures, the installed infrastructure in the region forms part of an increasingly complex subsea network.The design of new subsea assets close to, crossing, or tying into these dynamically stable pipelines require the reassessment of the existing infrastructure for potential clashing conditions. This paper discusses the techniques and integrity criteria available for reassessing dynamically stable pipelines whose originally expected displacements may be incompatible with new required infrastructure.

The problem has been traditionally tackled by using oil-based drilling mud. However, this technique is costly and restricted by the environmental regulatory bodies. Recent studies have shown that borehole instability in shales can be managed by controlling the chemical potential of drilling mud. One of the critical issues in this approach is that shales are not ideal membranes. It is essential to understand the nonideal behavior of shale before the wellbore instability problem can be managed by the chemical potential approach.The nonideality of a shale membrane is, in general, a function of the type of the shale being drilled, composition of the formation water in the shale, burial depth of the shale, and chemical composition of the drilling mud used. In this paper, the theory on nonideal membrane was reviewed and identified for the purpose. The mathematical model was validated by experimental results obtained using a real field shale specimen from the Northwest Shelf of Australia.

Multibeam bathymetric mapping surveys over the entire channel complex in the lower 80 km of the distributary channel, and over 12- to 24-h tidal periods at six transect locations in the reach are used to characterize bottom type and change on seasonal and tidal timescales, supplemented by bottom sampling. The results of this study indicate that the largest proportion of channel floor (up to 80% of the total area) is composed of substratum outcrops of relict sediment units deposited during the progradation of the delta in the last 3.5 ka. These take the form of outcrops that are either (1) steep-sided, tabular channel floor, (2) steep-sided sidewall, or (3) relatively flat channel floor. Flatter outcrops of channel floor substratum are identified by the presence of sedimentary furrows (< 0.5 m deep) incised into the channel bottom that are exposed at high discharge and oriented along channel and laterally continuous for kilometers. These furrows are persistent in location and extent across tidal cycles and appear to be incised into relict units, sometimes with a thin surficial layer of modern sediment observable in bottom grabs. The extent of substratum exposure, greater than that observed previously in low tidal energy systems like the Mississippi River, may relate both to a relatively low sand supply from the catchment, and/or to an efficient transfer of both sand and mud through this tidally energetic channel. Sand bottom areas forming dunes, comprise about 19% of the channel floor over the study area and are generally less than a few meters thick except on bar extensions of mid channel islands. Both sandy and substratum areas are mantled by soft muds 0.25-1 m thick during low discharge in the estuarine section of the study area. This mud mantling appears to be a key control on bottom sourcing of sand to suspension.

The chemical analytical data and model results indicated that A. marina had profound and predictable effects on the distribution, degradation and preservation of oil and that the net effect depended on the initial distribution of oil. In sediment with an oil contaminated subsurface-layer A. marina buried the layer deeper in the sediment which clearly enhanced oil persistence. Conversely. A. marina stimulated both the physical removal and microbial degradation of oil compounds in uniformly oil contaminated sediments especially in deeper sediment layers (10-20 cm below the surface), whereas the fate of oil compounds deposited in surface layers (0-5 cm) mainly was affected by removal processes induced by wave actions and other bioturbating infauna such as Nereis diversicolor, Corophium volutator and Hydrobia spp. present in the experimental plots.

Government has already been working on solar energy and biogas so that they become popular. In this paper, we present tidal energy of Bangladesh as another potent and promising source of renewable energy. Encompassed by the Bay of Bengal to the south, this country has considerable scope to develop tidal power. Here in this paper we show tidal data of 6 different sites of Bangladesh to propose that Bangladesh has real potential of using tidal sources for power generation which should be properly utilized.

The lengthy environmental compliance process, estimated to incur a 7-10 year permitting timeline [1], has been identified as a significant impediment to offshore energy development in U.S. waters. During operation, seabirds can collide and be displaced by turbines. During episodic pre-operation phases, cetaceans are most heavily impacted acoustically by pile driving (and similarly seismic air gun surveys for oil and gas exploration). The varying nature of impacts in space and time leads us to conclude that sites should be selected in space to minimize long-term operational impacts on seabirds, and timing of surveying and construction activities to be conducted in times of the year when sensitive migratory marine mammals are least present. We developed a novel spatiotemporal decision support framework that interactively visualizes tradeoffs between OWED industry profits and wildlife sensitivities, in both space and time. The framework highlights sites on a map that are the most profitable and least sensitive to seabirds. Within the U.S. Mid-Atlantic study area, the New York Call Areas are particularly well optimized for minimal impact on seabirds with maximal profits to OWED. For a given site, pre-operational activities (e.g. pile driving and seismic air gun surveying) are advised by cetacean sensitivity across months of the year that minimize impacts on migratory cetaceans, particularly those of highest conservation concern such as the North Atlantic right whale ( Eubalaena Glacialis ). For instance, within optimal sites for the New York Call Area the least impacting months are May and June. Other taxa are certainly affected by OWED and should be incorporated into this framework, but data on their distributions and/or sensitivities is currently less well known. Built with open-source software made publicly available, the authors hope this framework will be extended even more comprehensively into the future as our knowledge on species distributions and OWED sensitivities expands for streamlining environmental compliance.

J,,,,,,,,,Bahman Tohidi,,"Capillary controls on gas hydrate growth and dissociation in synthetic and natural porous media: PVT, NMR, Neutron Diffraction and SANS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Feb 01 2006,2006,"Gas hydrates are ice-like solids which form from water and gas molecules at low temperature and high pressure conditions. Within the hydrate structure, water molecules form a network cage-like cavities of varying size within which gas molecules are trapped in a compressed form.In the 1970's it was recognised that very large quantities of methane gas hydrate occur naturally in sediments of the subsea continental slopes and the subsurface of Arctic permafrost regions. Since this discovery, global interest in methane hydrates has grown steadily, with research expanding particularly rapidly over the past decade. Important issues driving research include the potential for methane hydrates as an energy resource, the possibilities for CO2 disposal as gas hydrates beneath the seafloor, increasing awareness of the relationship between seafloor hydrate destablisation and large subsea landslides, the potential hazard hydrate destabilisation could pose to deepwater oil/gas platforms, pipelines and subsea cables, and long-term considerations with respect to hydrate stability, methane (a potent greenhouse gas) release to the atmosphere, and global climate changes.In the past, models for the formation and distribution of gas hydrates in marine sediments generally assumed that laboratory measurements on bulk (no sediments present) water-gas systems could be directly applied to the natural environment. Ocean floor drilling has confirmed that the Base of Hydrate Stability Zone (BHSZ) in seafloor sediments commonly lies close to pressure and temperature conditions calculated from bulk laboratory hydrate measurements, however there are a number of sites where the thickness of the Hydrate Stability Zone (HSZ) is much less than predicted, suggesting that host sediments are somehow acting to inhibit hydrate growth and/or stability.The mechanisms by which sediments may alter hydrate stability are still poorly understood. Variations in gas composition (e.g. the addition of CO2) can promote hydrate stability, while saline pore waters will act to inhibit hydrates. However, where gas and pore water salt concentrations are reasonably well established, alternative mechanisms of inhibition must be considered when predicted and actual BHSZs do not agree. One factor that could potentially alter the stability of gas hydrates and influence their distribution within sediments is pore size and geometry.It is well-established that, when confined to narrow pores, fluids can be subject to very high internal (capillary) pressures. High capillary pressures can result in changes in the temperature/pressure conditions where phase transitions such as liquid freezing and melting take place. As sediments which host gas hydrates are commonly characterised by fine-grained silts, muds and clays, often with quite narrow mean pore diameters, capillary inhibition has previously been proposed as a mechanism to explain the observed differences between predicted and actual hydrate stability zones. The aim of this work is to examine the relationship between pore size, geometry, capillary pressures and gas hydrate growth and dissociation conditions in synthetic and natural sediments, and to assess the extent to which capillary inhibition is a factor in seafloor/permafrost hydrate systems.A variety of experimental approaches will be used to investigate capillary effects on hydrate growth from the micro (pore) to macro (core scales). Novel synthetic pore micromodels will be used to visually study hydrate crystal growth patterns at the pore scale, complimenting and supporting large volume, long-duration, pressure-volume-temperature-composition measurements on sediment cores, while Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) will be used to probe fluid states (hydrate, water, gas) and distribution within pores. Experimental data will be combined to develop a model capable of predicting hydrate growth and dissociation conditions as a function of sediment pore size distribution.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/D052556/1,,,,,,,,Heriot-Watt University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15374846,,

In spite of these facts, quantitative risk analyses of offshore oil and gas production platforms have focused on technical safety systems. This paper presents a method (called BORA-Release) for qualitative and quantitative risk analysis of the platform specific hydrocarbon release frequency. By using BORA-Release it is possible to analyse the effect of safety barriers introduced to prevent hydrocarbon releases, and how platform specific conditions of technical, human, operational, and organisational risk influencing factors influence the barrier performance. BORA-Release comprises the following main steps: (1) development of a basic risk model including release scenarios, (2) modelling the performance of safety barriers, (3) assignment of industry average probabilities/frequencies and risk quantification based on these probabilities/frequencies, (4) development of risk influence diagrams, (5) scoring of risk influencing factors, (6) weighting of risk influencing factors, (7) adjustment of industry average probabilities/frequencies, and (8) recalculation of the risk in order to determine the platform specific risk related to hydrocarbon release. The various steps in BORA-Release are presented and discussed. Part 11 of the paper presents results from a case study where BORA-Release is applied. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluated the performance of the biggest AWL-reactor to date that was installed at a coal-fired power plant in Germany. Depending on the gas flow rate, approximately 55% of the CO2 could be removed from the flue gas. The generated product water was characterized by an up to 5-fold increase in alkalinity, which indicates the successful weathering of limestone and the long-term storage of the captured CO2. A rise of potentially harmful substances in the product water (NO2-, NOx-, NH4+, SO42-, and heavy metals) or in unreacted limestone particles (heavy metals) to levels of environmental concern could not be observed, most likely as a result of a desulfurization of the flue gas before it entered the AWL reactor.

High-molecular-weight PAHs (HPAHs) dominated in the rainy season. The ecological risk of PAHs in the sediment was low, whereas the total health risk through ingestion and dermal contact was considerably high. The SOM (self-organizing map) analysis clustered the datasets of PAH-contaminated sediment into five groups with similar concentration levels. Factor analysis identified major factors, namely coal combustion, traffic, petrogenic, and petrochemical industry factors, accounting for 88.67% of the variance in the original datasets. The major tributary and the downstream of the river were identified as PAH-contamination hotspots. The PMF (positive matrix factorization) was combined with toxicity assessment to estimate the possible apportionment of sources and the associated toxicity. Spills of petroleum-related products, vehicle exhaust, coal combustion, and exhaust from a petrochemical industry complex constituted respectively 12%, 6%, 74%, and 86% of PAHs in the sediment, but contributed respectively 7%, 15%, 22%, and 56% of toxicity posed by PAHs in the sediment. To improve the sediment quality, best management practices should be adopted to eliminate nonpoint sources of PAHs flushed by storm water into the major tributary and the downstream of the Erjen River. The proposed methodologies and results provide useful information on remediating river PAH-contaminated sediment and may be applicable to other basins with similar properties that are experiencing resembled river environmental issues.

To prevent and eradicate this problem, it is extremely urgent to monitor the long-term desertification process and assess the relative roles of its drivers. Based on an analytical hierarchy process, in this research, the spatiotemporal features of the desertification process were surveyed from 1982 to 2012 using four indicators. Further analysis was focused on determining the relative importance of multiple driving factors causing desertification in different ecosystems. The results revealed significant desertification expansion in the western part of Central Asia, with the most severe desertification occurring in eastern Xinjiang Province and the Ustyurt Plateau, with mean desertification indexes (DIs) as high as 0.8. According to a change-year analysis, mutation years of desertification were observed from 1993 to 2002 for most vegetation types. The desertification process for different vegetation types results from different major driving factors. Climatic factors, including decreased precipitation, increased temperature and drought, were the main drivers of desertification, especially for grasslands, forests and sparse vegetation. The desertification process of sparse vegetation and croplands was expanded and triggered by human activities: oil and gas exploration in the southern Ustyurt Plateau and agricultural abandonment in northern Kazakhstan. The results also indicated that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, rangeland abandonment in eastern Kazakhstan triggered desertification reversion in grasslands. Furthermore, due to inefficient irrigation water use, severe salt accumulation in croplands of the Amu Darya River delta resulted in desertification expansion in this region. In Central Asia, the desertification process in forests and areas of sparse vegetation was extremely sensitive to climatic variations, while that in croplands and grasslands was vulnerable to human activities. Therefore, regional governments should strive to reverse desertification to protect and improve this fragile, arid ecological environment.",,,,,,,,,80,10,0,0,28,0,86,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R ChinaUniv Ghent, Dept Geog, B-9000 Ghent, BelgiumSino Belgian Joint Lab Geoinformat, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R ChinaSino Belgian Joint Lab Geoinformat, B-9000 Ghent, BelgiumCAS Res Ctr Ecol & Environm Cent Asia, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China",Sino Belgian Joint Lab GeoinformatCAS Res Ctr Ecol & Environm Cent Asia,,,2019-06-20,WOS:000470966000020,,

The riser in this model is regarded as a simply supported beam located in the vertical plane and is subjected to axial and lateral ocean environment loadings. The model is solved using the finite element method. The validity of the analysis model has been proved by a similar experiment conducted in a deep water basin and ANSYS. Riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection of the deep water well considering actual riser string configuration in South China Sea are. simulated. The effects of top tension, drilling platform drift distance, surface current speed, wave height, wave period, wave length, wind speed and damping coefficient on riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection are also discussed. Results indicate that riser string configuration has a significant effect on riser mechanical behavior, particularly in the distribution of bending moment. Riser string configuration designing according to concrete ocean environment can significantly improve the riser's mechanical behavior. The distribution of riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection increases with the increase in surface current speed and drilling platform drift distance, whereas decreases with the increasing top tension and damping coefficient. The distribution of riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection significantly increases with the increase in surface current speed and large current speed may lead to large lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection. Increasing top tension can significantly decrease riser mechanical behavior parameters and avoid large lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection when suffering extreme ocean environment conditions in deepwater drilling field. Drilling platform should avoid a large drift distance, which may result in the deflection over the flex joint working range and the enlargement of the riser bend moment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

All main engines were dual fuel operated with Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) or Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). Alternative onshore and offshore fuel supply chains were considered. Primary energy use and greenhouse gas emissions were assessed. Raw material extraction was found to be the most impactful life cycle stage (similar to 90% of total energy use). Regarding greenhouse gases, liquefaction was the key issue. When transitioning from HFO to LNG, the systems were mainly influenced by a reduction in cargo capacity due to bunkering requirements and methane slip, which depends on the fuel supply chain (onshore has 64% more slip than offshore) and the engine type (4-stroke engines have 20% more slip than 2-stroke engines).

In the Exploration and Production industry, environmental concerns have made effective management of drilling waste at well sites a great priority. Effective waste management is thus a key element in a successful drilling project. The industry therefore relies on effective expertise and newer technologies to maintain a balanced trade-off between healthy business activities and environmental effects. Over several decades, the industry has recorded remarkable progress in reducing the effects of drilling activities on the environment. The progressive development and adoption of sustainable drilling waste management protocols by operating and servicing companies have been partly responsible for this success. However, new challenges are emerging due to advances in drilling techniques such as extended reach wells, deep water drilling, multi-lateral drilling, and high-pressure wells. Recently, advanced drill waste treatment methods such as nanotechnology based approach, supercritical fluid extraction, and microwave treatment process have been explored and tested in the laboratory and on pilot scale to see if they can help overcome these challenges and increasingly stringent regulations. This paper reviews the shortcomings of the conventional approaches, their treatment technologies, advantages, and applications. This article enhances understanding of waste management and its treatment process based on sustainability concept. Researchers can find this review useful as an update on the state of drill waste management in the oil and gas industry. It can also serve as a useful guide to develop new rigorous sustainable models, protocols, and techniques to manage drilling waste using the noble concept.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,0,11,,,1582-9596,1843-3707,,,,,,,,,,"King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dept Petr Engn, POB 2020, Dhahran 31261, Saudi ArabiaKing Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Res Inst, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia",,,,2017-11-28,WOS:000415722600003,,

However, hazardous and poisonous contaminants in the mud could not be discharged with conventional disposals and treatments, which are of low economic efficiency and negative environmental. Therefore, alternative treatment technologies such as supercritical carbon dioxide extraction (SCE) are being of more and more concern in drilling operations. In this paper, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry (UV-VIS) are applied to examine the contents of different contaminants in the oil based mud from the North China Sea, which indicates that the hydrocarbon concentrations significantly exceed the normal value while the heavy metals are negligible. SCE experiments are then conducted to extract hydrocarbons from the mud to evaluate effects of various SCE operation parameters including extraction pressure (10-30 MPa), temperature (20-65 degrees C), extraction time (20-150 min) and the mass ratio of supercritical carbon dioxide to waste OBM (1-12). The results demonstrate that extraction efficiency could be up to 98% under the temperature of 35 degrees C, the pressure of 20 MPa and the extraction time of 60 min. In addition, gas chromatography is performed, finding that SCE can discharge all hydrocarbon components from C-10 to C-26, with lighter carbon components of C-10 to C-14 and n-alkanes (NC) structure hydrocarbons have more removability under experimental condition.

Although the amount of habitat lost directly to energy development in the Arctic will likely be relatively small, there are significant concerns about habitat that may be indirectly affected because of caribou avoidance behaviors. Behavioral responses to energy development for wildlife have been documented, but such responses are often assumed to dissipate over time, despite scant information on the ability of animals to habituate. To understand the long-term effects of energy development on barren-ground caribou, we investigated the behavior of the Central Arctic Herd in northern Alaska, which has been exposed to oil development on its summer range for approximately 40 years. Using recent (2015-2017) location data from global positioning system (GPS)-collared females, we conducted a zone of influence analysis to assess whether caribou reduced their use of habitat near energy development, and if so, the distance the effects attenuated. We conducted this analysis for the calving, post-calving, and mosquito harassment periods when caribou exhibit distinct resource selection patterns, and contrasted our results to past research that investigated the responses of the Central Arctic Herd immediately following the construction of the oil fields. Despite the long-term presence of energy development within the Central Arctic Herd summer range, we found that female caribou exhibited avoidance responses to infrastructure during all time periods, although the effects waned across the summer. Caribou reduced their use of habitat within 5 km of development during the calving period, within 2 km during the post-calving period, and within 1 km during the mosquito harassment period; these areas were predicted to overlap 12%, 15%, and 17% of important calving, post-calving, and mosquito period habitat, respectively. During the calving period, the indirect effects we observed were similar to those observed in past research, whereas during the post-calving and mosquito periods, we detected avoidance responses that had not been previously reported. These findings corroborate a growing body of evidence suggesting that habituation to industrial development in caribou in the Arctic is likely to be weak or absent, and emphasizes the value of minimizing the footprint of infrastructure within important seasonal habitat to reduce behavioral effects to barren-ground caribou.

Resilience is a term that has been used to describe an organization's ability to respond or 'bounce back' from untoward, surprising or disruptive events. A growing number of organizations have increased mandates for maintaining safety, reliability and resilience; some of these are also virtual or semi virtual organizations-geographically distributed organizations whose members are bound by a long-term common interest or goal, and who largely communicate and coordinate their work through information technology. The objective of this paper is to explicate the challenges that reliability-seeking virtual organizations (RSVOs) pose for high reliability and resilient organizations, based on what is known about high reliability organizations (HROs) and resilient organizations, and what can be surmised about RSVOs. We begin by exploring a test case for RSVOs, distributed offshore oil and gas systems, using the example of the challenges presented during the Deepwater Horizon event. Since a common characteristic of resilient and reliable organizations is fluidity in organizational structures, we examine requirements for fluidity in and across RSVO organizational structures and the forms that fluidity can assume, leaning on our understanding of the role of fluidity in HROs and resilient organizations, and suggesting challenges posed by these different forms of interconnectedness. We then follow with a discussion of when a virtual organization is not highly reliable or resilient. We describe future RSVO challenges in remote settings with little infrastructure, such as Arctic energy exploration and development and IT-enabled healthcare systems in third world countries, and conclude with an agenda for future research.

We performed simulations of virtual oil spills using realistic atmospheric and oceanic conditions. The resulting maps show dominance of the alongshore northerly current, which causes the high probability areas to be stretched parallel to the coast, increasing contamination probability downstream of source points. The seasonal westerly wind forcing determines how wide the high probability areas are, and may also restrict these to a small coastal region near source points. Seasonal variability in probability distribution, oil state, and pollution time is also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Much is being done to avert this crisis including more efficient technology for usage, savings and replacing carbon fuels with alternatives whenever feasible. The capture of CO2 followed by sequestration (CCS) into geologic formation or under the seas has also been proposed and in some cases implemented. Carbon capture and recycling (CCR) to fuels and materials is another promising approach. At first, capturing carbon dioxide from concentrated sources such as fossil fuel burning power plants, industrial plants and natural sources might be the most practical. However, the capture of CO2 from the atmosphere is also technically feasible despite its low concentration (similar to 390 ppm) and presents even some benefits compared to point source CO2 capture. The present article reviews methods developed for the capture of CO2 directly from the air as well as their advantages and drawbacks. While strong bases such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide could be used, their regeneration is energy intensive, requiring high temperatures. Amines either physically or chemically immobilized on solid supports require much lower temperatures for their regeneration and are therefore promising candidates.",,,,,,,,,492,15,1,0,57,1,538,,,1754-5692,1754-5706,,,,,,,,,,"Univ So Calif, Loker Hydrocarbon Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USAUniv So Calif, Dept Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",,,,2012-07-01,WOS:000305530900016,,

This spatial non-conservative behavior of metals is presumably due to the: 1. mixing between polluted river-borne particles and material of drainage basin and coastal origin; 2. changes of the distribution coefficient of metals between the particulate and solution phases (K-d) with variations of salinity, pH and SPM concentrations; and 3. physical settling and currents, Short-term, tidal cycle measurements undertaken at the lower Kishon system (Julius Simon Bridge) indicated a high contribution of resuspended sediments to the SPM amounts due to the high tidal energy, It is hypothesized that the latter is the main mechanism by which SPM, which settles in the estuary, is transported landward creating a turbidity maximum zone between the Julius Simon and Histadrut bridges, i.e. about 3 km upstream from the estuary, It is proposed that the upper estuary zone acts as a purging system through which a low flux of SPM, enriched by organic and trace metal content, is transported seaward and from which a high flux of SPM is returned landward due to tidal stress.

Researchers have identified OMA formation as a natural method of oil dispersion, and have sought ways to enhance this process for oil spill remediation. Currently there is a lack of understanding of how the weathering of oil will affect the formation of OMA due to a lack of published data on this relationship. Based on literature, we identified two conflicting hypotheses: OMA formation 1) increases with weathering as a result of increased asphaltene and polar compound content; or 2) decreases with weathering as a result of increased viscosity. While it is indeed true that the viscosity and the relative amount of polar compounds will increase with weathering, their net effects on OMA formation is unclear. Controlled laboratory experiments were carried out to systematically test these two conflicting hypotheses. Experimental results using light, intermediate, and heavy crude oils, each at five weathering stages, show a decrease in OMA formation as oil weathers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Because higher rates of water flow decrease the distance over which nutrients must diffuse to the roots, down-slope vegetation is more productive under current conditions. In response to elevated CO2 and a warmer, wetter climate, the relative increase in carbon stored in vegetation and soils was higher uphill, but the absolute increase was higher downhill. Very little of the increase in carbon anywhere on the hill slope resulted from an increase in total ecosystem nitrogen. Instead, the increases were associated with increases in vegetation C: N ratio (woodiness) and with the redistribution of nitrogen from soils ( low C: N) to vegetation ( high C: N).

I examine the central role played by the 'great canoes' of the ancestors in Pacific literature, especially as the canoe is identified with the mauri or 'spirit of the land' in two well-known novels, The Whale Rider by Witi Ihimaera and The Bone People by Keri Hulme. The representations of incest, violence against very young women and sexual possession linked to the site of a canoe stone in the first Kanak novel, L'Epave, however, open up a troubling and critical space within such apparently idealizing images. Dewe Gorode's text makes explicit the extent to which the locations of the (wrecked) forms of the canoe are shifting - at once ancestral, imposed by colonialism and commodified by a global capitalist society. The canoe itself is a hybrid. Hybridity in Gorode's texts derives not only from a century and a half of co-existence with a socio-politically dominant white New Caledonian society but also from a sense of 'wreckage' present behind the surfaces of custom in whose survival and renewal the writer is nonetheless deeply emotionally and politically invested. Through the metonymy of the canoe - rock as wreck - I argue, Gorode's work connects with other Pacific writing exploring violence and more generally, hybridity. Paradoxically, there is transnationality concealed within the very insularity and cultural-centredness of this single published Kanak novelist. Unspoken questions of the pleasure of the 'feminine' body, its power, and, more particularly, the modes of its exploitation, create connections and migrations across indigenous Pacific communities and between literary texts. In all of these texts, the fluidity and mediation of the sea-voyaging canoe remains a contradictory but not mutually exclusive avatar of the stone, buried deeply in the earth. The voyage into the belly of the canoe is emblematic of the search for both 'roots' and 'routes', a locus of hybridity seeking to create new 'third' spaces where women have a different place.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1368-2679,1758-9142,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Auckland, French, Auckland, New Zealand",,,,2008-12-01,WOS:000212889100005,,

JOHN'S,,OCEANS-IEEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Proceedings Paper,2014,2014,"Oil and gas operations have moved from conventional petroleum reserves to unconventional petroleum reserves such as remote offshore, deep Ocean and the Arctic. The management of oil spills is especially challenging due to these conditions. Oil spills are typically due to vessels accidents, tanker discharges, wells, offshore platforms, drilling wastes, or release of refined petroleum products and their by-products, heavier fuels and the spill of any waste oil. Oil spills impact human, plants and wild life including birds, fish and mammals, and therefore the response strategies must attempt to minimize the impact to multiple receptors. In Arctic environments, traditional mitigation and response to oil spill are less effective due to low water/air temperatures, ice cover, and other environmental conditions. Dispersants are a common response method; however there are issues with respect to toxicity and effectiveness of chemically derived dispersants. Biologically derived surfactants and dispersants, produced by naturally occurring bacteria, have some advantages including rapid biodegradation and low toxicity over the synthetic surfactants. However, large scale production is limited because of high costs associated with growth medium and operations. Cost effective production of biosurfactants could be achieved by using industrial wastes and by-products as media/substrate, thereby decreasing expensive medium costs and reducing the environmental impacts of the wastes. In this study the feasibility of glycerol, derived from the conversion of waste fish oil to biodiesel, as an effective carbon source for the production of biodispersants by indigenous Rhodococcus erythropolis and Bacillus subtilis strain is investigatedGlycerol, a tribasic alcohol, is a byproduct of the biodiesel production process. Biodiesel is produced via the transesterification reaction of triglycerides in oils or fats and waste oils, with alcohols, in the presence of a homogeneous catalyst (chemical or enzymatic). In general, for every 10 kg of biodiesel produced approximately 1 kg of crude glycerol. As the production of biodiesel increases so will crude glycerol. The glycerol market is a saturated market already, and therefore any alternative market for this byproduct is advantageous to the larger scale production of biodiesel production. The waste stream ability to produce biosurfactant by indigenous Bacillus subtilis and Rhodococcus erythropolis strains will be determined. The cultivations will be performed in 250 mL flasks containing 50 ml medium at room temperature, and stirred in a rotary shaker at 30 C and 200 rpm for 3-4 days. Biosurfactant productivity will be evaluated by surface tension measurement and emulsification index (E24) determination as response variables.

Constraints are emerging in terms of land and water resources as well as imperatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There is evidence that rates of increase in agricultural productivity are reducing, both in Australia and overseas. On top of all these drivers of change, agriculture is the sector probably most exposed to climate change, and Australian agriculture is as exposed as any in the world.Against this turbulent background, this paper explores some of the emerging opportunities and challenges in Australian agriculture. These include new products or services from agriculture such as biofuels, forest-based carbon storage in agricultural landscapes, bio-sequestration of carbon in agricultural soils, and environmental stewardship schemes that would reward farmers for nature conservation and related non-production services from farming land. Although there are situations where all these emerging opportunities may deliver benefits to both farmers and the wider community, an overall conclusion is that none of these, on their own, will transform the nature of Australian agriculture.Instead, the greatest emerging opportunity for Australian agriculture must be sought from productivity breakthroughs in the face of current and emerging constraints. This view is formed by looking through the lens of the global food production challenge which sees a demand for close to a doubling of food production by 2050 in the face of increasingly constrained land and water resources, soil degradation, increasing energy scarcity and limits on greenhouse gas release to the atmosphere. These same land, water, soil, energy and atmospheric constraints to agriculture apply in Australia and will shape both farming and the agricultural research agenda over coming decades.In the face of such national and global agronomic challenges, a significant threat looms with the skills challenge facing agricultural science in Australia.

Rising atmospheric [CO2] (eCO(2)) is likely to alter the production and activity of fine roots, with important consequences for forest carbon storage. Yet empirical evidence of the role of eCO(2)in driving root dynamics is limited, particularly for grassy woodlands, an ecosystem type of global importance. We sampled fine roots across seasons over a 2-year period to examine the effects of eCO(2)on their biomass, production, turnover and functional traits in a native mature grassyEucalyptuswoodland in eastern Australia (EucFACE). Fine root biomass, production and turnover varied greatly through time, increasing as soil water content declined. Despite a lack of consistent effects of eCO(2)on fine root biomass, production or turnover across the 2-year sampling period, we found enhanced production pulses under eCO(2)between 10- and 30-cm soil depth. In addition, eCO(2)led to greater carbon and phosphorus concentrations in fine roots and increased root diameter, but no detectable effects on other morphological traits. Synthesis. We found minor quantitative effects of eCO(2)on fine root biomass dynamics that were largely driven by temporal variations in soil water availability. Our results suggest that in this mature grassy woodland, and perhaps also in other similar forested ecosystem types, eCO(2)effects are small and transient.

A study of the far-field measurement of seismic pulses throughout the Gully MPA and specifically the Gully Whale Sanctuary was therefore initiated to directly measure noise levels produced by the seismic pulses and to validate the accuracy of sound propagation predictions published in the environmental assessment (EA). Our results showed that the noise levels predicted in the EA were on average underestimated by 8 dB. This finding is significant since the results of sound propagation models are used by regulators to define the safety radius for marine mammals around seismic arrays, i.e., < 180 dB. The highest average sound pressure level (RMS) measured in the Gully MPA during the present study was 145 dB re 1 mu Pa at 90 in depth, 50 kin from the seismic array. This sound level was measured within the Gully Whale Sanctuary while the seismic vessel was surveying the western portion of the exploration block. It was estimated that sound levels in the Whale Sanctuary would have been between approximately 153 and 157 dB when the vessel was at its closest approach to the Gully in the eastern portion of the survey block. The worst case sound level at the Gully MPA boundary, i.e., 0.8 kin from the source, extrapolated from near-field measurements would have been approximately 178 dB, 14 dB higher than originally predicted in the EA and close to the 180 dB safety criteria. Measured sound levels were also significantly higher than the model predictions at several other stations and showed significant variability around the mean values. This demonstrates the importance of using accurate model input data, of using field validation to verify the model predictions and of the need to measure the variability around the mean sound level estimates.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0706-6457,0706-6570,,,,,,,,,,"Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Inst Maurice Lamontagne, Hydroacoust Lab, 850 Route Mer, Mont Joli, PQ G5H 3Z4, Canada",,,,2005-01-01,BCI:BCI200600299185,,

Nevertheless, the global molecular epidemiology of SAB and its possible association with specific virulence factors remains unclear. Using DNA microarrays, a total of 833 S. aureus strains (785 SAB and 48 colonizing strains) collected in Spain over a period of 15 years (2002-2017) were characterized to determine clonal complex (CC), agr type and repertoire of resistance and virulence genes in order to provide an epidemiological overview of CCs causing bloodstream infection, and to analyze possible associations between virulence genes and the most common sources of bacteremia. The results were also analyzed by acquisition (healthcare-associated [HA] and community-acquired [CA]), methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) strains, and patient age (adults vs. children). Our results revealed high clonal diversity among SAB strains with up to 28 different CCs. The most prevalent CCs were CC5 (30.8%), CC30 (20.3%), CC45 (8.3%), CC8 (8.4%), CC15 (7.5%), and CC22 (5.9%), which together accounted for 80% of all cases.

Carbon is in all living things, the ocean, the earth, and the atmosphere. Increasing carbon in the atmosphere has led to climate change, which has had major effects across the globe. One effect has been increasing wildfires in northern ecosystems. In these ecosystems, large amounts of carbon are stored in soils. This carbon can be stored for a long time and is sometimes very old. Wildfires that burn these soils can release this old carbon to the atmosphere and cause more climate warming. This project will determine where and when this old carbon is burning. This information will help us understand how increasing wildfires will affect future climate. It will also help fire managers set priorities for where to fight fires. We will share our results with rural northern communities near our research sites and with citizens and youth of Northern Arizona.<br/><br/>This research will investigate how increasing wildfires will impact the long-term carbon storage of Arctic ecosystems. Arctic ecosystems store over 40% of terrestrial carbon and have historically been considered carbon sinks. This means they store more carbon than they lose to the atmosphere. Carbon in these ecosystems is primarily stored in soils for long periods, sometimes centuries. Periodic wildfires release some soil carbon to the atmosphere. Any soil carbon that escapes burning in a previous fire is called 'legacy carbon.' Due to climate warming, wildfires have increased in frequency and severity in northern ecosystems. More severe and frequent wildfires can combust legacy carbon and shift Arctic ecosystems from a carbon sink to a carbon source to the atmosphere. The main objective of this research is to determine the processes that control legacy carbon combustion. Understanding where and when legacy carbon combustion is likely to occur is essential for predicting how frequently Arctic ecosystems will shift from a carbon sink to a carbon source. These results will benefit global stakeholders, including policymakers, by improving our understanding of the mechanisms through which environmental change affects the global carbon cycle and climate. For regional and local stakeholders, such as fire managers, this research will improve our ability to identify areas vulnerable to legacy carbon combustion to better prioritize management decisions. We will share our results with fire managers by partnering with the Alaska Fire Science Consortium. We will also engage with rural communities in Interior Alaska by hiring a local guide and communicating our research goals, progress, and findings with community members. Finally, we will engage with citizens, particularly youth, of Northern Arizona about Arctic research by participating in our local festival of science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2019485,,,,,,,,"Woodwell Climate Research Center, Inc.","Woodwell Climate Research Center, Inc.",,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15134427,,

In this study, we explored a method to improve the size selectivity of traps by mounting escape vents at the ends of each trap. The selectivity of accordion-shaped traps with escape vents of size 6, 7, and 8 cm was tested using a catch comparison method. A theoretical Mature Body Length (MBL) of 15 cm was defined as the reference point to support the interpretation of results. The results demonstrated a decrease in the retention of immature fish with the enlargement of escape vent size. Based on the retention rate and estimated percentage of individuals below and above the MBL, the 6 and 8 cm escape vent sizes were not considered appropriate for sustainable fishery. However, the 7 cm escape vent size was found to retain most of the mature black rockfish, while releasing the majority of immature black rockfish; hence, it can be considered a gear option for sustainable resource utilization.

Next, Langmuir circulation models are used to approximate the merging of oiled bands. Calculations are performed on Troll blended and Alaska North Slope crude oils and results compared with measurements from the 1990s North Sea field experiments.

Extensive sampling protocol was performed along the submerging upland tidal marsh soils to model C sequestration. Coastal marsh soils are accreting vertically and migrating laterally over the low-lying forest soils to keep pace with sealevel rise. The predictive C sequestration model was a two-step linear function. Therefore, C sequestration will continue to occur by accumulation in the organic horizons and sea-level rise is the driving force. During the last 150 yr, the rate of C sequestration averaged 83.5 +/- 23 g m(-2) yr(-1).

The R&D effort required to make oil and gas technologies available for the next decade calls for concerted research to be done, for only coordinated research will prevent the dispersal of French efforts (Fig. 6).Increasing economically exploitable reserves, mastering production costs and reducing the costs of ''gas chains'' from producing fields to consumer regions, while ensuring environmental production, are the challenges that have to be faced. To cope with these expectations for the industry, great research efforts must be made in the corresponding scientific areas so as to gain a better understanding of phenomena and to develop the most suitable solutions (Fig. 7). The leading R&D axes to be promoted between now and 2000 are then explained. Reducing exploration risks requires, above all, a better petroleum assessment of basins. The progress expected will be based on the scaling up of 2D basin modeling to 3D modeling for assessing the ultimate reserves of a basin (Fig. 8 and Plate 1). Improving the determining of the geometry of subsurface geologic structures will benefit from progress in structural imaging, whose aim is to obtain an assessment of the position and shape of seismic reflectors.These are geologic concepts (the understanding the geologist has of the architecture of deltaic or alluvial deposits, of different types of reefs, etc.) which, based on geostatistics and expressed by numerical modeling, will make lithological interpolation among wells (Fig. 9 and Plate II), thus leading to the better characterization of reservoirs. In structures where there is already a good understanding of the formations, the progress expected for the years to come, thanks to geophysical techniques, will involve prestack inversion, which will ascertain important characteristics such as the presence of gas or even the distinction of two fluids as well as the obtaining of three-dimensional data. Concerning production from fields, the stakes for R&D are considerable since the problem is now to produce from the great majority of small and structurally complex fields, or even, in some countries, to resume production from fields hampered by a relatively rustic recovery method. Such undertakings are essentially based on a better understanding of reservoir dynamics. On line of reflection that is certainly important for the future will be to analyze behavior laws in complex cases. In this area as well, numerical modeling is what will synthesize all the data (Plate V).After the reservoir has been characterized and the production method decided upon, it is indispensable to ascertain the most effective ways of operating. In this area, the technical mastery sought after aims to reduce the cost-to-quantities produced ratio while ensuring environmental protection, for example such as replacing oil-base driling fluids by nonpolluting fluids. Achieving optimum production at less cost will require better use of the processing capacities already in place. This will be achieved by the development of multiphase production, in particular for marginal or deep offshore fields. Concerning new production systems and within a context in which oil companies are seeking to exploit marginal fields and deep-water discoveries under the best possible economic conditions, the Nomad project (Plate VI) for multiphase evacuation via a light floating support seems to be destined for a great future. To decrease costs, another alternative is to use automated and unmanned installations.Gas transportation often entails the constraint of exorbitant costs, thus compromising the competitivity of gas projects. This is especially the case for the international transport of natural gas in the form of LNG, which will expand in the most competitive markets only if decisive technological progress is achieved so as to bring about a substantial decrease in costs throughout the entire LNG chain. Lastly, the chemical conversion of natural gas into fuels or petrochemical base stocks may be considered as an alternative solution to liquefaction for production from gas fields very far away from the consumer markets. For both economic and environmental reasons, natural gas appears to be the best possible base stock for manufacturing synthetic fuels. All in all, scientific and technological progress required for the increasing of economically exploitable reserves, for gaining greater accessibility to oil and gas resources, and to better target use of energy in the face of environmental production, require an appreciable increase in research efforts. Such a policy is inconcevable without having recourse to more widespread partnership and without incentives and substantial financing by both French and European public authorities.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0020-2274,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1993-03-01,WOS:A1993KZ98200001,,
