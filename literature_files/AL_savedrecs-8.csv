The vast majority of deep-sea communities depend on a particulate organic carbon food supply that sinks from photosynthetically active surface waters. Variations in food supply depend, in part, on surface climate conditions. Proposed ocean iron fertilization efforts are also intended to alter surface production and carbon export from surface waters. Understanding the ecology of the abyssal sediment community and constituent metazoan macrofauna is important because they influence carbon and nutrient cycle processes at the seafloor through remineralization, bioturbation, and burial of the sunken material. Results from a 10-year study in the abyssal NE Pacific found that climate-driven variations in food availability were linked to total metazoan macrofauna abundance, phyla composition, rank-abundance distributions, and remineralization over seasonal and interannual scales. The long-term analysis suggests that broad biogeographic patterns in deep-sea macrofauna community structure can change over contemporary timescales with changes in surface ocean conditions and provides significant evidence that sediment community parameters can be estimated from atmospheric and upper-ocean conditions. These apparent links between climate, the upper ocean, and deep-sea biogeochemistry need to be considered in determining the long-term carbon storage capacity of the ocean.",,,,,,,,,103,1,0,0,84,0,112,,,0027-8424,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Oceanog Ctr, Ocean Biogeochem & Ecosyst DEEPSEAS Grp, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, EnglandMonterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA",,,,2008-11-04,WOS:000260913800039,18974223,

Therefore several sites around the coast of the United Kingdom (UK) have been identified to have the potential to host multiple array turbine developments that could be used to generate upwards of 100MW each.However, the high tidal energy environment required to provide the input to tidal power devices present a combination of design and installation challenges to developers and engineers. Whilst the water depths are comparable to offshore oil and gas projects in the southern North Sea, tidal energy projects present significantly different seabed and associated geotechnical challenges that require novel solutions.Concerns have been expressed regarding the design of turbine base structures, which is often based upon typical nearshore/offshore soil sampling and geotechnical laboratory testing techniques that are often inappropriate for the seabed materials encountered. This issue is further compounded by the design constraints imposed on the base structure foundations (e.g. tripod gravity base structures). These include strict leveling tolerances required for efficient turbine operation, and which require a detailed understanding of seabed bathymetry at each turbine location where multiple seabed contact points may be required.In addition to the tidal energy turbines, inter-array cables that connect the turbines and export cable routes which distribute the power to shore also present their own design and installation challenges. It is often overlooked, but significant uncertainty lies in the definition of cable corridors with respect to the seabed materials. In many cases burial may be considered as a means of product protection where seabed conditions allow.This paper aims to examine the geotechnical issues associated with the difficult seabed and environmental conditions present at typical tidal turbine sites in the UK and globally in an attempt to offer some potential solutions. These issues typically include; difficulties in performing site investigation operations, coarse mobile seabed sediments, challenging seabed topography, exposed bedrock and hard substrates, derivation of appropriate geotechnical parameters, difficulties in foundation design and installation, high cyclic environmental loading, array and export cable lay, on-bottom stability and mechanical protection, amongst others.",,,,,"33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 08-13, 2014JUN 08-13, 2014","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn Div","San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4553-0,,,,,,,,,"Xodus Grp, Aberdeen, ScotlandUniv Dundee, Dundee, Scotland",Xodus Grp,,,2015-11-18,WOS:000363499000055,,

In Norway, much of the CO2 is emitted from the oil and gas sector. In Denmark the power and heat production comprises the largest share while in Sweden and Finland biomass based industry such as power and heat production in CHP plants and pulp and paper production generates most of the CO2 emissions. Iceland emits most CO2 from metal industry, in particular non-ferrous metal production. In a Nordic perspective, the oil and gas industry has a high potential for implementation of CCS along with iron and steel production and cement production. Only cement production and pulp and paper production industries seem to have potential to decrease the CO2 emissions close to zero. Capturing biogenic CO2 from pulp and paper production could remove CO2 from the atmosphere and create a carbon sink. Clustering of emission sources and implementing a joint CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) chain could possibly lower the CCS unit costs. Process alterations and industry specific solutions due to the implementation of CCS in industry could improve existing processes. However, the possibility for carbon leakage could decrease the competitiveness of Nordic industries significantly as long as there is no global agreement on reduction of CO2 emissions.

However, the marine domain is a notoriously difficult and dangerous environment in which to operate which makes traditional patrolling surveillance methods expensive. As a result, the country's maritime monitoring capabilities are now quite limited at a time when there is increasing need to have situational awareness of UK territorial waters.SiriusInsight has developed a capability to use artificial intelligence to analyse remotely sourced data (both satellite and terrestrial) which avoids the need for human involvement in either the data collection or its processing.SiriusInsight will use its Innovate grant to develop further this capability, bringing together and enhancing current state-of-art approaches from other domains, and train its algorithms in pattern of life analysis so that it can be used for monitoring and alerting in a way which will greatly enhance coverage at minimal cost relative to the alternatives. This technology has a wide range of monitoring applications and potential users: e.g. sea safety (Coastguard), illegal migration and smuggling (Border Force) and fishery protection (DEFRA).Real-time situational awareness based on the SiriusInsight product can also be used to enhance collision avoidance for commercial shipping with particular application for vessels with restricted ability to manoeuvre (like survey vessels) and autonomous shipping. There are also applications for enhanced pattern of life analysis in planning for offshore developments like wind farms.Combining artificial intelligence with the marine domain brings together two areas where the UK has the opportunity to continue as a world leader.

Other factors, however, could exacerbate the impacts of sea ice loss on polar bears, such as exposure to increased industrial activity. The Arctic Ocean has enormous oil and gas potential, and its development is expected to increase in the coming decades. Estimates of polar bear resource selection will inform managers how bears use areas slated for oil development and to help guide conservation planning. We estimated temporally-varying resource selection patterns for non-denning adult female polar bears in the Chukchi Sea population (20082012) at two scales (i.e., home range and weekly steps) to identify factors predictive of polar bear use throughout the year, before any offshore development. From the best models at each scale, we estimated scale-integrated resource selection functions to predict polar bear space use across the population's range and determined when bears were most likely to use the region where offshore oil and gas development in the United States is slated to occur. Polar bears exhibited significant intra-annual variation in selection patterns at both scales but the strength and annual patterns of selection differed between scales for most variables. Bears were most likely to use the offshore oil and gas planning area during ice retreat and growth with the highest predicted use occurring in the southern portion of the planning area. The average proportion of predicted high-value habitat in the planning area was >15% of the total high-value habitat for the population during sea ice retreat and growth and reached a high of 50% during November 2010.

The current study used a novel, non-destructive sampling approach involving the deployment of a drop net around study plots to compare the nektonic assemblages associated with intertidal oyster reefs (natural and enhanced) with those of neighboring soft sediment habitats at 3 sites in South Carolina. At each site, the nektonic organisms collected on a reef plot were compared with those collected on an adjacent control plot lacking a structurally complex habitat. Nekton abundance was significantly higher on the reef plot compared with the control plot at all 3 sites. Nekton abundance also varied among seasons, with the greatest numbers occurring during summer compared with spring and fall. Notably, grass shrimp (Palaemonetes spp.) were especially dominant on reef plots. A total of 60 taxa were identified, 57 of which were identified to species level. Reef plots exhibited significantly greater taxon richness than control plots. The number of taxa present also accumulated over time at a higher rate on the reef plots than on the control plots at 2 of the 3 sites. Among the 60 taxa collected, 36 were found on both the reef and control plots, whereas 14 taxa were unique to the reef plots. For data pooled across all sites and seasons, 33 taxa were more numerous on reef plots than control plots, 3 taxa occurred in equal numbers, and 24 taxa were more numerous on control plots. For taxa collected on more than 1 occasion, paired t-tests performed with Bonferroni-adjusted significance thresholds revealed that Alpheus heterochaelis and Palaemonetes spp. were significantly more abundant on the reef plots than on the control plots, whereas unadjusted analyses revealed the same pattern for Gobiosoma bosc, Menidia menidia, and Fundulus heteroclitus. In contrast, no taxa were significantly more abundant on the control plots at either significance threshold. Although nekton abundance was generally higher on the reef plots, measures of diversity were significantly higher on the control plots, regardless of season, site, or date. Greater abundance of a limited number of species on the reef plots accounted for lower evenness and therefore lower diversity measures for this treatment. Overall, community structure was driven more by site than by treatment, whereas the seasonal occurrences of certain species on the reef plots highlighted the importance of oyster reefs as essential fish habitat for the critical life stages of finfish species with complex life histories.",,,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,24,0,36,,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,,,,,,,,,"Marine Resources Res Inst, S Carolina Dept Nat Resources, Charleston, SC 29422 USAColl Charleston, Grice Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29412 USA",Marine Resources Res Inst,,,2013-03-13,WOS:000313389200013,,

However, many reefs have been lost or severely degraded through anthropogenic effects like dredging, channelization, or sedimentation. Constructed reefs have been used to mitigate these effects in some systems, but these reefs are also subject to degradation which may warrant custodial maintenance. Monitoring and maintenance of natural or constructed spawning reefs are not common practices; therefore, few methodologies have been created to test the effectiveness of such tools. We conducted a literature review to assess available information on maintenance of rocky spawning habitats used by lithophilic fishes. We identified 54 rocky spawning habitat maintenance projects, most of which aimed to improve fish spawning habitats through the addition of spawning substrate (n= 33) or cleaning of substrate (n= 23). In comparison to shallow riverine studies focused on salmonids, we found little information on deep-water reefs, marine reefs, or other fish species. We discuss the possible application of potential spawning habitat cleaning methods from other disciplines (e.g., treasure hunting; archeology) that may provide effective means of reef maintenance that can be used by restoration practitioners.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,4,0,6,,,,2073-4441,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey Great Lakes Sci Ctr, 1451 Green Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USAUniv Toledo, Dept Environm Sci, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USAUS Fish & Wildlife Serv, Lower Great Lakes Fish & Wildlife Conservat Off, 1101 Casey Rd, Basom, NY 14103 USAPurdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, Forestry Bldg,195 Marsteller St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USAIllinois Indiana Sea Grant Coll Program, 195 Marsteller St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USAUS Fish & Wildlife Serv, Alpena Fish & Wildlife Conservat Off, 5437 West Jefferson Ave, Trenton, MI 48183 USA",US Geol Survey Great Lakes Sci CtrIllinois Indiana Sea Grant Coll Program,,,2020-11-03,WOS:000580202600001,,

This study will use new telemetry techniques to help answer fundamental questions about how predators can regulate local populations of marine fish, leading to a better understanding of both fish population dynamics and also potential impacts of fishing and other human activities. The investigator will capture, tag, and acoustically track up to 20 small bar jack, following their movement (along with their associated schools) for 5 weeks during August and September 2000. The study area, in the Bahamas, will be a matrix of 32 natural and 16 artificial reefs, where prey density can be experimentally manipulated. The goal is to determine: whether tagged jacks spend more time at reefs with high prey densities, as previously documented using remote video samples; whether jacks move randomly or systematically among reefs; and what the overall range of movement of the predator is. The data should provide new insights on the behavioral mechanisms by which predators cause density-dependent mortality and lead to more detailed studes that separate the relative roles of aggregative vs. functional responses in predator-prey dynamics among marine fishes.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,3038,,,,,,,,Oregon State University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13914281,,

This large scale benthic concentration of oil is suggested to have occurred via the process of Marine Oil Snow Sedimentation and Flocculent Accumulation (MOSSFA). This meta-analysis investigates whether MOSSFA occurred in other large oil spills and identifies the main drivers of oil sedimentation. MOSSFA was found to have occurred during the IXTOC I blowout and possibly during the Santa Barbara blowout. Unfortunately, benthic effects were not sufficiently studied for the 52 spills we reviewed. However, based on the current understanding of drivers involved, we conclude that MOSSFA and related benthic contamination may be widespread. We suggest to collect and analyze sediment cores at specific spill locations, as improved understanding of the MOSSFA process will allow better informed spill responses in the future, taking into account possible massive oil sedimentation and smothering of (deep) benthic ecosystems.

The fundamental concern of the program was the effect that development of offshore energy reserves might have upon dense assemblages of deep-sea organisms, particularly chemosynthetic tubeworms, mussels, and clams, as well as fish and crustaceans, that live in association with them. Hydrocarbons from commercial oil and gas reserves escape into the sea bottom at natural seeps found commonly across the Gulf of Mexico's northern continental slope. Chemosynthetic animals utilize chemical energy from hydrocarbons to maintain colonies that have unusually high biomass compared with the sea bottom elsewhere. Chemosynthetic communities at hydrocarbon seeps were discovered in 1984 and have been previously investigated in studies funded by MMS. However, more knowledge was needed about the life history and ecology of chemosynthetic communities in the Gulf of Mexico. The program has produced a substantial body of findings, which include numerous peer-reviewed publications and student theses in addition to the results detailed in the final report.

This approach was developed according to three stages: knowing biodiversity, protecting biodiversity and, going further, by contributing to scientific research. This three step approach is embedded in an environment protection policy and an associated set of actions already implemented for many years. Knowledge of the biodiversity is an indispensable preliminary to evaluating the sensitivity of a site which is likely to be impacted by an industrial activity. TOTAL E&P Indon,sie (TI) has been operating for over 30 years in the East part of Borneo Island in areas of increasing sensitivity with respect to mangrove ecosystems; for example the Mahakam delta which includes the Tambora, Handil and Tunu fields. This area was initially covered by dense mangrove vegetation. Regular biodiversity surveys in the delta, especially for fishes, birds and benthos, have allowed TI to witness the progressive changes occurring in the delta. Reducing significant impacts and conserving biodiversity is considered as an integral part of sustainable development. With regard to the Mahakam delta, in the last decades there has been a marked increase of local population activities and deforestation due to shrimp-culture development. TI has made significant efforts with environmental management actions to protect the mangrove ecosystem through several environmental programs such as minimizing land clearing and reinstating cleared areas. The programs have involved local communities and other stakeholders such as NGO's and governmental bodies. Contributing to scientific knowledge of biodiversity is of mutual interest to both science and industry. The TOTAL Group, through its Foundation for Biodiversity and the Sea, has supported the establishment of a comprehensive inventory of the marine biodiversity of the island of Panglao, situated southwest of Bohol, Philippines. The Panglao Marine Biodiversity project was driven in collaboration between the Mus,um National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, and the University of San Carlos, Cebu City, Philippines. Recently, another major biodiversity inventory has been also supported by the TOTAL Foundation: the Santo 2006 biodiversity project. On this island, located in the Vanuatu archipelago, the research program has focused on four themes: marine, forest, karstic environments and alien species. Furthermore, TOTAL in partnership with IFREMER, a French oceanographic research centre, has also developed a comprehensive biodiversity research and development program dedicated to Deep Sea ecosystems. Even if initially focused off Western Africa, this emerging issue is also of concern in most of the tropical areas in the world where deep offshore environments are present.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,5,1,8,,,0960-3115,1572-9710,,,,,,,,,,"TOTAL SA, DGEP HSE ENV, F-92078 Paris, FranceTOTAL E&P Indonesie, DSE ENV, Jalan Yos Sudarso, E Kalimantan 76123, Balikpapan, Indonesia",TOTAL E&P Indonesie,,,2010-02-01,WOS:000273978600021,,

Since 2008, sanctuary sponsored archeological research has branched out to include historically significant U-boats and World War II shipwrecks within the larger Graveyard of the Atlantic off the coast of North Carolina. These shipwrecks are not only important for their cultural value, but also as habitat for a wide diversity of fishes, invertebrates and algal species. Additionally, due to their unique location within an important area for biological productivity, the sanctuary and other culturally valuable shipwrecks within the Graveyard of the Atlantic are potential sites for examining community change. For this reason, from June 8-30, 2010, biological and ecological investigations were conducted at four World War II shipwrecks (Keshena, City of Atlanta, Dixie Arrow, EM Clark), as part of the MNMS 2010 Battle of the Atlantic (BOTA) research project. At each shipwreck site, fish community surveys were conducted and benthic photo-quadrats were collected to characterize the mobile conspicuous fish, smaller prey fish, and sessile invertebrate and algal communities. In addition, temperature sensors were placed at all four shipwrecks previously mentioned, as well as an additional shipwreck, the Manuela. The data, which establishes a baseline condition to use in future assessments, suggest strong differences in both the fish and benthic communities among the surveyed shipwrecks based on the oceanographic zone (depth). In order to establish these shipwrecks as sites for detecting community change it is suggested that a subset of locations across the shelf be selected and repeatedly sampled over time. In order to reduce variability within sites for both the benthic and fish communities, a significant number of surveys should be conducted at each location. This sampling strategy will account for the natural differences in community structure that exist across the shelf due to the oceanographic regime, and allow robust statistical analyses of community differences over time.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012-02-07,ZOOREC:ZOOR14802009717,,

Many activities of recreational diving do not particularly require coral reefs - any varied three-dimensional structure (e.g. a wreck) may be sufficiently attractive. The conflict between the needs of nature conservation and the economic interests of diving tourism can be mitigated by the formation of artificial underwater attractions as reef substitutes. Based on experiments in the northern Red Sea, we propose to deposit calcium minerals from the seawater in situ by electrolysis on a template of any desired shape, After transplantation of Living coral fragments, a diverse community will develop. With this method different modules can be designed and formed on the seabed which can serve different needs such as diver training, environmental education and recreation as well as reef rehabilitation. By a combination of such modules, a recreational underwater park can be formed well suited to function as a DAD (diver aggregation device) and therefore, divert diver pressure from the natural reef.

Coastal erosion started in the 1980s, principally due to reduction of fluvial sediment discharges, wave attack, and both anthropic and natural subsidence. The intervention consisted in a small beach nourishment, shallow feeder berm construction, and the placement of an artificial reef to retain the sand fill. Topo-bathymetrical surveys with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS, multi beam surveys, sediment samplings, wave data records, dive inspections and numerical simulations were undertaken over a 3-year monitoring period to analyse the process-response mechanism of this intervention, to assess the main factors affecting the performance of the mixed intervention and the possibility of using fine sediments for nourishment practices.The results reveal a generally positive impact characterised by short-term beach stability that was mostly due to the feeder berm effect The beach nourishment had a short but direct effect on the beach width, while the feeder berm dissipated wave energy and successively fed the nearshore with eroded sediment On the other hand, the artificial reef did not retain the sand, but rather induced rip currents that increased eddy circulation and, therefore, promoted the loss of offshore sediment. Settlement and scouring problems were also observed and the structure's failure induced safety problems.The results confirm that a feeder berm operation carried out with fine sediment represents a good solution, although particular attention must be paid to the relationship between sediment grain sizes, volume, and location of the nourishment, as they are the key factors for good performance. Finally, the cross-shore sediment transport represents a critical factor that controls the coastal evolution of beaches bounded by hard structures and assimilated to the littoral cell. Consequently, it should be better integrated within the nourishment design and model setting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we present a case study on the feasibility of extracting ecological metrics from archeological studies of shipwrecks. Even though shipwrecks that are the focus of archeological surveys also form habitat for diverse flora and fauna, shipwrecks are often studied separately by archeologists and ecologists. Conducting joint archeological and ecological surveys promises to maximize research resources and outputs, yet this cross-disciplinary approach is rare. Here, we test the feasibility of extracting ecological metrics from archeological surveys of two historically significant and deep (200 m) shipwrecks, the German U-boat U-576 and the Nicaraguan freighter SS Bluefields, which sank in close proximity to one another on the continental shelf of North Carolina, USA during World War II. First, we assessed fish density, community composition, behavior, and spatial distribution on these shipwrecks using video and laser-line scanning data collected from human-occupied submersibles during archeological surveys. Second, we examined the ecological benefits and biases of pairing laser-line scanning and video surveys designed for archeological specifications. Our approach allowed us to pinpoint locations of fish around the shipwrecks and to identify these fish to fine taxonomic levels. The extracted ecological data revealed that both shipwrecks hosted high densities (U-576 38.2 +/- 4.0; SS Bluefields 32.0 +/- 18.0 per along-ship transect) of demersal fishes, including grouper species, and that fish concentrated around high-relief shipwreck features.

Several wave power techniques are on the merge of commercialisation, and thus evoke questions of environmental concern. Conservation matters are to some extent valid independent of technique but we mainly focus on point absorbing linear generators. By giving examples from the Lysekil project, run by Uppsala University and situated on the Swedish west coast, we demonstrate ongoing and future environmental studies to be performed along with technical research and development. We describe general environmental aspects generated by wave power projects; issues also likely to appear in Environmental Impact Assessment studies. Colonisation patterns and biofouling are discussed with particular reference to changes of the seabed and alterations due to new substrates. A purposeful artificial reef design to specially cater for economically important or threatened species is also discussed. Questions related to fish, fishery and marine mammals are other examples of topics where, e.g. no-take zones, marine bioacoustics and electromagnetic fields are important areas. In this review we point out areas in which studies likely will be needed, as ventures out in the oceans also will give ample opportunities for marine environmental research in general and in areas not previously studied. Marine environmental and ecological aspects appear to be unavoidable for application processes and in post-deployment studies concerning renewable energy extraction. Still, all large-scale renewable energy conversion will cause some impact mainly by being area demanding. An early incorporation of multidisciplinary and high quality research might be a key for new ocean-based techniques. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The findings show that the primary contaminant(s) of concern are contained in both the dissolved oil and the dispersed oil. The application of emerging technologies that can tackle this issue is significantly limited by the challenges of offshore operations in harsh/Arctic environments.

Despite their important ecological roles in the cycling of energy and nutrients in food webs, effects on bacteria, protists or arthropods are often neglected. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding was applied to characterize changes in the structure of micro- and macro-biota communities of surface sediments over a 7 year period since the occurrence of Hebei Spirit oil spill on December 7, 2007. Alterations in diversities and structures of micro- and macro-biota were observed in the contaminated area where concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were greater. Successions of bacterial, protists and metazoan communities revealed long-term ecological effects of residual oil. Residual oil dominated the largest cluster of the community-environment association network. Presence of bacterial families (Aero-coccaceae and Carnobacteriaceae) and the protozoan family (Platyophryidae) might have conferred sensitivity of communities to oil pollution. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial families (Anaerolinaceae, Desulfobacteraceae, Helicobacteraceae and Piscirickettsiaceae) and algal family (Araphid pennate) were resistant to adverse effects of spilt oil. The protistan family (Subulatomonas) and arthropod families (Folsomia, Sarcophagidae Opomyzoidea, and Anomura) appeared to be positively associated with residual oil pollution. eDNA metabarcoding can provide a powerful tool for assessing effects of anthropogenic pollution, such as oil spills on sediment communities and its long-term trends in coastal marine environments.

In order to assess interactions of local factors that influence the distribution and abundance of reef fishes within a coastal mosaic of rocky reefs, we tested the null hypothesis of no significant variation in fish assemblage structure, by comparing 33 sites along the northern coast of the Sao Paulo State, Southeastern Brazil. Replicated stationary visual census samples (n = 396) were obtained at different distances from the coast, depths and wave exposures, including the mainland, three relatively small coastal islands, and the two margins of a wide channel between the mainland and the large Sao Sebastiao Island (similar to 350 km(2)), totaling 225 h of SCUBA diving. The regional rocky shore fish fauna comprised 106 species (41 families), with preponderance of diurnal mobile-invertebrate feeders. Samples from the outer margin of the Sao Sebastiao Island, together with those from Alcatrazes, Buzios, and Vitoria islands were significantly dissimilar from samples from the coastal sites at the Sao Sebastiao Channel. Species richness tended to increase in a gradient from the coast to the more offshore islands. Local conditions such as depth and other habitat characteristics also influenced fish assemblages' structure. Distance from coast and depth were the main predictors for fish assemblages, followed by water transparency, temperature and benthic cover. This study represents the first regional-scale assessment of fish assemblages associated with rocky reefs in the Sao Paulo State coast, filling a major geographic knowledge gap in the South Atlantic. As the study region is experiencing fast coastal development and growing threats from seaport expansion, oil and gas exploitation, as well as increasing fishing and tourism pressure, the understanding of the underlying factors that influence the distribution and abundance of the reef-associated biota comprises a relevant baseline for monitoring, conservation planning and management.",,,,,,,,,28,1,0,0,23,7,31,,,1679-6225,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed ABC UFABC, CCNH, BR-09210170 Santo Andre, SP, BrazilUniv Sao Paulo CEBIMar USP, Ctr Biol Marinha, Sao Sebastiao, SP, BrazilUniv Fed Rio de Janeiro, Ctr Ciencias Saude, Inst Biol, Ilha Fundao, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Univ Fed ABC UFABC,,,2012-06-29,WOS:000306236900012,,

As a transplant control, ten juvenile sporophytes of E. cava growing in Nakagi Bay were also transplanted to the same artificial reefs. Growth and survival rates of the sporophytes were monitored monthly for 3 y until December 1998. The transplanted sporophytes showed an increase in their stipe length and diameter from winter to spring, whereas almost no increase was observed from summer to autumn. However, the elongation was greater in Nabeta sporophytes than in Nakagi sporophytes. The primary blade length increased mainly from winter to early spring and decreased largely in autumn. Average primary blade lengths were similar in both Nabeta and Nakagi sporophytes from the end of the first year of transplanting.

The Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic has also become ice-free several times in recent summers, a significant change. All of the Arctic countries, including Russia, the United States, Canada, and Denmark (Greenland) are exploring the limits of their arctic continental shelves in order to advance claims under the Law of the Sea Treaty. Within this context of environmental and likely socio-economic changes, wildlife populations and human communities are adjusting to these shifts in seasonal sea ice coverage and climatic warming that has been much more obvious than at lower latitudes. Subsistence hunting patterns in the Arctic are changing, and it is also clear that many organisms, from plankton to top predators may be changing their migration and foraging patterns. Productivity is also forecast to change as sea ice declines and penetration of sunlight into open water increases. The Pacific Marine Arctic Regional Synthesis (*PacMARS*) is a research synthesis effort underwritten by the North Pacific Marine Research Institute to assemble by mid-year 2013 up-to-date written documentation that contributes to understanding the Pacific-influenced coastal shelf ecosystem of the Arctic Ocean. Our study's year range is from 1970-2017 and our study area extends from Saint Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea through Bering Strait into the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Our objective is to compile the best available knowledge from local communities, peer-reviewed social and natural sciences, as well as less readily available knowledge sources. The overall goal is to provide guidance for scientific research needs in the region, as well as to serve stakeholder needs for understanding this important ecosystem and its vulnerabilities.

Relatively little effort has been put into answering the question how one would use suites of indicators to meet the multiple conservation objectives defined in operational plans. Such an exercise is being undertaken on the eastern Scotian Shelf off Canada's east coast, as a national integrated management pilot. A number of ocean industries - fishing, oil and gas exploration, transport, and the military - utilize the area, a typical situation elsewhere in the world. A suite of conceptual ecosystem-level objectives has been identified to address biodiversity, productivity, and habitat issues. Operational objectives, which identify an indicator and reference points associated with each conceptual objective, are then stated. Utilizing this framework, individual ocean industry plans and activities can be reviewed in a consistent manner, to determine how they might be constrained by the conservation objectives for the area. Issues of spatial scale and cumulative impacts are addressed, and comment is made on future developments.

Populations continue to decline despite the closure of the fishery in 1996. There has been little to no evidence of recruitment in southern California from population surveys and in artificial reefs targeting white abalone recruitment since the listing of the species. A 13-y time series of white abalone abundance in prime habitat, surveyed with a remote-operated vehicle, was used in a population viability analysis to quantify: (1) the population decline and (2) the time to reach a quasiextinction threshold. The annual decline in the population is 12%, which is comparable to adult natural mortality rates for abalone species. The quasi-extinction threshold of 1,000 individuals is met within 15 y. These results confirm that the white abalone populations in southern California are at high risk of extinction, and highlight the importance of active stocking and restoration for the species. To inform restoration, a deterministic density-dependent size-based matrix model was developed to investigate different stocking scenarios, incorporating an innovative method for modeling low populations by setting the reproductive term as a function of adult density to mimic a reproductive Allee effect. A minimum density of 0.14 abalone/m(2) of stocked juveniles led to a maximum population growth rate (lambda) of more than or equal to 1 for the model population within 10 y but that recovery was poor (mean lambda(15-20) <= 1.0) over time if the level of juvenile stocking was less than 0.23 abalone/m(2) in the model population. The innovative approach of incorporating adult density into the reproductive term in the model quantitatively shows how low population densities can impact threatened and endangered species, and may be widely used for other species. These results can not only help guide stocking strategies but also allow for the quantitative evaluation of white abalone under the guidance of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, suggesting that white abalone should be considered Critically Endangered.",,,,,9th International Abalone Symposium9th International Abalone Symposium,"OCT 05-10, 2015OCT 05-10, 2015",,"Yeosu, SOUTH KOREAYeosu, SOUTH KOREA",11,0,0,0,11,0,11,,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,,,,,,,,,"Calif Dept Fish & Wildlife, 2099 Westshore Rd, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USAUniv Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, POB 247, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USANatl Marine Fisheries Serv, Fisheries Resources Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA",Calif Dept Fish & Wildlife,,,2016-11-23,WOS:000386496100004,,

Four seabreams were tagged and released, and their movements were recorded with automated and manual acoustic receivers. The spatial and temporal distribution of positional data suggest that the tagged seabreams hide inside the AR during the day, staying out of their shelter at night. The nocturnal movements of the tagged fishes are suggested to be a search for food in the seagrass patches surrounding the ARs. The monitored seabreams showed clear homing behaviour and strong site fidelity. Their home range extended from 0.01 to 0.17 km and included the AR and the surrounding sandy area with seagrass patches. Home range areas increased proportionally to the distance between the refuge on AR and the foraging areas on seagrass patches.

If floating cranes are used, the dynamic effects due to the floating crane motion should be considered while lifting the wreck. In this study, numerical analysis of wreck removal based on multibody system dynamics is performed when the wreck is lifted by two floating cranes with the same lifting capacity. The total lifting force of the floating cranes is calculated according to various ocean environmental conditions. Three kinds of seabed sediments are used to calculate different soil-resistant forces. Hydrodynamic forces from regular waves with several wave amplitudes, periods, and heading angles are applied to the floating cranes to understand the effect of each condition. In addition, irregular waves are also considered to analyze the total lifting force, which are more realistic cases in the ocean.

We compared the abundance of cetaceans between the Gully and the other parts of the Scotian Shelf and Slope and found that abundance was higher in the Gully. We also assessed cetacean distribution and relative abundance within the Gully relative to search effort for several effort for several apatial and temporal parameters: depth, slope, sea surface temperature, and month.

In the Davis Strait and Labrador Sea region rifting was initiated in the earliest Cretaceous and a number of basins formed. In time these basins deepened, although subsidence was interrupted by two main phases of uplift and erosion that took place in middle and late Cretaceous time, resulting in two hiatuses in the succession. Sediments with source or reservoir potential were deposited in the basins. Source rocks are known to occur in the marine Cretaceous successions of onshore northern Canada and central West Greenland and also offshore eastern Canada, and can therefore be expected to occur in the Lady Franklin and Maniitsoq basins.In the Lady Franklin area Paleocene volcanism associated with further tectonism caused the eruption of flood basalts and hyaloclastites on top of the Cretaceous mudstone and sandstone succession. A Lower Palaeogene sediment succession, which may contain both source and reservoir rocks, was then deposited on top of the basalts, as seen in the nearby Canadian Hekja O-71 well. Around the Ypresian to Lutetian transition a regression took place. The regression gave rise to an unconformity and a hiatus spanning a few million years throughout the entire West Greenland shelf. New deposition followed and, after a long period, major compression set in and a regression occurred across the whole shelf in Late Oligocene time. Erosion set in and was deep on the southern shelf, resulting in a hiatus spanning about 39 Ma. To the north the hiatus is only about 19 Ma.In early Middle Miocene time the tectonic regime in the Davis Strait area changed. Subsidence and deposition resumed offshore West Greenland. These events may have created conditions for generation of hydrocarbons in the potential source-rock sequences in the Cretaceous succession. Therefore, although hydrocarbon exploration has been limited in this region and had little success, it is thought that conditions are favourable for the discovery of significant oil and gas accumulations.",,,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,7,0,40,,,1354-0793,,,,,,,,,,,"Bur Min & Petr, DK-3900 Nuuk, Greenland, Denmark",Bur Min & Petr,,,2006-08-01,WOS:000240699800003,,

Benthic communities may, however, be affected by changes in current speeds resulting from arrays of tidal converters located in areas characterised by strong currents. Current speed, together with bottom type and depth, strongly influence benthic community distributions; however the interaction of these factors in controlling benthic dynamics in high energy environments is poorly understood. The Strangford Lough Narrows, the location of SeaGen, the world's first single full-scale, grid-compliant tidal energy extractor, is characterised by spatially heterogenous high current flows. A hydrodynamic model was used to select a range of benthic community study sites that had median flow velocities between 1.5-2.4 m/s in a depth range of 25-30 m. 25 sites were sampled for macrobenthic community structure using drop down video survey to test the sensitivity of the distribution of benthic communities to changes in the flow field. A diverse range of species were recorded which were consistent with those for high current flow environments and corresponding to very tide-swept faunal communities in the EUNIS classification. However, over the velocity range investigated, no changes in benthic communities were observed. This suggested that the high physical disturbance associated with the high current flows in the Strangford Narrows reflected the opportunistic nature of the benthic species present with individuals being continuously and randomly affected by turbulent forces and physical damage. It is concluded that during operation, the removal of energy by marine tidal energy arrays in the far-field is unlikely to have a significant effect on benthic communities in high flow environments.

Its analysis will demonstrate that South Korea’s existing environmental laws and existing international conventions to regulate offshore CCS activities can be used to draft a robust stand-alone legal framework appropriate for offshore CCS storage projects in South Korean waters.Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technology that could enable nations that emit greenhouse gases from their industrial activities to capture the emission before they reach the atmosphere and to place those greenhouse gases into deep geological storage. CCS re-purposes a pre-existing technology which injected carbon dioxide (CO2) into geological formations to enhance the production of crude oil from older fields; in those operations, it was discovered that most of the injected CO2 never returned to the surface, suggesting the potential to store CO2 in that manner. While some green scholars and activists oppose its implementation, many have seen CCS as a potential bridging technology to enable earlier reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining industrial output levels, until greener technological alternatives are mainstays of industrial economies. These carbon storage activities could be undertaken both onshore and offshore of the industrial economies.Because Korea has few suitable onshore storage locations for carbon storage, it will need to plan for offshore CCS operations. Legally, this could be fortuitous, as it would reduce the complexity of overlapping national and local administration issues and further could take inspiration from pre-existing international conventions on offshore CCS activities, such as under the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (“London Protocol”), the EU’s Directive on the Geological Storage of Carbon Dioxide (“the CCS Directive”), OSPAR Decision 2007/2 for the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (“OSPAR Convention”), and the Decision 10/CMP.7 of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This article evaluates these conventions comparatively with a variety of South Korean environmental enactments to find that if South Korea brought together its laws with key elements from those conventions, then South Korea could create and enact a leading model for offshore CCS storage projects.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1738-5903,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-06,KJD:ART002582475,,

However, by the time that the first census estimated a population of 4100 individuals in 1939/40, the species had already lost most of its habitat. A state-run conservation program in the former German Democratic Republic, gradually implemented after 1973, focused on two key aspects that are still valid today: 1. The rescue of clutches threatened by agricultural activities and the raising and release of the young bustards. The release of 949 such individuals (from 1973 to 2014) has prevented the species' extinction in Germany, even though habitat conditions have continued to deteriorate. 2. The establishment of protected areas with management guidelines for optimizing Great Bustard habitats. Around 1979, there were still about 1,000 individuals in 40 breeding communities spread over an area of 400,000 ha. By 1979, 25 sanctuaries had been established, including breeding centres, putting an area of 76,376 ha under legal protection. As main causes for the population decline, research has identified a high incidence of clutch and chick losses due to agricultural activities and losses of chicks through starvation due to a low arthropod density (because of large-scale monocultures and intensive use of biocides). The conservation guidelines have aimed to increase plant and animal species diversity through the establishment of permanent grasslands and restricting application of fertilizers as well as by leaving strips of fallow land on arable fields. Guidelines for timing farming activities so as to adapt to the life cycle of the Great Bustard have decreased losses of clutches and chicks. However, economic constraints and the programme's limited personnel and financial resources have led to conservation efforts being concentrated on the three localities, Havellandisches Luch, Belziger Landschaftswiesen and Fiener Bruch. In 1996/97, 56 individuals were still to be found there. Within these three areas, 20,000 ha are currently defined as a Special Protected Area (EU-SPA), and 10,114 ha are protected as nature reserve. These make up respectively 42% and 21 % of the key habitat. In spring 2015, the population was estimated at 197 individuals. Since 1991 the conservation programme has been financed mainly by the Environment Ministries of Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt, supported by the Great Bustard Association and its sponsors. Still attention is focused on the generation of a species-rich ground vegetation, as a precondition for a high arthropod density, and on long intervals between farming activities. Organic farming within the protected areas has a positive effect on ecological conditions, but, unfortunately, is poorly funded by the government compared to growing maize. Parcels of fallow land with naturally developing vegetation and sown flower strips are used to provide both a good food supply and refuges from disturbance. Long-term monitoring of the efficiency of the land management demonstrates that the conservation of the Great Bustard supports a complex increase of plant and animal biodiversity. Support programmes of the European Union compensate farmers for loss of income. Since 1990 clutch and chick losses have risen dramatically owing to a massive population growth of Red Fox, Raccoon Dog, and Raccoon. The reduction of predator density has been a precondition for the survival of the Great Bustard for the last 20 years. This is achieved in close cooperation with local hunters. Other predators are corvids, which cause a high number of clutch losses in spring, and the resident sea eagles, which prey on both immature and adult birds. A current focus of the conservation project is the analysis of home range use with the help of individual-specific markings, including radio transmitters. A solid data base is crucial in conflicts over the continuing degradation of the Great Bustard's habitat (e.g. due to road construction, wind farms, and the increase of maize cultivation).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0941-0627,,,,,,,,,,,"Dorfstr 14, Nennhausen, D-14715, Germany",,,,2016-03-03,ZOOREC:ZOOR15203020062,,

Three main routes through which behaviour might be altered are discussed; elevated metabolic load, 'info-disruption' and avoidance behaviour away from polluted locations. There is clear experimental evidence that exposure to high CO2 disrupts the ability to find settlement sites and shelters, the ability to detect predators and the ability to detect prey and food. In marine vertebrates and marine crustaceans behavioural change appears to occur via info-disruption. In hermit crabs and other crustaceans impairment of performance capacities might also play a role. We discuss the implications for such behavioural changes in terms of potential impacts at the levels of population health and ecosystem services, and consider future directions for research.

The seabed photographs were captured using a GRAS-14S5M-C camera with a Tamron TAM 23FM08-L lens mounted to the Gavia autonomous underwater vehicle. The camera captured photographs at a temporal frequency of 1.875 frames per second, a resolution of 1280 x 960 pixels, and at a target altitude of 2 m above the seafloor. Overlapping photos were removed. Megafaunal specimens (>1 cm) in the non-overlapping images were detected using the MAIA machine learning algorithm in BIIGLE. The potential specimens detected using this method were reviewed to remove false positives and classified into morphotypes manually.

There are relatively few bioherms (i.e., coral-built mounds) in the northern GOM, and most DSCs are attached to existing hard substrata (e.g., authigenically formed carbonate). The primary structure-forming, DSC in the GOM is Lophelia pertusa, but structure is also provided by other living and dead scleractinians, antipatharians (black corals), octocorals (gorgonians, soft corals), hydrocorals and sponges, as well as abundant rocky substrata. The best development of DSCs in the GOM was previously documented within Viosca Knoll oil and gas lease blocks 826 and 862/906 (north-central GOM) and on the Campeche Bank (southern GOM in Mexican waters). This paper documents extensive deer; reef ecosystems composed of DSC and rocky hard-bottom recently surveyed on the West Florida Slope (WFS, eastern GOM) during six research cruises (2008-2012). Using multibeam sonar, CTD casts, and video from underwater vehicles, we describe the physical and oceanographic characteristics of these deep reefs and provide size or area estimates of deep coral and hardground habitats. The multibeam sonar analyses revealed hundreds of mounds and ridges, some of which were subsequently surveyed using underwater vehicles. Mounds and ridges in < 525 m depths were usually capped with living coral colonies, dominated by L. pertusa. An extensive rocky scarp, running roughly north-south for at least 229 km, supported lower abundances of scleractinian corals than the mounds and ridges, despite an abundance of settlement substrata. Areal comparisons suggested that the WFS may exceed other parts of the GOM slope in extent of living deep coral coverage and other deep-reef habitat (dead coral and rock). The complex WFS region warrants additional studies to better understand the influences of oceanography and geology on the occurrence of DSC and associated organisms. Protection measures are being considered to ensure the long-term integrity of this diverse ecosystem.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,0,7,,,0967-0637,1879-0119,,,,,,,,,,"Univ North Carolina Wilmington, Ctr Marine Sci, 5600 Marvin Moss Ln, Wilmington, NC 28409 USAFlorida State Univ, Coastal & Marine Lab, 3618 Coastal Hwy 98, St Teresa, FL 32358 USA",,,,2017-03-29,WOS:000394404100002,,

Located off the Northwestern Pacific margin, covering 4700000 km(2) from tropical to northern temperate zones, and including a variety of continental margins/basins and depths, the China Seas provide typical cases for carbon budget studies. The South China Sea being a deep basin and part of the Western Pacific Warm Pool is characterized by oceanic features; the East China Sea with a wide continental shelf, enormous terrestrial discharges and open margins to the West Pacific, is featured by strong cross-shelf materials transport; the Yellow Sea is featured by the confluence of cold and warm waters; and the Bohai Sea is a shallow semi-closed gulf with strong impacts of human activities. Three large rivers, the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Pearl River, flow into the East China Sea, the Bohai Sea, and the South China Sea, respectively. The Kuroshio Current at the outer margin of the Chinese continental shelf is one of the two major western boundary currents of the world oceans and its strength and position directly affect the regional climate of China. These characteristics make the China Seas a typical case of marginal seas to study carbon storage and fluxes. This paper systematically analyzes the literature data on the carbon pools and fluxes of the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea, including different interfaces (land-sea, sea-air, sediment-water, and marginal sea-open ocean) and different ecosystems (mangroves, wetland, seagrass beds, macroalgae mariculture, coral reefs, euphotic zones, and water column). Among the four seas, the Bohai Sea and South China Sea are acting as CO2 sources, releasing about 0.22 and 13.86-33.60 Tg C yr(-1) into the atmosphere, respectively, whereas the Yellow Sea and East China Sea are acting as carbon sinks, absorbing about 1.15 and 6.92-23.30 Tg C yr(-1) of atmospheric CO2, respectively. Overall, if only the CO2 exchange at the sea-air interface is considered, the Chinese marginal seas appear to be a source of atmospheric CO2, with a net release of 6.01-9.33 Tg C yr(-1), mainly from the inputs of rivers and adjacent oceans. The riverine dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) input into the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea are 5.04, 14.60, and 40.14 Tg C yr(-1), respectively. The DIC input from adjacent oceans is as high as 144.81 Tg C yr(-1), significantly exceeding the carbon released from the seas to the atmosphere. In terms of output, the depositional fluxes of organic carbon in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea are 2.00, 3.60, 7.40, and 5.92 Tg C yr(-1), respectively. The fluxes of organic carbon from the East China Sea and South China Sea to the adjacent oceans are 15.25-36.70 and 43.93 Tg C yr(-1), respectively. The annual carbon storage of mangroves, wetlands, and seagrass in Chinese coastal waters is 0.36-1.75 Tg C yr(-1), with a dissolved organic carbon (DOC) output from seagrass beds of up to 0.59 Tg C yr(-1). Removable organic carbon flux by Chinese macroalgae mariculture account for 0.68 Tg C yr(-1) and the associated POC depositional and DOC releasing fluxes are 0.14 and 0.82 Tg C yr(-1), respectively. Thus, in total, the annual output of organic carbon, which is mainly DOC, in the China Seas is 81.72-104.56 Tg C yr(-1).The DOC efflux from the East China Sea to the adjacent oceans is 15.00-35.00 Tg C yr(-1). The DOC efflux from the South China Sea is 31.39 Tg C yr(-1). Although the marginal China Seas seem to be a source of atmospheric CO2 based on the CO2 flux at the sea-air interface, the combined effects of the riverine input in the area, oceanic input, depositional export, and microbial carbon pump (DOC conversion and output) indicate that the China Seas represent an important carbon storage area.",,,,,,,,,44,15,0,0,23,0,55,,,1674-7313,1869-1897,,,,,,,,,,"Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen 361101, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Qingdao Inst Bioenergy & Bioproc Technol, Key Lab Biofuels, Shandong Prov Key Lab Energy Genet, Qingdao 266101, Peoples R ChinaShandong Univ, Inst Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266273, Peoples R ChinaOcean Univ China, Key Lab Marine Chem Theory & Technol, Minist Educ, Qingdao Collaborat Innovat Ctr Marine Sci & Techn, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R ChinaTsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, Guangzhou 510301, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaState Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 1, Key Lab Marine Sedimentol & Environm Geol, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China",State Ocean Adm,,,2018-11-01,WOS:000449781200001,,

This study is aimed to compare the sensitivity of embryo-larval development of two species of sea urchins (Paracentrutos lividus and Lytechinus variegatus) collected and exposed to samples from different coastal zone (Spain and Brazil) to ocean acidification. The results showed that the larval stages are very sensitive to small changes in the seawater's pH. The larvae from P. lividus species showed to be more sensitive to acidified elutriate sediments than larvae from L variegatus sea urchin. Furthermore, this study has demonstrated that the CO2 enrichment in aquatic ecosystems cause changes on the mobility of the metals: Zn, Cu, Fe, Al and As, which was presented different behavior among them. Although an increase on the mobility of metals was found, the results using the principal component analysis showed that the pH reduction show the highest correlations with the toxicity and is the main cause of embryo-larval development inhibition. In this comparative study it is demonstrated that both species are able to assess potential effects of the ocean acidification related to CO2 enrichment by both near future scenarios and the risk associated with CO2 leakages in the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) process, and the importance of comparative studies in different zones to improve the understanding of the impacts caused by ocean acidification.

The plates placed in October, December and February showed coverage of approximately 30%. Every plate, except those placed in August, was dominated by Sargassum spp. within one year, but the time required for Sargassum domination was shorter on the plates placed in winter than in the other seasons.

Yet with limited funds for conservation of threatened species and ecosystems there is a desire to identify priority areas where investment efficiently conserves multiple ecosystem services. We mapped four mangrove ecosystems services (coastal protection, fisheries, biodiversity, and carbon storage) across Fiji. Using a cost-effectiveness analysis, we prioritised mangrove areas for each service, where the effectiveness was a function of the benefits provided to the local communities, and the costs were associated with restricting specific uses of mangroves. We demonstrate that, although priority mangrove areas (top 20%) for each service can be managed at relatively low opportunity costs (ranging from 4.5 to 11.3% of overall opportunity costs), prioritising for a single service yields relatively low co-benefits due to limited geographical overlap with priority areas for other services. None-the-less, prioritisation of mangrove areas provides greater overlap of benefits than if sites were selected randomly for most ecosystem services. We discuss deficiencies in the mapping of ecosystems services in data poor regions and how this may impact upon the equity of managing mangroves for particular services across the urban-rural divide in developing countries. Finally we discuss how our maps may aid decision-makers to direct funding for mangrove management from various sources to localities that best meet funding objectives, as well as how this knowledge can aid in creating a national mangrove zoning scheme.",,,,,,,,,38,1,0,0,21,0,41,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaWildlife Conservat Soc, Melanesia Program, Suva, FijiWildlife Conservat Soc, Global Conservat Program, New York, NY USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, NCEAS, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",Wildlife Conservat Soc,,,2016-03-23,WOS:000372701200084,27008421,

Through these researches, various information has been acquired on fishery ecology of flounder including their biological characteristics (Kato 1986), population dynamics and life history (Kato 1985). In the area of Iwafune, flounder and dabs have been caught with a small scale otter trawl, Itabikiami. Due to the small mesh size in the cod end (51 mm) of the fishing gear, a large number of juvenile flounders have been wasted. In addition to this irrational catch, overfishing of young flounders every year decreased the annual catch in 1987 to 207 metric ton, which is less than half of the 1975-1985 catch levels. As a result of the sharp reduction in 1987, intense researches have been conducted especially with the implementation of three strategies: execution of a fisheries management program, appropriate release of reared juveniles, and realization of a nature preserve by the settlement of artificial reefs. Two important keys have been found at present study to promote stock enhancement of Japanese flounder. The primary finding is a possibility to predict the number of recruits. The relation of strong regression between the density of settled juveniles and number of recruits has become possible to predict the number of one year flounders. Therefore, this prediction can minimize overfishing and determine the optimal catch level. The other step is to improve their survival rate higher. We have to make some propositions for this purpose such as increasing mesh size of the cod end to 83 mm, establishing regulations to protect the area and to decrease catch rate, and correspondent release with the appropriate level of recruits.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0389-5858,,,,,,,,,,,"Niigata Prefectural Fisheries Experimental Stn. 13098-8 Igarashi Sannocho, Niigata 950-21, Japan",,,,1996-01-01,BCI:BCI199699101067,,

This influence could be substantial for abundant bioturbating benthic animals like the ghost shrimp Lepidophthalmus louisianensis. An assessment of the influence of these ghost shrimp on petroleum hydrocarbons was conducted in laboratory micro- and mesocosms containing coastal Gulf of Mexico sediment, seawater, and oil or the polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pyrene. In an experiment with pyrene added to the water column, the ghost shrimp presence lowered water-column pyrene concentrations. In an experiment with oil added to the sediment surface, the ghost shrimp presence decreased PAH concentrations in the sediment surface layer but increased these in the water column and subsurface sediment. A companion study and a mass-balance analysis indicated a net loss of PAHs through an enhancement of microbial degradation. In an experiment in which oil was added as a narrow subsurface layer in the sediment, the ghost shrimp presence appeared to broaden the oil's depth distribution. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ghost shrimp can significantly influence the biodegradation and distribution of spilled oil in coastal ecosystems. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-11.

We focused on eelgrass beds with low anthropogenic impacts to compare natural differences. In addition, we analyzed the relationships of eelgrass bed structure with environmental conditions, and species composition with bed structure and environmental conditions, to elucidate potential drivers of observed differences. Our results indicate that regional differences in eelgrass bed structure were weakly correlated with water column properties, whereas differences in carbon and nitrogen storage were mainly driven by differences in eelgrass biomass.

Risk assessment procedures for oil-related compounds (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]) should address differences in exposure between Arctic and temperate benthos. We compare for the first time the bioaccumulation of PAHs by Arctic benthic invertebrate species with that of temperate species, based on their biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs). Measured PAH BSAFs were generally higher in temperate bivalves (Limecola balthica) than in Arctic bivalves (Macoma calcarea), whereas BSAFs in Arctic polychaetes (Nephtys ciliata) were higher than in temperate polychaetes (Alitta virens). Differences in measured BSAFs were explained by species-specific feeding modes and traits. However, modeled BSAFs revealed that steady state was not likely to be reached in the 28-d tests for all PAHs and organisms. Due to the low numbers of individuals, most species-specific parameters were too uncertain to reveal differences between Arctic and temperate species. The results of the present study suggest that data from temperate species could be used as a surrogate for Arctic species in risk assessment. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:883-895.

A curious phenomenon reflecting ecological self-organization around reef habitat structures exists on coral reefs: large-scale (hundreds to hundreds of thousands of m 2 ) halo-like patterns surrounding patch reefs, i.e., individual coral reefs that are often separated by seagrass or macroalgal meadows. These halos, long known to occur in various locations worldwide, reflect a distinct band of unvegetated sediments surrounding coral patch reefs. However, the full suite of mechanisms controlling them have never been rigorously explored, perhaps due to the common assumption dating back nearly 50 years that they arise solely from reef-based herbivory patterns shaped by anti-predator behavior. Here we provide empirical evidence from a set of halos within Australia's Great Barrier Reef that risk-averse foraging and a previously unrecognized functional group contribute to halo formation, demonstrating that these halos cannot be explained by any one mechanism in isolation. Our results show that halos are a more complex ecological phenomenon than previously assumed by the majority of studies of halos. Specifically, risk-averse grazing by herbivores is likely a key mechanism behind the formation of halos, as generally assumed, but bioturbators also play a central role. This knowledge furthers our understanding of how small-scale species interactions can structure habitat at landscape scales. These large-scale habitat features are important because they affect at least one important ecosystem function, carbon storage, and potentially others (e.g., biological nutrient transfer). These results also raise the question of whether other self-organized ecological patterns may be more nuanced than is currently assumed. This study capitalizes on recent advances in high resolution satellite imagery accessibility that allow ecologists to measure landscape-scale habitat features nearly everywhere on land and in shallow seas. Our results suggest that halos may hold potential as the basis for a tool for remotely observing ecological interactions and measuring large-scale ecosystem change on coral reefs.

On the basis of four experimental bottom stations installed at various depths of the North Caspian shelf, the local communities of marine organisms were formed, on various constructions and in close proximity to them were investigated. The aim of the work is to study the features of community development on the basis of bottom biological stations, to measure their quantitative characteristics, to assess the informative character of the structural and functional characteristics of local communities for analyzing the state of the marine environment. Methods. Experimental bottom stations were installed in various regions of the North Caspian shelf using diving equipment to study their impact on the environment. Control over the development of associated fauna was carried out with the help of traps and the method of direct accounting for the materials of photo-video surveys. Sampling of fouling was carried out by the method of registration sites. Based on the number of species of flora and fauna of local communities, a ballroom information system has been suggested, that can be used for monitoring. Results. Research materials indicate a significant difference in the species composition, biomass and the structure of communities of local cenoses formed at the bottom stations with the same design and ecological capacity at various depths of the North Caspian shelf. In the shallow shelf zone at depths of 6-8 m in the local community of the bottom station, the vegetation component is dominant. At great depths, the total biomass increases in local cenoses and animal communities, including filter-feeders, make significant contribution to the self-purification of the marine environment. Conclusions. The results indicate the possibility of using complex observations of the structure and functional characteristics of local communities formed on the base of bottom stations, as well as the development of species of indicators and objects of accumulation of toxicants for assessing the state of the marine environment. The development of this approach involves the experiments with different station costructioons and materials and use of biotechnology implantation of test organisms on the design of bottom stations.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1992-1098,2413-0958,,,,,,,,,,"RAS, Inst Oceanol, Moscow, RussiaRAS, Inst Oceanol, Lab Geodynam Georesources & Geoecol, Fed Publicly Funded Inst Sci, Moscow, RussiaDagestan State Univ, Dept Recreat Geog & Sustainable Dev, Inst Ecol & Sustainable Dev, Makhachkala, RussiaRussian Acad Sci, Caspian Branch, Fed Publicly Funded Inst Sci, Inst Oceanol, Savushkina St,6 Bldg 27, Astrakhan 414056, Russia",,,,2019-03-07,WOS:000459110100002,,

Here, we combine natural abundance stable isotope tracers and survey data to show that mid-water and bentho-pelagic-feeding demersal fishes play an important role in the ocean carbon cycle, bypassing the detrital particle flux and transferring carbon to deep long-term storage. Global peaks in biomass and diversity of fishes at mid-slope depths are explained by competitive release of the demersal fish predators of mid-water organisms, which in turn support benthic fish production. Over 50% of the biomass of the demersal fish community at depths between 500 and 1800 m is supported by biological rather than detrital nutrient flux processes, and we estimate that bentho-pelagic fishes from the UK-Irish continental slope capture and store a volume of carbon equivalent to over 1 million tonnes of CO2 every year.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,18,0,26,,,,1471-2954,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, University of Southampton Waterfront Campus, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, UK trueman@noc.soton.ac.uk.Marine Institute, Rinville, Oranmore, Co.

Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) offer a robust survey tool for quantifying these pressures and tracking the success of management intervention while at a range of depths, including those inaccessible to most SCUBA diver-based survey methods (similar to>30 m). As the strengths, limitations, and biases of ROVs for visually monitoring fish assemblages remain unclear, this review aims to evaluate ROVs as a survey technique and to suggest optimal sampling strategies for use in typical ROV-based studies. Using the search engines Scopus (TM) and Google Scholar (TM), 119 publications were identified that used ROVs for visual surveys of fish assemblages. While the sampling strategies and sampling metrics used to annotate the imagery in these publications varied considerably, the total abundance of fish recorded over strip transects of varying dimensions was the most common sampling design. The choice of ROV system appears to be a strong indicator of both the types of surveys available to studies and the success of ROV deployments. For instance, larger, more powerful working-class systems can complete longer and more complex designs (e.g., swath, cloverleaf, and polygonal transects) at greater depths, whereas observation-class systems are less expensive and easier to deploy, but are more susceptible to delays or cancelations of deployments. In more severe sea state conditions, radial transects, or strip transects that employ live-boating or a weight to anchor the tether to the seafloor, can be used to improve the performance of observation-class systems. As these systems often employ shorter tethers, radial transects can also be used to maximize sampling area at greater depths and on large vessels that may rotate substantially while anchored. For highly mobile species, and in survey designs where individuals are likely to be recounted (e.g., transects along oil and gas pipelines), relative abundance (MaxN) may be a more robust sampling metric. By identifying subtle, yet important, differences in the application of ROVs as a tool for visually surveying deep-water marine ecosystems, we identified key areas for improvement for best practice for future studies.",,,,,,,,,55,1,0,0,40,0,56,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tasmania, Coll Sci & Engn, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia",,,,2019-04-12,WOS:000463166600001,,

L. pertusa was positively identified on 13 of 14 platforms examined using existing oil and gas industry visual inspections. Two platforms were inspected in more detail to examine depth and colony size distributions. We recorded 947 colonies occurring between 59 and 132 in depth that coincides with cold Atlantic water at depths below the summer thermocline in the northern North Sea. We suggest that these colonies provide evidence for a planktonic larval stage of L. pertusa with recruits initially originating from populations in the north-east Atlantic and now self recruiting to the platforms. Size class distribution showed a continuous range of size classes, but with few outlying large colonies. The break between the largest colonies and the rest of the population is considered as the point when colonies began self recruiting to the platforms, resulting in greater colonization success. We present the first documented in situ colony growth rate estimate (26 +/- 5 mm yr(-1)) for L. pertusa based on 15 colonies from the Tern Alpha platform with evidence for yearly recruitment events starting the year the platform was installed.

Yet, nutrient supply from consumers may be a regulating factor when consumers aggregate, such as fishes around structurally complex habitat. Examining this bottom-up mechanistic pathway is essential for a more holistic understanding of seagrass ecosystems, which are important and threatened globally. This study will address the following questions: (1) Does concentrated nutrient supply from consumers result in distinct biogeochemical hot spots in seagrass beds? and (2) How do consumer effects on ecosystem processes vary across regional environmental contexts where nutrient availability and fishing pressure vary? The PIs will conduct experiments at multiple sites within three biogeographic regions in the Caribbean (The Bahamas, Hispaniola, and Grenada/St.Vincent/Grenadines). The experiments will utilize artificial reefs that mimic natural patch reef habitats that concentrate animals at high densities. Response variables reflecting ecosystem processes (e.g., seagrass nutrient content, seagrass biomass, primary producer diversity) will be measured at reef sites and compared with control sites (seagrass sites without reefs). The spatial extent over which ecosystem processes may be affected, i.e., distance from artificial reef, will be quantified and used to detect ecological thresholds in ecosystem responses. Predictor variables, including measures of ambient nutrient availability, fish densities and fish grazing rates, will be used to contextualize the relative importance of consumer-mediated nutrient supply. The hierarchical experimental design and two-pronged analysis will characterize relationships across environmental gradients found among and within the biogeographic regions, facilitating a conceptual framework needed to predict when, where, and why consumer-mediated nutrient supply is an important control of ecosystems processes in seagrass beds. Broader Impacts: The project is designed to maximize broader impacts at regional, national, and local levels through extensive integration of research and education efforts. The entire program is designed in partnership with The Nature Conservancy, for which the PI serves on the Caribbean Advisory Board. The Nature Conservancy is at the forefront of the Caribbean Challenge, an effort to protect 20% of marine habitats by the year 2020. All of the planned study sites are part of current, or proposed, marine protected areas as part of the Caribbean Challenge initiative. Data from the research will inform monitoring plans, management strategies, and prioritization of conservation measures. Outreach initiatives at local and national levels will be designed with sensitivity to local environmental and social opportunities and challenges. For example, in The Bahamas, the PI will help design and develop a new center on Abaco Island intended to support research, education and conservation activities: ACRE (the Abaco Conservation, Research & Education Center). The outreach website The Abaco Scientist will be expanded, continuing to provide a platform for quick dissemination of information to the general public.

In this study, the effects of elevated seawater temperature and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) on subtropical sediment systems of mangrove, seagrass, and coral reef lagoon habitats of Okinawa, Japan, were examined. Sediment and seawater from each habitat were exposed to four pCO(2)-temperature treatments, including ambient pCO(2)- ambient temperature, ambient pCO(2)-high temperature (ambient temperature + 4 degrees C), high pCO(2) (936 ppm)-ambient temperature, and high pCO(2)-high temperature. Parameters including primary production, nutrient flux, pigment content, photosynthetic community composition, and bacterial abundance were examined. Neither high temperature nor high pCO(2) alone impacted mangrove and seagrass sediment primary production significantly (Tukey's test, P > 0.05). However, the combined stress significantly (Tukey's test, P < 0.01) increased primary production in these two habitats. In sediments from the coral reef lagoon, single and combined stress treatments induced a shift from heterotrophy to autotrophy. Significant increases in net primary production (Tukey's test, P < 0.01), and gross primary production (Tukey's test, P < 0.05) under the combined stress suggested that benthic microalgae in mangrove and seagrass sediments were more responsive to high temperature and pCO(2) conditions than those in coral reef lagoon sediments. Additionally, combined stress significantly increased the sediment chlorophyll a content (Tukey's test, P < 0.05) in all habitats. These increases were associated with increased net primary production, indicating that combined stress stimulates primary production activity by the photosynthetic benthic microalgae in all habitats. Diatom activity increased, as silicate uptake increased in all habitats. Microbial abundance significantly increased under the combined stress treatment (Tukey's test, P < 0.01), but did not exceed autotrophic activity.

Determining changes in these processes following disturbance is crucial in assessing the wider impacts on ecosystem function and ultimately ecosystem services. Whilst the focus is often on whether disturbance drives changes in ecosystem function through mortality, sub-lethal effects on the physio logy and behaviour of organisms may also have cascading effects on ecosystem processes, functions and services. In this mesocosm study, we investigated the effects of a severe short-term exposure (8 d) to a simulated environmental impact - a leak of a subsea geological CO2 capture and storage reservoir - on key biological processes (bioturbation), an ecosystem function (nutrient cycling) and on the functional group composition for 7 common benthic invertebrate species. We statistically allocated species to functional effect groups based on their measured functional effect relative to other species. Following exposure, we observed behavioural responses driving changes in bioturbation for several species and altered nutrient cycling. Responses were species specific and resulted in shifts in functional effect group composition for some key nutrients (nitrate and silicate). We show that the allocation of species to functional groups by measuring specified ecosystem processes and functions can change following environmental perturbations. This implies that whilst biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are intricately linked, maintaining species identities and abundances after environmental perturbation is no guarantee to maintaining ecosystem functions, as species alter their rate and mode of activity following an environ mental stress.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Zool Bldg,Tillydrone Ave, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, ScotlandPlymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, EnglandUniv Edinburgh, Grant Inst, Sch Geosci, Kings Bldg,James Hutton Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FE, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2018-01-01,WOS:000418268200003,,

Seagrass meadows, characterized by high primary productivity, efficient water column filtration and sediment stability, have a pronounced capacity for carbon sequestration. This is enhanced by low decomposition rates in anaerobic seagrass sediments. The carbon captured by seagrass meadows contributes significantly to the total blue carbon. At a global scale, seagrass ecosystems are carbon sink hot spots and have profound influences on the global carbon cycle. This importance combined with the many other functions of seagrass meadows places them among the most valuable ecosystems in the world. Unfortunately, seagrasses are declining globally at an alarming rate owing to anthropogenic disturbances and climate change, making them also among the most threatened ecosystems on the Earth. The role of coastal systems in carbon sequestration has received far too little attention and thus there are still many uncertainties in evaluating carbon sequestration of global seagrass meadows accurately. To better assess the carbon sequestration of global seagrass ecosystems, a number of scientific issues should be considered with high priorities: 1) more accurate measurements of seagrass coverage at national and global levels; 2) more comprehensive research into species- and location-specific carbon sequestration efficiencies; 3) in-depth exploration of the effects of human disturbance and global climate change on carbon capture and storage by seagrass ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,4,20,0,0,4,0,22,,,1001-9332,1001-9332,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Urban and Reg Ecol, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China",,,,2014-09-13,BCI:BCI201400637595,25223044,

Some temporal trends in contaminants of relevance to the Gully MPA have been detected. For example, decreasing trends in PCB and DDT concentrations have been observed in Sable Island seals, which may spend some of their time in the Gully. However, samples from northern bottlenose whales that spend much of their time in the Gully indicated an increase in 4,4'-DDE and trans-nonachlor from 1996 to 2003. Decreasing trends in dissolved lead and zinc are evident across the Eastern Scotian Shelf, and large floating debris appears to have decreased over time in the Gully. However, no decreasing trend was seen in dissolved copper or smaller plastic debris. Dissolved metals measured in the Gully MPA are similar to these measured elsewhere on the Scotian Shelf. Chromium, copper, iron, vanadium and zinc in sediments of the Gully area show patterns that are indicative of natural concentrations. A small subset of samples has shown elevated levels of barium and lead. Aromatic hydrocarbons were not detected in sediment samples collected from feeder canyons to the Gully MPA in 2006, but the samples did contain total alkanes (C10-C35) at low concentrations. The source of these alkanes is unknown, though observations based on the analysis of individual alkanes suggests both biogenic and anthropogenic sources are possible. A small sample of Gully krill contained pristane but no other detectable alkanes and very low concentrations of alkylated and parental PAHs. Measurements of CYP1A1 protein expression in northern bottlenose whales indicated increased levels in 2003, which may be an indication of exposure to hydrocarbon contamination. Higher concentrations of a number of organochlorine compounds were observed in northern bottlenose whales from the Gully than in a population from the northern Labrador Shelf. Future contaminant monitoring within the Gully ecosystem should include: continuation of existing time series to establish long-term temporal trends, expanded sampling and analysis of Gully sediments to establish spatial patterns, and opportunistic sampling/analysis of relevant indicator species to determine contaminant levels and investigate potential biological effects. This monitoring should be conducted in conjunction with targeted research to better understand the ecosystem dynamics of the Gully, including geological and oceanographic processes. Potential indicator species for monitoring of contaminants and their biological effects in the Gully include flounder, snow crab, squid, krill/shrimp, corals and bottlenose whales. However, additional research is required to determine the feasibility of using any of these species for contaminant monitoring in the MPA and the potential usefulness of the results for management. There are a number of sources of uncertainty to be taken into account when considering the recommendations provided within this report. Only a small number of water, sediment and biota samples have been collected from the Gully MPA, and only a very limited analysis of the dynamics of the system has been conducted to date. Given the limited amount of sitespecific data, observations made elsewhere on the Scotian Shelf have been used to provide context for the Gully MPA.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14602014639,,

The water column is approximated by three layers. The top layer is uniformly mixed by wind stirring and the bottom by tidal energy, while linear gradients can occur in the middle layer. The model is forced with hourly meteorological data and mean tidal energies. Primary production is represented by a model with a single nutrient and a single phytoplankton population. The results from the model show good agreement with data collected on a Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) cruise in May 1992 and with historical data. When advection is included, driven by depth-averaged currents, the surface temperature patterns are improved but bottom temperatures in deep water are raised and high concentrations of chlorophyll are carried offshore from coastal regions. This indicates a limitation of using depth-averaged currents and a need to account for differences in phytoplankton species composition in coastal and offshore waters. Calculations demonstrate the importance of salinity variations to stratification and phytoplankton growth. Smoothing the wind mixing energy has the effect of delaying the onset of the spring bloom in areas where wind mixing is significant. Removing the diurnal cycle of solar heating also delays the spring bloom.

The proximity of coastal habitats to runoff and disturbance creates ideal conditions for microbial priming, i.e., the enhanced remineralisation of stored carbon in response to fresh substrate availability and oxygen introduction. Microbial priming, therefore, poses a risk for enhanced CO2 release in these carbon sequestration hotspots. Herewe quantified the existence of priming in seagrass sediments and showed that the addition of fresh carbon stimulated a 1.7- to 2.7-fold increase in CO2 release from recent and accumulated carbon deposits. Wepropose that priming taking place at the sediment surface is a natural occurrence and can be minimised by the recalcitrant components of the fresh inputs (i.e., lignocellulose) and by reduced metabolism in lowoxygen and high burial rate conditions. Conversely, priming of deep sediments after the reintroduction to thewater columnthrough physical disturbances (e.g., dredging, boat scars) would cause rapid remineralisation of previously preserved carbon. Microbial priming is identified as a process that weakens sediment carbon storage capacity and is a pathway to CO2 release in disturbed or degraded seagrass ecosystems; however, increased management and restoration practices can reduce these anthropogenic disturbances and enhance carbon sequestration capacity.

In order to further study seep ecosystems on the Brazilian margin, a deep-sea investigation named Iauf-Puma cruise was conducted using the human-occupied vehicle Shinkai 6500 off Brazil's southeast continental margin. Asphalt seeps were discovered on the seafloor of the North sao Paulo Plateau from depths of 2652-2752 m, representing only the third discovery of this type of seep worldwide, following those in the Gulf of Mexico and off Angola. Video and isotopic analyses indicated a number of megabenthic animals in the asphalt seeps in the North Sao Paulo Plateau and revealed typical deep-sea heterotrophic and photosynthesis based fauna occupying hard substrates provided by the asphalt seep. There was no evidence of chemosynthesis-based megabenthic fauna such as vesicomyid clams, Bathymodiolus mussels, and siboglinid tube worms, or any sediment bacterial mats, gas seepage, and carbonate rock in/around the seeps.

However, as industry moves towards using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), it is important to understand how such a change may affect assessments of fish assemblages and whether these data collected from AUVs can be directly compared to those collected from historic and future ROV footage. In an extremely rare opportunity, we compare fish assemblages surveyed by an industrial ROV and an industrial hybrid-AUV (H-AUV) along the same 2,060-m section of subsea pipeline, at the same time of day, within 1 day of each other. A total of 206 transects, each 20 m in length, were analyzed, recording 406 fish from 10 species. The H-AUV recorded all 10 fish species, while the ROV recorded seven. Mean species richness was similar to 4% higher for H-AUV, and mean abundance was similar to 21% higher for ROV; these differences can be considered negligible. Multivariate analysis revealed nonsignificant differences in species composition between survey methods. This result suggests that future surveys of fish at this pipeline using a similar H-AUV can yield comparable results to ROV and, as such, facilitate comparison to historical ROV imagery. Future surveys of pipelines with AUV should consider adding extra lighting and high-definition cameras onto booms similar to those operating on ROVs, which will provide a useful field of view into pipeline spans and make it easier to identify fish.

We used a fixed-effect model to calculate the absolute value of the mean effect size of each driver by age class studied and pooled across age classes to estimate effects on the overall abundance of red snapper. Habitat complexity and intra-specific competition had large effects on overall abundance and juvenile abundance, while habitat type and protection from predators showed medium to large effects on age 0 recruits and juvenile red snapper, and the mean effect of all drivers studied for adult red snapper were small or had no effect on abundance. Our results provide systematic support for the role of density-dependent mechanisms (habitat quality and availability, competition, predation) in shaping the regional abundance of red snapper, particularly during the juvenile stages. Sensitivity analyses indicated that issues with non-independence (e.g. within-article correlation), between-study heterogeneity, and publication bias influenced the magnitude and certainty of effect size estimates in a subset of drivers. Thus, our meta-analytical review also highlights the need for more empirical research on certain drivers (e.g. temperature, hypoxia) to improve our understanding of the factors that shape the regional abundance of red snapper.",,,,,,,,,7,1,0,0,6,0,8,,,0960-3166,1573-5184,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USAUniv S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USAUniv Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv Southern Mississippi, Gulf Coast Res Lab, Ocean Springs, MS 39564 USAOcean Conservancy, Gulf Restorat Program, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USACouncil Watershed Hlth, Pasadena, CA 91105 USAGeorge Mason Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USAJackson State Univ, Jackson, MS 39217 USAAuburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USASan Diego State Univ Imperial Valley, Calexico, CA 92231 USAUniv Cent Florida, UCF Marine Turtle Res Grp, Dept Biol, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",Ocean ConservancyCouncil Watershed Hlth,,,2020-07-01,WOS:000541216500001,,

These coastal ecosystems are also susceptible to the impacts of climate change and rising sea levels, with evidence of global shifts in the distribution of mangroves, including encroachment into salt marshes. The encroachment of woody mangrove shrubs and trees into herbaceous salt marshes may represent a substantial change in ecosystem structure, although resulting impacts on ecosystem functions and service provisions are largely unknown. In this review, we assess changes in ecosystem services associated with mangrove encroachment. While there is quantitative evidence to suggest that mangrove encroachment may enhance carbon storage and the capacity of a wetland to increase surface elevation in response to sea-level rise, for most services there has been no direct assessment of encroachment impact. On the basis of current understanding of ecosystem structure and function, we theorize that mangrove encroachment may increase nutrient storage and improve storm protection, but cause declines in habitat availability for fauna requiring open vegetation structure (such as migratory birds and foraging bats) as well as the recreational and cultural activities associated with this fauna (e.g., bird-watching and/or hunting). Changes to provisional services such as fisheries productivity and cultural services are likely to be site specific and dependent on the species involved.

Although cause and effect could not be unequivocally established, the theoretical basis of hearing in pinnipeds and previous studies suggested that extreme noise (to 257 dB re 1 mu Pa-pp @ 1 m) generated by pile-driving of turbine bases led to displacement of seals. A lack of full recovery of harbour seal during the study was also linked to their sensitivity to vessel activity and/or rapid colonisation of competing grey seal.

The recent appearance of an invasive ecosystem engineer, the ascidian Pyura doppelgangera, at the very northern tip of New Zealand now threatens to exclude these bivalves from this habitat. Here, we report major shifts in assemblages associated with the invader and chronicle its continued spread. We examined epibiota associated with clumps of mussels and clumps of Pyura from two rocky shore habitatspools and emergent substrata at two locations. We detected some differences in species richness in biota associated with the two foundation species, but faunal abundance only differed between the locations. These minor changes were dwarfed by the shift in species composition within clumps of each foundation species. Molluscs, particularly gastropods, and crustaceans dominated the assemblage within mussels. In contrast, tubicolous polychaetes dominated the fauna associated with the ascidian. Sessile epifauna, notably barnacles and calcareous tube-dwelling polychaetes, were common on mussels, but never encountered on the ascidian. Multivariate analysis revealed marked dissimilarity (>80%) between the characteristic mussel and ascidian faunas with virtually no overlap.

Excepting the Flower Garden Banks (FGB) and deeper mesophotic banks, no shallow hard substrate has been available offshore since the Holocene. Platforms have facilitated coral geographic expansion in this region. We determined the distribution, abundance, and species diversity patterns on 42 platforms in this region, at <= 37 m depth, along four cross-shelf transects: 1) S-SE from Corpus Christi, Texas; 2) S from Lake Sabine, Texas; 3) S from Terrebonne Bay, Louisiana; and 4) S-SW from Mobile, Alabama. Nine hermatypic, two ahermatypic, and one hydrozoan coral were found: hermatypes-Madracis decactis. Diploria strigosa, Montastraea cavernosa, Porites astreoides, Madracis formosa, Colpophyllia natans, Stephanocoenia intercepta, Stephanocoenia michelinii, and Millepora alcicornis (Hydrozoa); ahermatypes-Tubastraea cocci flea. Oculina diffusa, and Phyllangia americana. Pattern-seeking analyses identified four community types: one with no hermatypic corals (inner and mid-shelf); one high diversity set of platforms, dominated by abundant Madracis decactis, occurring with four other species per platform (outer shelf); and a third dominated by Madracis decactis, in low abundance, co-dominated by D. strigosa and Millepora alcicornis (outer shelf). Species diversity was highest around the Flower Garden Banks. Hermatypic density and D. strigosa (broadcaster) in particular, was maximum around the FGB, extending northwards. Madracis decactis (brooder) densities peaked at the shelf edge, off Terrebonne Bay, Louisiana. Montastraea cavernosa densities were bimodal, peaking near the FGB and east of the Mississippi River. The FGB appear to be the source of hermatypic corals for most platform populations. Differences between the distribution patterns of Madracis decactis and D. strigosa, Montastraea cavernosa, and O. diffusa suggest that the brooder effects longer recruitment distances by averaging larval dispersal over a broad range of hydrographic conditions throughout the year, while the broadcaster utilizes only one set of conditions over the same period. Averaging respective dispersal strategies over decades may have produced the observed disparate distribution patterns. Ahermatypic coral density exceeded hermatypic density by 10,000 fold, peaking south of Terrebonne Bay, Louisiana and Mobile, Alabama, due to T. coccinea. Ahermatypic diversity was highest off Matagorda Island, Texas, decreasing from west to east. Multi-variate pattern-seeking analysis (PATN) identified four ahermatypic community types: one dominated by O. diffusa and T. coccinea in low abundances (shelf-wide distribution); one characterized by the absence of ahermatypic corals (generally near-shore); one heavily dominated by T. coccinea, and also by O. diffusa in low abundances (mid-shelf to shelf edge); and one dominated by T. coccinea, co-dominated by both P. americana and O. diffusa in low abundances (shelf-edge). T. coccinea and P. americana appear to be derived from the southern GOM off Mexico or the Caribbean. Unlike shrinking coral populations in other parts of the world, corals have expanded their range substantially in the northern Gulf of Mexico, in areas previously devoid or near devoid of corals, facilitated by thousands of oil/gas platforms deployed for decades throughout the region.It is also possible that coral populations on these platforms may act as potential larval sources for the FGB in the event of a mass coral mortality there.

Significant discussions and technical studies, based on two decades of experimentation, were carried out, resulting in the definition of seven types of reefs, adapted to the natural and ecological conditions existing around Marseille and guaranteeing the widest possible diversity of crevices, shelters, and attachment sites for marine organisms.After obtaining regulatory approvals from the Prefecture and following the public consultation in 2006, works began in March 2007, for completion in the summer of the year 2008. As planned from the project outset, an 18-month moratorium period came into force on the submersion of the last reef, giving the users the opportunity to define the future management of the whole area jointly.Scientific monitoring will start in 2009 in order to follow the development of various organisms into the reefs and to gain greater knowledge regarding the local functioning of the marine environment and its relationship with these submerged structures.

What is less well understood is how the spatial and temporal variability in mesoscale forcing influences cross-shelf and along-shelf structure of mid-trophic communities and the transfer of carbon from zooplankton and fish to top predators. The investigators will examine mesoscale and finer-scale spatial and temporal relationships between top predators (marine mammals, seabirds), their prey and physical-biological processes in the northern California Current System (CCS) with data sets collected during the multi-ship GLOBEC NEP effort that surveyed waters off Oregon and northern California in 2000 and 2002. Variability in the productivity of the CCS is notably large owing to climate variability on time scales ranging from days (upwelling) to interannual (ENSO) to decadal (Pacific Decadal Oscillation, PDO). While these trends can be best seen from a large-scale view, it is at the mesoscale or finer-scale perspective that predators are exploiting the patches of prey that become available. Two major null hypotheses will be tested: 1) mesoscale forcing, that alters the alongshore upwelling front and equatorward jet, does not affect the cross-shelf and along-shelf density and community structure of top predators; and 2) the spatial scale of plankton and nekton distribution, measured by spatial autocorrelation, is everywhere comparable to that of physical parameters; in turn, the spatial scale of planktivore or piscivore distributions is comparable to the scale of plankton and fish distributions, respectively. The investigators will construct a predictive model of factors affecting top-predator distribution based on 2000 data and will test it using 2002 data. They will also estimate predator abundance and distribution using general additive models and construct a carbon flow model to estimate carbon egested, respired and sequestered by upper trophic levels (as well as carbon removed by migrants). Several modeling approaches will be used to determine the magnitude and significance of prey correspondence or depletion at a range of scales. Spatial heterogeneity will be examined at two levels of the ecosystem: the density or patch size of prey relative to physical oceanographic features and the density of predators relative to their prey. The syntheses proposed herein provide a valuable baseline, for the early part of this century, on top predator response to several scales and sources of variability in the northern CCS. In addition, the synthesis forwards the longer-term development of predictive biophysical models of occurrence patterns of top-predators (many of which are endangered species) in the CCS. Evolution of such models will assist with resource management and planning of human activities (e.g., major fisheries, 5 marine sanctuaries, transportation and commerce) in the northern California Current ecosystem off the west coast of the U.S.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,534609,,,,,,,,H.T.

These deep-water sponges along with their microbial endobionts play key roles in the nitrogen cycling in Arctic-boreal ecosystems. This study aimed to investigate the effects of drilling discharges and associated sediment resuspension events on net fluxes of oxygen, ammonium, nitrate and nitrite in three common deep-water sponge species in the form of explants. Sponges were exposed to suspended bentonite and barite, the primary particulate compounds in drilling waste, as well as suspended natural sediment particles for a period of 33 days (on average 10 mg L-1 for 12 h day(-1)). The exposure period was followed by a pollution abatement period for a further 33 days. No sponge mortality was observed during the experiment. However, exposure to these particles, especially to barite, led to reduced oxygen consumption by up to 33% that was linearly correlated with reduced nitrite nitrate release by the sponges. The changes in net fluxes were accompanied by decreased tissue oxygenation by up to 54% within the sponges. These findings reveal the effects of fine particles on sponge metabolic processes by reducing aerobic respiration and microbial nitrification, and possibly by favouring anaerobic processes such as microbial denitrification. Most of the sponge responses recovered to their control levels upon the pollution abatement period, but the effects caused by barite may not be reversible. Our findings provide the first insight into the ecological consequences of oil and gas drilling activities on sponge-mediated nitrogen cycling in the Arctic-boreal region. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The concentrations of 28 target alkanes and 43 target polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were determined in water samples collected on 10 offshore cruises, in 19 water samples collected monthly one km offshore at 13 inshore stations in 2010 and 2013, and in 16-60 surficial marsh sediment samples collected on each of 26 trips. The concentration of total aromatics in offshore waters peaked in late summer, 2010, at 100 times above the May, 2010 values, which were already slightly contaminated. There were no differences in surface or bottom water samples. The concentration of total aromatics declined at a rate of 73% y(-1) to 1/1000th of the May 2010 values by summer 2016. The concentrations inside the estuary were proportional to those one km offshore, but were 10-30% lower. The oil concentrations in sediments were initially different at 1 and 10 m distance into the marsh, but became equal after 2 years. Thus, the distinction between oiled and unoiled sites became blurred, if not non-existent then, and oiling had spread over an area wider than was visible initially. The concentrations of oil in sediments were 100-1000 times above the May 2010 values, and dropped to 10 times higher after 8 years, thereafter, demonstrating a long-term contamination by oil or oil residues that will remain for decades. The chemical signature of the oil residues offshore compared to in the marsh reflects the more aerobic offshore conditions and water-soluble tendencies of the dissolved components, whereas the anaerobic marsh sediments will retain the heavier molecular components for a long time, and have a consequential effect on the ecosystems.

Referring to nine cases of the worst offshore accident related to structure failure in the previous years (1969-2011), the cause of failure that contribute to oil spill and environmental loss in the previous cases was identified and categorized based on the environmental loss characteristics. Finally, data collected from the past accident is used to design the questionnaire survey in order to obtain the public perception and analysis is done by using average index of non-parametric test and analytic hierarchy process for prioritization the factor of environmental loss factor. The result shows that water pollution, air pollution, marine animal and fisherman denoted as A1, A2, B1 and C1, respectively, are very important are the most affected factor.

These blooms often lead to paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) and extensive closures of shellfish beds. We report here on time-series sediment trap deployments completed at four offshore locations in the gulf between 2005 and 2010 as components of two ECOHAB-GOM field programs. Data presented documents the substantial spatial and temporal fluctuations in Alexandrium fundyense cyst fluxes in the gulf. Cyst delivery out of the euphotic zone peaked primarily between July and August following annual spring-summer Alexandrium blooms and was greatest in the western gulf. At all sites, cyst flux maxima to the subsurface waters were rarely coincident with seasonal peaks in the total mass export of particulate material indicating that cyst delivery was primarily via individually sinking cysts. Where persistent benthic nepheloid layers (BNLs) exist, significant sediment resuspension input of cysts to the near-bottom water column was evidenced by deep cyst fluxes that were up to several orders of magnitude greater than that measured above the BNL. The largest cyst fluxes in the BNL were observed in the eastern gulf, suggesting greater resuspension energy and BNL cyst inventories in this region. Temporal similarities between peak cyst export out of the upper ocean and peak cyst fluxes in the BNL were observed and document the contribution of seasonal, newly formed cysts to the BNL. The data however also suggest that many Alexandrium cells comprising the massive, short-lived blooms do not transition into cysts. Time-series flow measurements and a simple 1D model demonstrate that the BNL cyst fluxes reflect the combined effects of tidal energy-maintained resuspension, deposition, and input of cysts from the overlying water column.

We conducted numerical experiments to assess the applicability of artificial reefs and longlines for seaweed forest restoration in terms of propagule dispersal. We applied hydrodynamic (Environment Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC)), wave (Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN)), and particle tracking models for tidal currents, wave-induced currents, and the dispersal of the propagules, respectively. The major factors for propagule dispersal such as forcing, settling velocity w (s) , and release height were included, and the results of the models were analyzed using dispersal kernel, analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests, and survival rate based on bed elevation. The dispersal distance kernel was fitted to Gaussian and polynomial functions and showed higher wave impacts, whereby the mean dispersal distance was simulated 6.3 m under pure tide and increased by 14 times under the combined tide and wave condition. Propagules were found to hit the bottom intensively during a low-to-flood phase, while wave forcing enhanced vertical dispersal and hindered the intensive sinking. A two-dimensional dispersal location kernel showed that dispersal distance increased with high release heights and its direction faced the shoreline due to shallow water depth and strong wave-induced currents. ANOVA tests regarding the mean distance indicated that w (s) , forcing, release heights, and the combined effect of forcing and w (s) contributed 49.5, 20.5, 5.4, and 22.9 %, respectively, yielding a total of 72 % from w (s) . Adjusting the release height to extend dispersal distances led to A, C, and B locational effects, in order from lowest to highest, while survival rates were 67, 70, and 83 % for A, B, and C, respectively.

Basin-scale indices suggest conditions that would support average to below average coast-wide production across the CCS during this time period. Regional surveys in 2016 sampled anomalously warm surface and subsurface waters across the CCS. Chlorophyll concentrations were low across the CCS in 2016 and, concomitant with that, copepod communities had an anomalously high abundance of subtropical species. Early in 2017 conditions between northern, central, and southern CCS were dissimilar. Specifically, surface conditions north of Cape Mendocino remained anomalously warm, chlorophyll was very low, and subtropical copepods were anomalously abundant. Southern and central CCS surveys indicated that environmental conditions and chlorophyll were within normal ranges for the longer time series, supporting an argument that biophysical conditions/ecosystem states in the southern and central CCS were close to normal.Epipelagic micronekton assemblages south of Cape Mendocino were generally close to longer-term average values, however the northern assemblages have not returned to a normal state following the 2014-15 large marine heatwave and 2016 El Nino. North of Cape Mendocino the epipelagic micronekton was largely composed of offshore and southern derived taxa. We hypothesize that stronger-than-typical winter downwelling in 2017 and a reduced spawning biomass of forage taxa are contributors to the anomalous forage community observed in the north. Also of note, surveys indicate northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) abundance was greater than average (for recent years) and nearer shore in northern regions. Finally, record-low juvenile coho and Chinook salmon catches in the 2017 northern CCS salmon survey suggest that out-migrating Columbia Basin salmon likely experienced unusually high early mortality at sea, and this is further supported by similarities between the 2017 forage assemblage and that observed during poor outmigration survival years in 2004, 2005, and 2015.Generally, the reproductive success of seabirds in 2016 (the most current year available) was low in the north but near average in central California. At Yaquina Head off Oregon and Castle Rock off northern California some of the lowest reproductive success rates on record were documented. In addition to reduced abundance of prey, there was a northward shift of preferred seabird prey. Seabird diets in northern areas also corroborated observations of a northward shift in fish communities. Nest failure was attributed to a combination of bottom-up and top-down forces. At Castle Rock, most chicks died of starvation whereas, at Yaquina Head, most nests failed (95% of common murre, Uria aagle) due to disturbance by bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) seeking alternative prey. Mean bird densities at sea for the 2017 surveys between Cape Flattery Washington and Newport Oregon were the lowest observed and may indicate continued poor reproductive performance of resident breeders in 2017. South of Cape Mendocino, where forage availability was typical, seabird reproductive success was also below average for most species in 2016, but did not approach failure rates observed in the north. Finally, in 2017, abundances of seabirds observed at-sea off southern California were anomalously high suggesting an improved foraging environment in that area.Marine mammal condition and foraging behavior were also impacted by the increased abundance and shifting distribution of the northern anchovy population. Increases in the abundance of northern anchovy in the Southern California Bight coincided with improved condition of sea lion (Zalophus californianus) pups in 2016. Namely, lipid-rich northern anchovy occurred in great frequencies in the nursing female diet. Increases in northern anchovy nearshore in the central and northern CCS may have also contributed to a shoreward shift in distribution of humpback whales (Megaptera -novaeangliae) in these regions. These shifts along with recovering humpback whale populations contributed to recent increases in human-whale interactions (e.g., fixed-gear entanglements).",,,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,22,0,34,,,0575-3317,,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Fisheries Ecol Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 110 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USAUniv Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, 100 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USANOAA, Div Environm Res, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 99 Pacific St,Suite 255A, Monterey, CA 93940 USANOAA, Fisheries Ecol Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 110 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USAUniv Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Ctr Stock Assessment Res, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USAOregon State Univ, Cooperat Inst Marine Resources Studies, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USANOAA, Fish Ecol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv,Hatfield Marine Sci Ct, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USAHumboldt State Univ, Cooperat Inst Marine Ecosyst & Climate, 1 Harpst St, Arcata, CA 95521 USAUniv Calif Santa Cruz, Ocean Sci Dept, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USAMonterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, 7700 Sandholdt Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USAUniv Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 9500 Gilman Dr 0206, La Jolla, CA 92024 USAUniv Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Southern Calif Coastal Ocean Observing Syst, 8880 Biological Grade, La Jolla, CA 92037 USACtr Invest Cientif & Educac Super Ensenada, Oceanol Div, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3918, Ensenada 22860, Baja California, MexicoHatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USANOAA, Fisheries Resources Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USAOregon State Univ, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USANOAA, Auke Bay Labs, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 17109 Pt Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USAUniv Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 NE Boat St, Seattle, WA 98195 USANOAA, Point Adams Res Stn, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 520 Heceta Pl, Hammond, OR 97121 USAMoss Landing Marine Labs, Vertebrate Ecol Lab, 8272 Moss Landing Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USAHumboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, 1 Harpst St, Arcata, CA 95521 USAPoint Blue Conservat Sci, 3820 Cypress Dr,Suite 11, Petaluma, CA 94954 USAFarallon Inst Adv Ecosyst Res, 101 H St, Petaluma, CA 94952 USANOAA, Marine Mammal Lab, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USAUniv Calif San Diego, Marine Phys Lab, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 9500 Gilman Dr, San Diego, CA 92024 USA",Hatfield Marine Sci CtrPoint Blue Conservat SciFarallon Inst Adv Ecosyst Res,,,2017-12-01,WOS:000418377800001,,

The results demonstrate the utility of DGTs as a tool for measuring waterborne contaminants and suggest further research is required to characterise the contaminant plume and determine what effect it might have on the recovery of Otaiti's impacted biological communities.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0028-8330,1175-8805,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Waikato, Fac Sci & Engn, Sch Sci, Environm Res Inst, Hamilton, New ZealandUniv Waikato, Environm Res Inst, Coastal Marine Field Stn, Tauranga, New Zealand",,,,2016-06-01,WOS:000375557200008,,

In this regard, the use of continuous, autonomous systems is considered greatly advantageous due to the costs and limitations of periodic, ship-based sampling campaigns. While various geochemical monitoring tools have been developed their elevated costs and complexities mean that typically only one unit can be deployed at a time, yielding single point temporal data but no spatial data. To address this the authors have developed low-cost pCO(2) sensors (GasPro-pCO(2)) that are small, robust, stable, and which have a low power consumption, characteristics which allow for the deployment of numerous units to monitor the spatial-temporal distribution of pCO(2), temperature, and water pressure in surface water environments. The present article details the results of three field deployments at the natural, CO2-leaking site near Panarea, Island. While the first consisted of 6 probes placed on the sea floor for a 2.5 month period, the other two involved the deployment of 20 GasPro units along a transect through the water column in the vicinity of active CO2 seeps over 2 4 days. Results show both transport and mixing processes and highlight the dynamic nature of the leakage-induced marine geochemical anomalies. Implications for monitoring programs as well as potential impacts are discussed. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Barred sand bass utilized soft-sediment habitats within close proximity to rocky reefs and had home ranges that averaged 10,003 m(2) +/- 4773 m(2) (+/- SD). During the clay, individuals generally used multiple areas on or near reefs, and at night repeatedly used one area over soft-sediment habitat.

In such a facility, methane is degassed from produced brine, this brine is then cooled allowing the extraction of heat and then CO2 is dissolved into it for reinjection into a porous rock formation. Once injected into the porous reservoir formation, this CO2-loaded brine will sink due to its relatively higher density, providing secure storage. Here, for the first time, we investigate, the economic feasibility and energy balance of such a system within the UK North Sea. We examine the suitability of a depleted hydrocarbon field coupled with a saline formation located in the Inner Moray Firth, Scotland. We find that such a system would be highly likely to have a positive energy balance, and would be an order of magnitude cheaper that decommissioning. Furthermore, as only 10% of the site's storage capacity is needed for disposal of the CO2 emissions associated with its operation, there is significant potential for additional revenue creation from storing CO2 from other sources. Whilst the chosen case study site was not ideal, due to its relatively shallow depth, and hence lower than ideal heat potential, it demonstrates that reuse of redundant oil & gas infrastructure that would otherwise be decommissioned could help to offset some of the financial barriers to developing a carbon storage industry in the UK North Sea.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,0,4,,,1750-5836,1878-0148,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, James Hutton Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FE, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2019-11-21,WOS:000495026000003,,

This paper investigates how the principal semidiurnal (M-2) tidal amplitudes and energy dissipation respond to the nonuniform sea level changes induced by complete ice sheet collapses. The sea level changes are calculated using gravitationally self-consistent sea level theory, and the tides are simulated using an established tidal model. Results from the simulations show global and spatially heterogeneous changes in tidal amplitudes. In addition, pronounced changes in tidal energy dissipation occur in both the open ocean and in shelf-seas, also altering the location of tidal mixing fronts. These changes have the potential to impact ocean mixing, and hence large-scale currents and climate patterns, and the contribution of shelf-sea to the global carbon cycle.

Approximately 90% of the birds we observed were sea ducks, predominantly long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyematis), king eiders (Somateria spectabilis), and scoters (Melanitta spp.). Densities of most species decreased with distance from shore, although king eider densities were higher in deeper, offshore waters. Densities of long-tailed ducks increased in nearshore coastal lagoons at the onset of post-breeding moult, and densities of eiders increased offshore during their peak moult migration. In general, bird densities were highest in areas with less than 30% ice cover, although high densities of king eiders occurred in areas with 30%-60% ice cover.

To understand its success on such artificial substrata we examined various aspects of its life history and population dynamics. A. biserialis is a gonochoric brooder. The percentage of colonies on the artificial substrata bearing gonads ranged from none (September 1994 and 1995) to 100% (January 1994, 1995 and April 1994). Mature oocytes and sperm sacs reached rather small maximum diameters of 240 and 160 mu m, respectively, probably dictated by the small gastrovascular cavities. A continuous release of planulae was observed in the laboratory from March to July 1995. Planulation occurred during various lunar phases, and both by day and night. Recruitment of A. biserialis on PVC plates attached to the jetties coincided with the breeding period inferred from the laboratory findings. Recruits reached a maximum height of 3 cm within 3 months, thus exhibiting a remarkably rapid growth rate compared with other gorgonians. This high colony growth rate may compensate for the lack of clonal propagation in the studied A. biserialis population. The complex substrata of the jetties provide the conditions required for successful colonization, which include upside-down orientation, an adequate light regime and exposure to flow.

The currents may, for example, affect the amount of food supplied to the organisms or they may control the ability of spores and larvae to settle and grow on the seabed. By their very nature, tidal energy devices will disturb the current flow near the seabed with the degree of disurbance depending on the design of the device. In particular a wake will be produced downstream of the body of the device as well as a defined zone of increased turbulence downstream of the blades or rotor. These disturbances to the ambient flow may be expected to have an influence on the benthic communities present on the seabed. Observations of the benthos at three fixed sites downstream of the SeaGen tidal turbine over four years have shown no influence of the device on the benthos; however these observations are very limited spatially. Ultimately there is a need to be able to predict the possible influence of a tidal device or devices on the benthos rather than relying on costly post-installation surveys. One of the main difficulties in being able to make predictions has been the inabiltiy to predict changes in the ambient current flow resulting from tidal energy devices. However recent developments in numerical modelling have the potential to describe at a scale of 1m or better the flowfield downstream from tidal energy devices with early results indicating that there may be localised semi-permanent zones of increased or decreased flow associated with a typical device. Arising from these developments, the proposal intends to carry out detailed benthic surveys downstream of the SeaGen tidal energy device in Strangford Narrows and compare the benthic community distributions with the current field predicted from the high resolution numerical models. The comparison will make a major step in understanding the consequences of flow changes resulting from tidal energy devices on the benthos and also allow predictions to be made for future device deployments. Queen's University Belfast will oversee the required benthic sampling programme, which will be carried out by personnel from NUI Galway, and will liaise closely with the University of Edinburgh (UoE) who are developing the necessary numerical model within a separate component bid of FLOWBEC. The model will allow current predictions at a spatial scale of 1m or better. Benthic distributions will be characterised by a major series of drop-down video images taken up to 200m downstream of SeaGen during the spring in two consecutive years. The position of each image will be recorded to better than 1m using a precision underwater DGPS system. The video images will be analysed by the University of Galway to quantify the benthos and the nature of the seabed at each sampling point. Statistical analyses will be carried out in close liaison with the UoE team to establish the relationship between the mean velocity and the turbulent velocity component and the distribution of the benthos. Close attention will be paid to assessing an appropriate parameter to describe the turbulent component of the velocity that is appropriate to the biology. The analysis will also consider the interaction between the benthos and the physical nature of the seabed. The study, which will develop ongoing work establishing the relationship between currents and benthic communities on a coarser spatial scale, is supported by MCT, the developers of SeaGen. The results will be of major value to the marine energy industry as a whole by allowing the prediction of relationships between benthic communities and changes in the ambient current field resulting from the installation of tidal energy devices.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/J00426X/1,,,,,,,,Queen's University of Belfast,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15329314,,

However, they are slow-growing, easily damaged, and especially vulnerable to damage by passive fishing gear such as pots and traps. Despite their potential importance, until recently, sea whips have been generally understudied in this region. We examined the colony complexity, length, age, and growth of sea whips from four artificial reef sites in the mid-Atlantic region to gain a better understanding of their biology in the area. There were no significant differences in the bifurcation (R-b) and tributary to source (T/S) ratios between sites, with the R-b approximate to 3 for all sites, indicating similar complexity between sites. The total length distribution was 8.3 cm to 85.3 cm, and 50% of corals in the range of 34.2-56.4 cm. Age, estimated from annual growth ring counts, ranged from 2 to 15 y, with 50% of corals in the range of 6 to 8 y. The large proportion of middle-sized and middle-aged corals suggests episodic recruitment. Age-length keys showed the trend of age increasing with total coral length, and a von Bertalanffy growth model demonstrated size-dependent growth following the equation: E[L vertical bar t] (cm) = 86.1(1-e(0.14(t-1.44))).

Despite the significant oil and gas industrial activities underway in the Campos Basin, scarce information is available regarding the hydrocarbon contents and microbial communities in the deep-sea sediments. To gain new insights on these aspects, we first obtained deep-sea sediment samples with different degrees of oil exposure. We obtained samples from a seabed fissure (N = 28), surroundings (250 m to 500 m from the fissure: N = 24), and a control area (N = 4).We used shotgun metagenomics to characterize the taxonomic and metabolic diversity and analyzed biogeochemical parameters (metal and oil concentration) of all samples. The high levels of unresolved complex mixture of hydrocarbons in the fissure indicate a potentially recent petrogenic contribution in these sediments. The fissure area was found to have a higher abundance of hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial genera and hydrocarbon degradation genes. These bacteria may be used as biosensors of sediment contamination.

Ecosystem assessments are required to identify ecosystems at risk of collapse, but they should account for cross-system linkages and dynamics where necessary. This is particularly true for coastal wetlands (e.g. seagrass, mangroves and saltmarsh), which exhibit high ecological connectivity and have individually suffered global declines over the last century. We use the coastal wetlands of Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, as a model system to examine how integrating outcomes of multiple, simultaneously conducted, ecosystem assessments can assist in identifying appropriate management and conservation strategies. We simultaneously conducted separate assessments of seagrass, mangrove and saltmarsh ecosystems against the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria. Despite substantial human population growth in the region, seagrass and mangroves were assessed as Least Concern. Mangroves were found to be rapidly encroaching on saltmarsh. This process, together with past clearing, were the major drivers behind saltmarsh being assessed as Endangered. Given the importance of connectivity among these connected ecosystems, collapse in any one ecosystem can have seascape-wide consequences, highlighting the benefit of conducting multi-ecosystem assessments. Consequently, a fully integrated assessment of the coastal wetlands as a single entity would miss key processes, such as mangrove encroachment, potentially underestimating overall risks. Our study highlights the plight of saltmarsh and the value of conducting simultaneous RLE assessments for multiple ecosystems comprising seascapes. We recommend that connectivity be accounted for explicitly in assessments of other connected, high-risk ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,15,0,19,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,,,,,,,"Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Australian Rivers Inst Coast & Estuaries, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, AustraliaGriffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Australian Rivers Inst Coast & Estuaries, Nathan, Qld 4111, AustraliaMacquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, AustraliaEureka Publishing, 1-3 Theobald 5t, Thornbury, Vic 3071, AustraliaUniv Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, AustraliaHlth Land & Water, POB 13086,George 5t, Brisbane, Qld 4003, AustraliaAlluvium Consulting Australia, 14-36 Agnes St, Fortitude Valley, Qld 4006, Australia",Eureka PublishingHlth Land & WaterAlluvium Consulting Australia,,,2020-08-12,WOS:000540278400017,,

Beach and dune system was severely affected, as over a kilometre long strip of coastal sand dunes were destroyed. Results suggest that the wreck acted like an offshore breakwater, trapped sediment around the site, and created a sediment deficit with consequent erosion south of the site. Coastal retreat occurred at a rate of 7 to 8 m/year, over a period of 10 - 12 years, along 1.5 km of sea front. A comparison of the impact of similar grounded vessels around the globe confirms that shipwrecks in shallow seas have the potential of drastically altering the face of the coast, often within a short time. Major factors that determine the fate of the coast subsequent to a shipwreck are: distance of the wreck from the shore, the depth of water, the span of time when the wreck remains aground, the orientation of the vessel with respect to the shore, the direction and intensity of prevailing winds, the consequent wave regime, the resultant littoral currents and the disruption of sediment transfer along the shore.

Here, we used passive acoustic telemetry to examine the effects of a jetty and artificial light on the rates of predation of flatback turtle (Natator depressus) hatchlings as they disperse through nearshore waters. When released near a jetty, around 70% of the tagged hatchlings were predated before they could transit the nearshore, irrespective of the presence or absence of artificial light. Only 3 to 23% of hatchlings encountered predators at a second study site nearby where there was no jetty and a similar amount of nesting activity. Evidence for predation was provided by rapid tag detachment due to prey handling by a predator or the extensive movement of the tags within the receiver array suggesting that the tag (and hatchling) was inside the stomach of a predator. We found that 70% of the fish predators that consumed tags used the jetty as a refuge during the day and expanded their range along nearshore waters at night, predating on hatchlings in areas adjacent to the jetty with the highest nesting density. Sampling of potential predators including lutjanid reef fishes under the jetty revealed the presence of turtle hatchlings in their gut contents. By providing daytime refuges for predators, nearshore structures such as jetties have the potential to concentrate predators and they may pose a significant threat to populations of vulnerable species. Such effects must be taken into consideration when assessing the environmental impacts associated with these structures.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,10,0,19,,,0006-3207,1873-2917,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, Indian Ocean Marine Res Ctr, Australian Inst Marine Sci, M096,35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, AustraliaDept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Marine Sci Program, 17 Dick Perry Ave, Kensington, WA 6151, AustraliaPendoley Environm, 12A Pitt Way, Booragoon, WA 6154, Australia",Dept Biodivers Conservat & AttractPendoley Environm,,,2019-09-17,WOS:000483908400062,,

River-mouth anchor stations were occupied for diurnal tidal cycles during three stages of river flow, and reoccupied for consecutive spring and neap tides during two stages of river flow. At each anchor station, box cores were collected every two hours and complementary time-series measurements were made of water-column suspended-sediment concentrations, salinity, and current velocities.During high-energy periods in the fortnightly cycle (i.e. most spring tides), a cross-laminated sand layer is present at the seabed surface that exhibits varying degrees of bi-directional current structure and contains low porewater salinities (10-15 parts per thousand). During low-energy periods in the fortnightly cycle (i.e., most neap tides), a mud bed forms at the seabed surface in association with fluid muds in the water column. This mud layer ranges in thickness from 2 to 15 cm, and exhibits higher radionuclide activities, higher porewater salinities (15-25 parts per thousand), and lower saturated bulk densities (1.18-1.30 g/cm(3)) than the sand beds (1.30-1.60 g/cm(3)). The mud beds are subject to resuspension and deposition by semidiurnal tidal currents that form thin sandy interlaminations.Interlamination and interbedding of sand and mud result from the combination of estuarine and tidal processes at the river mouth. Interlaminations (alternating layers of sand and mud <1 cm in thickness) can be produced semidiurnally due to tidal fluctuations, as well as fortnightly during periods of moderate tidal energy. Interbedding is entirely a fortnightly feature. Low-energy fortnightly periods produce a more stratified water column, and fluid mud forms as a result of estuarine circulation under conditions of decreased vertical mixing. High-energy fortnightly periods increase mixing and destratify the water column, thus resuspending part or all of the fluid mud and producing bedload transport of sand. The fine- and coarse-grained beds are both preserved, forming interbedded (alternate layers >1 cm in thickness) muds and sands. The thickness of the fortnightly beds is dependent upon monthly variations in spring/neap amplitudes.The processes active near the Amazon river mouth that form interlaminated and interbedded sediments operate in other fluvial-marine settings, and produce similar types of interlayered sediments due to the presence of estuarine circulation, high suspended-sediment concentrations, and tidal energy.",,,,,,,,,69,1,0,0,10,0,83,,,0025-3227,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1995-07-01,WOS:A1995RT48900005,,

The study was conducted in two identical artificial reef mesocosms during seven weeks. Experimental tanks were maintained respectively at mean pH(T) 7.7 and 8.05 (with field-like night and day variations). The major physico-chemical parameters were identical, only pCO2 and pH(T) differed.

This leads to difficulties in determination of interrelations between benthos and fouling communities. The littoral fouling communities cannot be considered as an independent ecological group of the same rank as plankton or benthos because it lacks a unique species composition. The fouling is always a derivate of the benthos, so it could be defined as a community formed by benthic organisms during succession on a solid substrate more or less remote from the water body's, bottom. All peculiarities of the fouling communities distinguishing them from similar benthic communities are determined by topology and other properties of the substrate, by relatively short period of the latter's exposition and by hydrological conditions under which the fouling is developing. There is continual transitions between benthic and fouling communities both in space (along gradients of abiotic environmental factors) and in time (along successional series). Such a continuum becomes most frequently broken due to both significant remoteness of the substrate, on which a fouling develops, from the bottom and permanent extreme factors disturbing or retarding fouling communities development. Thus, littoral foulings are just benthos being formed under specific conditions. At the same time, oceanic foulings are connected both evolutionary and ecologically with littoral foulings and benthos.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0044-4596,,,,,,,,,,,"Russian Acad Sci, Inst Zool, White Sea Biol Stn, St Petersburg 199034, Russia",,,,2009-11-01,WOS:000273187500004,20063771,

However, the degree to which sea otters may actually be affected by human-caused oil spills or exposure to natural oil seeps is currently unknown. Between 2012 and 2014, the U.S. Geological Survey and collaborating agencies conducted a telemetry-based study of sea otters in Santa Barbara channel, in order to provide critical information for resource managers (specifically the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, henceforth BOEM, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, henceforth USFWS) about the spatial ecology, population status, and potential population threats to sea otters in Santa Barbara Channel, with particular reference to exposure to manmade structures and sources of oil and natural gas. Analysis of spatial monitoring data using a Bayesian-based synoptic model allowed for description of sea otter home ranges, identification of hot-spots of use, and insights into habitat selection behavior by male and female sea otters. Important findings included the deeper modal depth preferred by males versus females, strong preferences by both sexes for areas with persistent kelp canopy, and greater use of soft-sediment areas by males. The synoptic model also provided the ability to predict population-level density distribution for each sex in new habitats: by calculating the value of these probability density distributions at the known locations of natural seeps, we were able to identify those seeps with higher potential for sea otter encounters. The relative probability of occurrence at locations near to some seeps was sufficiently high (about 1% likelihood of occurrence for some of our study animals) that one would anticipate occasional encounters. Data on male and female survival, reproductive success, activity budgets, and body condition all indicated that sea otters in Santa Barbara Channel are not resource limited, and thus we would expect to see continued strong population growth in this area. However, the principal cause of death for study animals was lethal bites by white sharks, suggesting that shark bite mortality represents the single biggest threat to continued population growth in the Santa Barbara Channel.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,0196-1497,,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA, 22092, USA",,,,2017-08-31,ZOOREC:ZOOR15309054638,,

As a result of this exposure, the ecology, climate, pedology, and geology of global shorelines were dramatically transformed, which in turn altered the carbon cycle and biodynamics of this new landmass. In this paper, we focus on a little-known hydrogeological phenomenon that may have had profound influences on biodiversity, human evolution, and carbon storage during periods of severe climatic stress of the Pleistocene Ice Ages. We propose that freshwater springs appeared on emerged continental shelves because falling sea level not only drew down and steepened the coastal water table gradient, thus increasing the hydrostatic head on inland groundwater aquifers, but also removed up to 120 m of hydrostatic pressure on the shelf, further enhancing groundwater flow. We call this phenomenon the coastal oasis, a model based on three well-established facts. (1) In all coastal areas of the world, continental aquifers discharge a continuous flow of fresh water to the oceans, (2) Many submarine sedimentary and morphological features, as well as seepages and flow of fresh water, are known on and below the shelves from petroleum explorations, deep-sea drilling programs, and mariners' observations. (3) Hydraulic principles (Darcy's law) predict increased groundwater flow at the coast when sea level drops because the piezometric head increases by the equivalent depth of sea-level lowering. Sea level is presently in a relatively high interglacial position. Direct observation and verification of our model is difficult and must rely on explorations of terrain that are now deeply submerged on continental shelves. For this reason, we draw parallels between our predicted model and simple, well-exposed terrestrial hydrological systems, such as present-day springs that appear on the exposed shores of lakes whose free-air water levels fell during periods of aridity. Such modem examples are seen in the Caspian Sea and Dead Sea, the Afar Depression, and the Sahara Desert. These modem analogues demonstrate the likelihood that underground water will be more abundant on emerged shelves during sea-level fall, causing springs, oases, and wetlands to appear. Our model creates an apparent paradox: in tropical and subtropical arid lands, such as most of Africa, sea-level fall during hyperarid glacial phases would produce abundant fresh water flow onto emerged continental shelves as the continental interior desiccated. Thus, emergent shoreline springs provided new habitats for terrestrial vegetation and animals displaced from the interior by increasingly and conditions, shrinking ecosystems, and dwindling water supplies, Such a scenario would have had a profound influence on the vegetation that spreads naturally to colonize the emerged shelves during glacio-eustatic sea-level lowstands, as well as creating new habitats for terrestrial mammals, including early humans.

This paper provides an overview and analysis of current issues related to CCS projects and CCS technologies. The paper also assesses risks and costs as well as policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks relevant for CCS and the major countries with CCS deployment. Currently, the few CCS projects in operation are mostly for EOR purposes. However, miscible CO2-EOR in depleted oil and gas reservoirs appears to be the industry's first choice for CO2 sequestration and increasing oil production. Potential CO2 leakage is a major risk for pipelines and geological storage and a comprehensive monitoring program needs to be developed to ascertain its impact on pipeline material integrity, humans, and the environment. The cost of the CCS chain largely depends on the compression solvent for the synthesis gas or flue gas treatment for separation, heat rate, energy required for capture, capital costs of capture equipment, pipeline diameter, and flow capacity, and the homogeneity and permeability of the geological formations. An effective carbon pricing and cap-and-trade system as a part of national carbon policy is needed to achieve the goal of CCS.

Current wild harvests mostly target canopy-forming kelp, rockweed and red macroalgae that provide important ecosystem roles, including primary production, carbon storage, nutrient cycling, habitat provision, biodiversity and fisheries support. Harvest methods range from selective hand-cutting to bottom trawling. Resulting ecosystem impacts depend on extraction method and scale, ranging from changes in primary production to habitat disruption, fragmentation, food-web alterations and bycatch of non-target species. Current management often aims for sustainable harvesting in a single-species context, although some agencies acknowledge the wider ecosystem structure, functions and services seaweeds provide. We outline potential ecosystem-based management approaches that would help sustain productive and diverse seaweed-based ecosystems. These include maintaining high canopy biomass, recovery potential, habitat structure and connectivity, limiting bycatch and discards, while incorporating seasonal closures and harvest-exclusion zones into spatial management plans. Other sustainability considerations concern monitoring, enforcement and certification standards, a shift to aquaculture, and addressing cumulative human impacts, invasive species and climate change.

Based on the data for landings and effort, weighted catch per unit of effort (CPUE) is computed for the trawl, purse seine and traditional fleets. The weighted CPUE differentiates the quality or composition of catch through weighting of the species mix in the catch by the share of total revenue of each species. Similarly, the various inputs that constitute fishing effort are weighted by their respective cost shares. The ratio of the Tornqvist chain catch and effort indices was used to measure intertemporal productivity changes in the respective fisheries. The results showed that the weighted CPUE was the highest for purse seine on the east and west coasts of Peninsular Malaysia. However, the productivity of purse seine fleet has not been tremendously increased over time. The productivities of trawl and traditional fleets on the east and west coasts were low. Restricting fishing effort through vessel limitation programs is viewed as a possible way of raising the productivities of these fleets. In addition, productivity increases can be achieved by enhancement of the resource stocks such as through the construction of artificial reefs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Concentrations of 7 (1980s) or 17 (1999-2015) metals in 423 surface sediments from 134 stations, plus 563 samples from 30 cores were highly variable, primarily as a function of sediment granulometry with naturally greater metals concentrations in fine-grained, Al-rich sediment. Metals versus Al correlation plots were used to normalize metals concentrations and identify values significantly above background. Barium, Cr, Cu, Hg, and Pb concentrations were above background, but variable, within 250 m of some offshore sites where drilling occurred between 1981 and 2001; these areas totaled <6 km(2) of 11 000 km(2) in the total lease area. Random and fixed sampling along the coastal Beaufort Sea from 1985 to 2015 yielded 40 positive anomalies for metals in surface sediments (similar to 0.8% of 5082 data points). About 85% of the anomalies were from developed areas. Half the anomalies were for the 5 metals found enhanced near drilling sites. No metals concentrations, except As, exceeded accepted sediment quality criteria. Interannual shifts in metals values for surface sediments at inner shelf sites were common and linked to storm-induced transitions in granulometry; however, metal-to-Al ratios were uniform during these shifts. Sediment cores generally recorded centuries of background values, except for As, Fe, and Mn. These 3 metals were naturally enriched in sediments from deeper water (>100 m) via diagenetic remobilization at sediment depths of 5 to 15 cm, upward diffusion, and precipitation in surface oxic layers. Minimal evidence for anthropogenic inputs of metals, except near some exploratory drilling sites, is consistent with extraction of most oil from land or barrier islands in the Alaskan Arctic and restricted offshore activity to date.

We examine two marine-based industries that incidentally take migratory birds in Canada: (1) commercial fisheries, through bycatch, and (2) offshore oil and gas exploration, development, and production. We summarize information from the scientific literature and technical reports and also present new information from recently analyzed data to assess the magnitude and scope of mortality. Fisheries bycatch was responsible for the highest levels of incidental take of migratory bird species; estimated combined take in the longline, gillnet, and bottom otter trawl fisheries within the Atlantic, including the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and Pacific regions was 2679 to 45,586 birds per year. For the offshore oil and gas sector, mortality estimates ranged from 188 to 4494 deaths per year due to the discharge of produced waters resulting in oil sheens and collisions with platforms and vessels; however these estimates for the oil and gas sector are based on many untested assumptions. In spite of the uncertainties, we feel levels of mortality from these two industries are unlikely to affect the marine bird community in Canada, but some effects on local populations from bycatch are likely. Further research and monitoring will be required to: (1) better estimate fisheries-related mortality for vulnerable species and populations that may be impacted by local fisheries, (2) determine the effects of oil sheens from produced waters, and attraction to platforms and associated mortality from collisions, sheens, and flaring, so that better estimates of mortality from the offshore oil and gas sector can be obtained, and (3) determine impacts associated with accidental spills, which are not included in our current assessment. With a better understanding of the direct mortality of marine birds from industry, appropriate mitigation and management actions can be implemented. Cooperation from industry for data collection, research to fill knowledge gaps, and implementation of mitigation approaches will all be needed to conserve marine birds in Canada.",,,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,33,0,40,,,1712-6568,,,,,,,,,,,"Cawthron Inst, Coastal & Freshwater Grp, Nelson, New ZealandMem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF A1C 5S7, CanadaYork Univ, Fac Environm Studies, N York, ON M3J 1P3, CanadaBedford Inst Oceanog, Dept Fisheries & Oceans, Populat Ecol Div, Bedford, England",,,,2013-12-01,WOS:000329315700004,,

However, human activities such as offshore oil and gas operations increasingly threaten marine and coastal ecosystems, for which there has been little exploration into the spatial and temporal risks of offshore oil operations. Using the Gulf of Mexico, one of the world's hottest spots of offshore oil and gas mining, as the study area, we propose a spatiotemporal approach that integrates spatial statistics and geostatistics in a geographic information system environment to provide insight to environmental management and decision making for oil and gas operators, coastal communities, local governments, and the federal government. We use the records from 1995 to 2015 of twelve types of hazards caused by offshore oil and gas operations, and analyze them spatially over a five year period. The spatial clusters of these hazards are analyzed and mapped using Getis-Ord Gi and local Moran's I statistics. We then design a spatial correlation coefficient matrix for multivariate spatial correlation, which is the ratio of the cross variogram of two types of hazards to the product of the variograms of the two hazards, showing a primary understanding of the degrees of spatial correlation among the twelve types hazards. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first application of spatiotemporal analysis methods to environmental hazards caused by offshore oil and gas operations; the proposed methods can be applied to other regions for the management and monitoring of environmental hazards caused by offshore oil operations.

Today's experiences is from onshore North America and China. The technology is mature for onshore use, with 40 years of injection in the USA. Implementing CO2-EOR offshore is definitely more challenging and carries operational, commercial and financial risks.Offshore Norway we have 20 years of experience with storing CO2 in geological formations and a lot of work has been done to map and evaluate possible storage sites (CO2 Storage Atlas Norwegian Continental shelf).

Indirect, risk-based effects of human activity are known to be important in structuring some terrestrial ecosystems, but these impacts have largely been neglected in oceans. Here, we synthesize existing literature and data to explore multiple lines of evidence that collectively suggest diverse human activities are changing marine ecosystems, including carbon storage capacity, in myriad ways by altering predation risk. We provide novel, compelling evidence that at least one key human activity, overfishing, can lead to distinct, cascading risk effects in natural ecosystems whose magnitude exceeds that of presumed lethal effects and may account for previously unexplained findings. We further discuss the conservation implications of human-caused indirect risk effects. Finally, we provide a predictive framework for when human alterations of risk in oceans should lead to cascading effects and outline a prospectus for future research. Given the speed and extent with which human activities are altering marine risk landscapes, it is crucial that conservation and management policy considers the indirect effects of these activities in order to increase the likelihood of success and avoid unfortunate surprises.",,,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,45,0,58,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,"Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, AustraliaSimon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Evolutionary & Behav Ecol Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, CanadaUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAFlorida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, North Miami, FL 33181 USA",,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000367982900004,26448058,

Both approaches and environmental risk model are described, which results make it possible to estimate probability of acceptable impact on the shelf ecosystem. In contrast to existing approaches related to ranking and compiling risk matrices, the proposed method based on probabilistic ecoscreening risk assessment takes into account not only the altering conditions of external influence on the shelf ecosystem, but also the intraannual dynamics of its main components. This makes it possible to calculate the ecological risk not as a fixed value for the ecosystem under study, but as its component changing over the course of a year along with the intra-annual functioning dynamics. The latter is especially important for the coastal basins, where processes of various genesis are concentrated, high gradients of biomass values and concentrations of components containing it are presented. To simulate various scenarios of combining the effect of external stressors with the intra-annual dynamics of the ecosystem functioning, the Northern Caspian shelf basin was selected, which is subject to intense river flow and to exposure to mineral resources development technologies, including oil and gas. Ecological risk values were calculated taking into account combination of adverse natural factors and implementation of emergency and regular anthropogenic impacts at different periods of the shelf ecosystem components natural dynamics. Results made it possible to assess probabilities of the allowable exposure of shelf ecosystem, to identify areas with the 100% probability of allowable impact and especially critical areas with less than 5% of the impact probability. Calculations show not only efficiency of the proposed approach, but also open possibility of harmonizing ecological and economic requirements in the development of shelf resources. For areas with high allowable impact probability, it is possible to reduce the economic costs of ensuring ecological safety. Ecological risk areas, which are characterized by low estimate of allowable impact probability require an increase in the safety economic expenses. The proposed approach to estimating the intra-annual risk dynamics is of interdisciplinary nature and could be useful both to specialists in the ecology area, in the related fields, and to management personnel in making decisions on redistributing economic expenses and minimizing them while maintaining the priority of environmental safety.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,,,,,,,"Russian Acad Sci, PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow 117997, Russia",,,,2020-09-30,WOS:000570081600009,,

Multibeam processing methods now offer improved capacities for raw data storage. The Simrad SP90 sonar was used for the detection of fish schools associated with drifting fish aggregating devices (FADs), and digital systems developed for the acquisition and processing of volume backscattering echoes and position data. Data sampling methods were defined based on two modes: one for periods searching for FADs and associated schools, and one for school monitoring in drifting mode. Validation of the detection of several FAD-associated schooling species was made by simultaneous visual observations or/and cross-checking with echosounder recordings. The characteristics of schooling behaviour in the targeted fish species are fundamental for the correct interpretation of acoustic data. Sonar detection threshold is the result of a compromise between fish number, size, species and the nearest neighbour distance (NND) of individuals per dynamic structure (school or shoal). Tuna schooling dynamics mean that NND can sometimes be too large to allow the presence of these fish to be detected, despite their number. Sonar data should be analysed and interpreted in a holistic manner, in combination with behaviour pattern and dynamics of all species around the drifting FADs. An autonomous sonar buoy prototype equipped with 360 scanning sonar coupled to video cameras will increase our understanding of tuna behaviour around drifting or anchored objects. A similar methodology can be applied to different kinds of platforms, either anchored or in permanent positions. This would improve the monitoring of fish schools around artificial reefs, open sea aquaculture farms, and across estuaries, channels or straits; applications which are undoubtedly essential for progressive fisheries management.",,,,,,,,,22,2,0,0,18,0,24,,,0990-7440,1765-2952,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aegean, Co IRD UR 109, Ctr Rech Halieut Mediterraneenne & Trop, F-34203 Sete, FranceUniv Aegean, Fisheries & Sonar Lab, Mitilini 81100, GreeceUS004, Ctr Bretagne, Inst Rech Dev, F-29280 Plouzane, FranceInst Marine Res, N-5817 Bergen, Norway",Univ Aegean,,,2007-10-01,WOS:000253450800011,,

The organic matter accumulated by plants, together with deposition of inorganic mineral sediments, contributes to vertical marsh growth and determines the marsh ability to cope with regional sea level rise. Deposition of mineral sediment, in turn, alters the growth of plant roots and shoots, and further marsh morphology and blue carbon storage. Based on mesocosm experiments simulating the sedimentation intensity, this paper examined the responses of Spartina alterniflora (a plant widely distributed in global salt marshes) to sediment deposition events (0-24 cm thicknesses). The plant height increased by 1.51 cm on average with 1 cm sediment deposition. New roots grew into the deposited sediment layers, resulting in a significant increase in the below-ground biomass. The below-ground biomass doubled with the treatment of 24 cm deposition thickness in comparison with that without deposition. The depth-dependent distribution of below-ground biomass changed from a monotonous (decreasing with soil depth) to a non-monotonic (increasing first and then decreasing) trend. This illustrates the growth of marsh plants in response to sediment deposition disturbance (similar to artificial or storm-induced sediment deposition) and have important implications for further investigations on marsh resiliency, blue carbon storage and marsh morphology.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,,,,,,,"Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Peoples R ChinaEast China Normal Univ, Inst Ecochongming, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China",,,,2020-05-22,WOS:000527916600018,,

Under appropriate meteorological conditions these emissions react to form ozone (0-54 mu g/m(3) over-water) which can affect the marine environment. Using a dry deposition model, this work examines the amount of ozone derived from oil and gas offshore operations and deposited in the sea surface of the Gulf of Mexico, and assesses its impact on the neuston of the sea-surface microlayer. Surface integrated estimates of ozone deposited from oil and gas operations over the sea surface ranges from 400 kg to 1800 kg which results in sea surface concentrations of similar to 15 mu g/m(3). This estimate and the actual toxic ozone levels suggest no acute, toxic impacts to the neuston. However, indirect effects may occur through changes to the pelagic foodwebs and organic carbon pathways. Another potential pathway for ozone impacting the environment is through the production of bromate. Based on the concentrations and time scales (11-139 days) only sublethal effects appear to occur, but uncertainties associated with this assessment need to be further studied.

Using Maximum entropy modelling, suitable sperm whale habitat was predicted over the continental shelf break, but more specifically, over sub-marine canyons.

Although this is a promising technology for reducing atmospheric CO2, it is only affordable if the confinement of the gas is guaranteed for hundreds of years. Hence, it is of paramount importance to figure out and predict the chemical and biological effects associated with potential CO2 leakage, to provide decision makers with a good basis for choosing technology and potential storage sites. To this end, a titanium reactor (1.4 m(3)) was used to study CO2 seepage under realistic sub-seabed conditions (30 bar pressure and 7 degrees C). The injection of CO2 was calibrated to decrease the pH value from 8.1 to 7.3, which may be the pH found near a leakage point. This pH value also coincides with predictions for near-future ocean pH under current CO2 emissions worldwide. The results from this study demonstrate that there are some elements, i.e., Fe, Co, Pb, Ce, Zn and Cu, present in deep marine sediments, that are strongly affected by the reduced pH levels related to CO2 addition. The dissolved concentrations of Fe, Pb and, to a lesser extent, Cr increased, due probably to weakening of the Fe/Mn shuttle by increased dissolved concentrations of CO2. Desorption processes from oxyhydroxide surfaces due to acidification may explain the release of Co, Ni and Ce observed during the experiment. The increased CO2 concentration also led to increased metal bioavailability, suggested by higher values for labile metal species. Conversely, Cd mobility seems not to be affected by CO2-associated acidification. It is concluded that the determination of those elements most affected by CO2-related acidification in a sub-seabed CO2 storage perimeter (i.e., sediment, sediment-water interface and water column) would be a simple and effective technique to verify suspected leakage.

However, owing to its unique geographical position, this area has been transformed into an industrial hub dominated by oil and gas production, refining and transportation facilities. This study investigates the status of macrobenthos along with associated hydro-sedimentological data at 30 stations, sampled within three industrially active zones of the MNPS. The bottom water and sediment characteristics recorded in the study area fulfil the prescribed criteria for ecosensitive zones of India, despite the various stressors operational in the region. The univariate parameters suggest a healthy macrobenthic community except for a few pockets of stressed environment. However, CCA and correlation analyses indicate that even at low levels, petroleum hydrocarbons, along with sediment texture, were influencing polychaete community structure. As this protected area is denoted a high oil spill risk area, polychaete/amphipod ratio was employed to verify the environmental status which revealed that a major part of the study area had a good representation of oil-sensitive amphipods. The current study is the first of its kind to provide valuable baseline data of macrobenthos along with prevailing environmental conditions in this ecosensitive area. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the paucity of geospatial and carbon storage information along the Pacific Coast of Canada hinders the inclusion of blue carbon storage data in conservation planning and policy development in coastal habitats. We assessed the carbon storage and accumulation rates in three eel grass (Zostera marina) meadows in southern Clayoquot Sound on the Pacific Coast of British Columbia. The intertidal and subtidal portions of each meadow were mapped and sampled to estimate eelgrass density, biomass, and carbon, and sediment cores were analyzed to estimate sediment carbon storage and accumulation rates. Aboveground biomass measurements were consistent with estimates for Z marina in other regions, with average aboveground carbon biomass estimates of 16.78 g C m(-2) and 16.25 g C m(-2) in the intertidal and subtidal areas, respectively. However, the estimated aboveground to belowground biomass ratio was an order of magnitude higher than for seagrass species in temperate/tropical areas, largely because belowground biomass was up to 10 times lower than for other Z marina meadows, averaging 6.17 g C m(-2) and 5.03 g C m(-2) in the intertidal and subtidal zones, respectively. Sediment carbon concentrations did not exceed 1.30%C-org, and carbon accumulation rates ranged from 2.90-39.61 g C-org M-2 yr(-1), decreasing with depth and averaging 10.8 5.2 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1). While sediment carbon stocks were generally higher in the eelgrass meadows relative to non-vegetated reference sites, carbons stocks averaged 1343 +/- 482 g C-org m(-2), substantially less than global averages. These carbon results confirm that eelgrass does contribute to carbon storage in Clayoquot Sound but at lower rates than identified for more tropical seagrasses.

With the upcoming era of decommissioning of oil and gas structures, it is timely to assess the usefulness of this footage for researching these communities. We used ROV inspection footage to characterize the sessile invertebrates and fishes associated with the Goodwyn Alpha Production Platform (GWA) on the North West Shelf of Australia between depths of 10 and 125 m during 2006 and 2008. Depth was a major driver of invertebrate assemblages, most likely due to specific requirements such as light, and differences between years were most likely from the physical detachment of species by cyclones and internal waves. Phototrophic species were mostly limited to the upper 50 m of the platform, including the hard coral Pocillopora sp. and the soft corals Nephthea sp. and Scleronephthya sp. In contrast, heterotrophic species including sponges, anemones, bryozoans, hydroids, bivalves such as Lopha folium and the hard coral Tubastrea spp., were distributed across all depths. We observed 1791 fish from at least 10 families and 19 species, including commercial species such as crimson seaperch (Lutjanus erythropterus), red emperor (L. sebae), saddle-tailed seaperch (L. malabaricus), mangrove jack (L. argentimaculatus) and trevally (Caranx spp.). Fish density increased significantly with depth during 2008, from a mean of 23 fish/50 m2 between 10 and 25 m to 3373 fish/50 m2 at 125 m, where small unidentified baitfish were abundant. The highest densities of commercial species occurred between 25 and 75 m depth, suggesting that mid-depth platform sections had high habitat value, a consideration when selecting decommissioning options. The greatest difficulties using the video were the poor lighting and resolution that inhibited our ability to identify sessile species with high taxonomic precision. However, the footage was useful for evaluating high-level biodiversity of the platform, understanding how fish and invertebrate communities changed with depth and comprehending the dynamic nature of the invertebrate community over time. Understanding the habitat value of structures will be necessary for making environmentally sound decommissioning decisions in the future.

A large fraction (>40%) of the NPP of marine ecosystems is decomposed within the system, except for microphytobenthos (decomposition, similar to 25% of NPP). Herbivory tends to be highest for microalgae (planktonic and benthic, >40% of NPP) and macroalgae (33.6+/-4.9% of NPP) and is somewhat less for higher plants. Microphytobenthos export on average a much higher proportion of their NPP than do other microalgal communities, whereas marine macrophytes, except marsh plants, export a substantial proportion (24.3-43.5% on average) of their NPP. The fraction of NPP stored in sediments is 4-fold greater for higher plants (similar to 10-17% of NPP) than for algae (0.4-6% of NPP). On average, similar to 90% of the phytoplankton NPP is used to support local heterotrophic metabolism (i.e. grazed or decomposed). This fraction is even higher in oceanic communities. Mangrove forests, and to a lesser extent seagrass meadows and macroalgal beds, produce organic carbon well in excess of the ecosystem requirements, with excess photosynthetic carbon (i.e. export rate plus storage) in these ecosystems representing similar to 40% of NPP. Extrapolation of these results to the global ocean identifies marine angiosperms, which only contribute 4% of total ocean NPP, as major contributors of the NPP stored (30% of total ocean carbon storage) and subsequently buried in marine sediments. Consideration of burial of NPP from marine angiosperms should lead to estimates of total burial of marine NPP that exceed current estimates by 15-50%.",,,,,,,,,646,18,0,0,490,3,743,,,0024-3590,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-12-01,WOS:A1996WR06100013,,
J,,,,,,,,,"Eckert, Ginny",,Trophic linkages in eelgrass ecosystems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 01 2016,2016,"Seagrass meadows are one of the most widespread habitats in shallow coastal marine environments. They have been dubbed blue carbon ecosystems due to their disproportionately large role in the global capture and storage of carbon (C). The worldwide decline of these coastal vegetated habitats is particularly troubling because C-rich ecosystems provide critical services to humans, such as nutrient cycling and sequestering of carbon, reduce current and wave stress, and supply habitat for fishes, birds and invertebrate species, many of them commercially important. Recent evidence suggests that the top trophic level in these communities, known as apex predators, can play a critical role in preserving vegetated coastal habitats. Apex predators, such as sea otters, can facilitate top-down control in these ecosystems by consuming herbivores such as crabs and fish that are dominant grazers of coastal vegetation. Thus apex predators may indirectly conserve blue carbon stocks by reducing the number of herbivores through predation. This project will use the recolonization of sea otters in Southeast Alaska as a natural experiment to understand the trophic relationships and indirect effects of apex predators on seagrass ecosystems and carbon storage. This research can inform societal decisions on how to manage these ecologically important seagrass communities as the apex predator range expands and sea otter hunting becomes more pervasive. Researchers will engage with Alaska Native villages on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska by training local field assistants and sharing results through regular meetings with various stakeholders in these communities that live with sea otters. This engagement will provide an avenue of communication for researchers and users of marine resources to understand the multifaceted role of sea otters in their ecosystem. The ecological theory that top predators can drive ecosystem structure was developed in response to the question of why the world is green. In short, predators control herbivores, thus regulating the abundance of their plant prey. Through this trophic cascade, predators can play a critical role in maintaining carbon stocks stored by plants. Yet this view is limited to direct effects in the trophic hierarchy and does not consider the indirect role of higher order predators. The trophic linkages between apex predators and intermediate predators, such as crabs and fish that eat grazers, are much less studied. In Southeast Alaska, eelgrass (Zostera marina) is the dominant form of soft sediment nearshore aquatic vegetation and covers nearly 16,000 km of shoreline, which is 1.25 times greater than the entire shoreline of California, Oregon, and Washington combined. The researchers will use the geographical expansion of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) in Southeast Alaska, a region larger than the state of Maine, to investigate the role of apex predators on eelgrass community structure and carbon sequestration at a large temporal and spatial scale. Sea otters were historically distributed throughout the North Pacific and exterminated from northern California to Prince William Sound during the 19th century fur trade. The reintroduction and geographical expansion of sea otters in Southeast Alaska over the past 50 years is a natural experiment that researchers can use to better understand the role of apex predators in structuring marine ecosystems, because sea otter duration and density vary over space, allowing comparison of seagrass food webs along this sea otter gradient. Researchers will rigorously test for a trophic cascade linking apex predators and marine vegetation using this natural experiment combined with manipulative experiments that include alternative hypotheses of what is limiting seagrass and then quantify the role of this seagrass in C sequestration.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1635716,,,,,,,,University of Alaska Fairbanks Campus,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13624042,,

In this paper, we assess the potential risks related to the application of CCS technology and the acidification of aquatic ecosystems through CO2 enrichment. We use the multiple lines of evidence approach (LOEs) to characterize the effects of the acidification with contamination in aquatic sediments. We highlight and discuss the effects of acidification on the LOEs including contamination and mobility of contaminants in sediments, toxicity, macrobenthic community structure, in situ effects, and bioaccumulation biomagnification processes. We further assess the results of acidification on the toxicity of organic contaminants such as antibiotics or illicit drugs like the freebase form of cocaine (crack). The main goal of using the LOE approach is to distinguish between adverse effects that are associated with contaminants and those related to acidification by enrichment of CO2 as a result of CCS technology. Previous assessments were not designed or conducted to incorporate an integrative point of view, nor did they employ a weight of evidence approach (WOE) in risk characterization and management of CCS operations and other situations related to acidification by enrichment of CO2 in the aquatic ecosystem. Based on the findings of this review, the WOE can identify the effects of the acidification on the different LOEs used for sediment quality: contaminant mobility, the adverse effects in organism under laboratory and field conditions, and the bioaccumulation-biomagnification of contaminants. The main strength in using the WOE is the ability of this method to discriminate between LOE responses associated with contamination by different organic and inorganic substances from those related to CO2 acidification itself.

Geotechnical site investigation and foundation design are critical, and often costly, aspects of offshore development, however are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with design forces from the dynamic ocean environment and heterogeneous seafloor geology. Consequently, geotechnical issues have been a key factor in delays and cost overruns for some European offshore wind farms. This research seeks to reduce barriers to offshore renewable energy development associated with design and construction of foundation systems for floating technologies such as tidal, wave, ocean current, and deep water wind through advancement of a novel integrated foundation system for multi-device developments. This novel system is comprised of a network of interconnected suction caissons, which are large diameter, hollow cylinder, closed cap, pile-type foundations named for their installation by internal underpressure (i.e., suction) developed during pumping of water from the gap formed between the seafloor and cap. When used in an interconnected network to moor multiple devices, suction caissons have the potential to significantly alleviate development costs by reducing the total number of installed foundations. This goal of this research is develop the basic engineering knowledge necessary to transform the use of offshore suction caissons in clay soils from single to networked, multi-line mooring anchors. This research will lead to development of three dimensional numerical models used to predict ultimate capacity and deformation of a suction caisson under taut, orthogonal multi-line loading. The models will be calibrated/validated using both published literature and results from a physical modeling study of multi-line caisson behavior under monotonic and cyclic loading previously conducted by the principal investigator. The model will be further developed to investigate the effects of vertical load attachment point, number of lines and radial attachment angles, and load inclination with respect to caisson height on predicted capacity. This research effort will result in numerical modeling and analysis tools that will allow for continued investigation of multi-line loaded suction caisson capacity for a variety of offshore applications.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1234847,,,,,,,,University of Maine,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13773764,,

Additionally, we analyzed how the social and ecological characteristics in coastal areas interact with conservation and development policies by using this approach. We found strong negative associations between the habitat risks and ecosystem services (aquaculture, carbon storage, recreation, and aesthetic quality) across the coastal counties. Our results showed that the intensity of the habitat risks and the provision of ecosystem services were significantly different between reclamation-dominated and conservation-dominated counties, except for coastal vulnerability.

The ecosystem services approach provided guidelines to achieve both sustainable development and environment conservation.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is part of the suite of technologies that will contribute to lowering atmospheric emissions of CO2 from Australia's energy system. There are a wide variety of technologies at various stages of technical and commercial readiness, with more development underway for cost effective CO2 capture and storage. Our research will provide new knowledge to inform cost-efficient measurement, monitoring and verification (MMV) of the environment of CCS projects in coastal waters. --o-- [NOTE: this record is only for the video and image data] Nineteen 750 m towed video transects were completed. Site locations were chosen to coincide with dive locations to be surveyed on the second voyage in April 2018. To ensure video transects intersected seabed features of interest (dunes), transects were oriented parallel to the shore line (NE to SE), perpendicular to the dunes. Data feeds included HD video, still images of the seafloor (5s intervals) and water quality information from an ecotriplet, CTD and LiCor instrument. Habitat characteristics were characterised using the video and Tappity underway classification system. The system performed well with no issues except an occasional intermittent GPS feed and slight over exposure in the still images. Water visibility was variable and generally more turbid inshore where there were high densities of gelatinous matter in the water column near the seabad (<5 m visibility). Although this level of visibility reduced the ability to see the seafloor in the video substantially, the broad level habitat classifications provided by the Tappitty system are considered reliable. Habitat characteristics were largely as expected with 15 of the 19 sites dominated by course to medium sand, sparse seagrass and drifting macroalgae. The four remaining sites were dominated by low relief reef with Ecklonia, low-foliose macoalgae, sponges and gorgonians. Sand and sparse seagrass habitats tended to be located offshore and the low relief reef sites tended to be located inshore and toward the northern boundary of the survey area i.e. sites 2,17,13,14.

A terrestrial 3D laser scanner was used to acquire data of the sediment surface around the foundation structure. Tests have been conducted systematically varying from wave- to current-dominated conditions. Different volume analyzing methods are introduced, which can be related for any offshore or coastal structure to disclose physical processes in complex erosion patterns. Empirical formulations are proposed for the quantification of spatially eroded sediment volumes and scour depths in the near-field and vicinity of the structure. Findings from the present study agree well with in-situ data stemming from the field. Contrasting spatial erosion development between experimental and in-situ data determines a stable maximum of erosion intensity at a distance of 1.25 A, 1.25 times the structure's footprint A, as well as a global scour extent of 2.1-2.7 A within the present study and about 2.7-2.8 A from the field.

Volume 1.,,,,,,,,137,154,,,,,,,,,,,Book chapter,2004,2004,"The status of coral reefs and coral communities in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden is generally good, with coral cover averaging 20-50%. This includes decreases and increases in live coral cover since 2002. The 1998 bleaching event caused major damage on parts of the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, but caused no damage in the northern Red Sea; in some areas the recovery has been strong, and weak in others. Recent outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) have occurred in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Djibouti and western Somalia, along with some local bleaching. Threats to coral reefs differ in the region, but are increasing with the increasing rate of coastal development. The major local threats include land fills, dredging, sedimentation, sewage discharge and effluents from desalination plants, mostly around towns, cities and tourist development sites. There is local reef damage around major tourism areas, caused by people and boat anchors, along with other threats. Fish populations are declining in some areas, because of increased demand for and fishing pressure on food and ornamental species. Destructive fishing practices such as trawling in fragile habitats is increasing. There has been an influx of illegal fishing vessels seeking to meet demands of the export market and more affluent and growing populations locally. The other major threats are from pollution and shipping accidents, and future bleaching. Monitoring these reefs is becoming increasingly important, as climate change and warmer waters near the limits for coral growth. Most countries have enacted national legislation for coral reef conservation, and signed multinational agreements with assistance from the Regional Organisation for the Conservation of the Environment of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden (PERSGA). However, these laws are either poorly implemented or enforced and often are ignored completely. The main need is to enforce national and international laws, develop public awareness programs and adopt sustainable management strategies. This will require long-term strategies for capacity building. PERSGA developed a Strategic Action Program in 1998 and a Regional Action Plan in 2003 for reef conservation. The plan aims to reduce impacts with: Integrated Coastal Management; Education and Awareness; Marine Protected Areas; Ecologically Sustainable Reef Fisheries; Shipping and Marine Pollution control; and Research, Monitoring and Economic Valuation. Several major new MPAs are being developed in Djibouti, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen. Management of existing MPAs in a number of countries, including Egypt and Yemen, has improved, with support from the Global Environment Facility and bilateral donors. A UNDP/GEF Coastal, Marine and Island Biodiversity Project is starting in Eritrea. 100 years ago: Following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the region was a major international shipping route with occasional shipwrecks and related oil spills. There were invasions of alien species but damage from human activities was minimal. There were some artisanal fishers but fishing pressure was low and fish stocks were largely unexploited. The reefs were predominantly healthy. In 1994: Most reefs were in good condition, with sustainable levels of fishing and low levels of human damage, except near towns, cities and tourist sites. Some reefs were affected by COTS outbreaks in the 1970s, and bleaching in the early 1990s. In 2004: Urban growth, coastal land reclamation and fisheries are expanding, and COTS outbreaks are continuing. Tourism continues to expand in some countries, but not others. There has been strong recovery of some reefs badly damaged by the 1998 bleaching event, but others have shown no recovery. There has been some success in establishing MPAs, but there is no effective regional MPA network, and most of the declared MPAs have ineffective management. Predictions for 2014: Pressures will increase from: major development for mass tourism and industrialisation; over-exploitation and destructive fishing in poorly managed fisheries; COTS outbreaks; and bleaching events. Over-exploitation of fish throughout much of the region will pose a more serious threat, unless regulations are strengthened and enforcement improved. Further large-scale bleaching events, like that of 1998, may prove catastrophic to stressed coral reefs in the Gulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. These impacts will probably lead to decreases in the health and extent of reefs, reduce their renewable goods and services, and lower natural recovery. However many reefs in the region will remain healthy, particularly those remote from development or with strong currents or cool upwellings.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,20,0,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2004-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14105030660,,

Monitoring was performed during routine O&G industrial operations for underwater noise mitigation purposes, and to ensure adherence to regulatory guidelines. Incidental sightings by off-effort MMOs and installation crew were also reported. Visual and acoustic monitoring spanned 55 non-consecutive days between 2004 and 2014. A total of 47 marine mammal sightings were recorded by MMOs on dedicated watch, and 10 incidental sightings of marine megafauna were reported over 10 years. Species included: harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus), white beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris), common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), common seal (Phoca vitulina), grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) and, basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). Passive Acoustic Monitoring was conducted on two occasions in 2014; 160 PAM hours over 12 days recorded a total of 308 individual clicks identified as harbour porpoises. These appear to be the first such acoustic detections obtained from a North Sea drilling rig whilst using a typically configured hydrophone array designed for towing in combination with real-time PAMGuard software. This study provides evidence that marine megafauna are present around mobile and stationary offshore O&G installations during routine operational activities. On this basis, Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for decommissioning O&G platforms should be carried-out on a case-by-case basis, and must include provisions for hitherto overlooked marine megafauna.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,23,0,24,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Sci Consulting, Ocean House,4 Brewery Lane, Dunbar, East Lothian, EnglandUniv Southampton, Inst Sound & Vibrat Res, Highfield, Hants, England",Ocean Sci Consulting,,,2016-04-14,WOS:000374131700038,27078153,

Two Response Surface Models (RSMs) were derived based on compressive strength tests and expansion measurements on FG-based blend cylindrical samples after 28-day curing. The developed RSMs allow accurate prediction of the compressive strength and volumetric expansion as functions of the relative content in weight of different components in the FG-based blend material. Using these RSMs, a composition with promising strength and durability properties was identified. Additional mechanical and physical properties that are significant for structural applications were also investigated experimentally for this composition, confirming that the select composition could be a promising substitute for ordinary concrete and/or limestone. The effects of environmental actions on the mechanical and durability properties of the FG-based blend were investigated by immersing samples in seawater for a period of one year. The results of this experimental investigation suggest that the developed FG-based blend is a promising material for underwater applications (e.g., as oyster cultch) and coastal protection structures (e.g., for the construction of artificial reefs and breakwaters), at a significantly lower cost than other materials commonly used for the construction of these structures. Additionally, the unit weight of the proposed material is significantly lower than that of ordinary concrete and limestone, which contributes to a longer life span of the underwater structure by reducing its sinking rate into the soft soil typically found, e.g., in the US Gulf Coast region.",,,,,Conference on OCEANSConference on OCEANS,"SEP 18-21, 2017SEP 18-21, 2017",,"Anchorage, AKAnchorage, AK",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0197-7385,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2017-01-01,WOS:000455012000139,,

The paddle moves back and forth with the waves to convert kinetic wave energy into electricity through a submerged power-take-off unit. The electricity is used to grow artificial reefs using an electrolytic process that transforms natural minerals found in seawater into rock on which the coral proliferates alternatively it can be used to power local communities.Many of the components within the power-take-off unit of the CCell wave-energy converter generate heat due to inherent inefficiencies. Some of these components are also temperature sensitive and vital to the proper operation of the device. The heat generated by the power components lead to the possibility of the electronics overheating, particularly when this is also coupled with the high sea temperatures found in the intended deployment areas, such as the Mayan Riviera in Mexico, where sea temperatures reach 35 °C and hurricanes frequently occur.

Recently, coastal blue carbon habitats-mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows-have received attention for their ability to capture CO2 and store organic carbon (OC), primarily in their sediments. Across habitat types and regions, however, information about the sequestration rates and sources of carbon to local sediments remains sparse. Here we compiled recently obtained estimates of sediment OC stocks and sequestration rates from 139 cores collected from temperate seagrass (Zostera marina) meadows in Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. Across all cores sediment OC content averaged 0.75%. Organic carbon stocks in the top 25 cm and 1 m of the sediment averaged 1,846 and 7,168 g OC m(-2), respectively. Carbon sequestration rates ranged from 4.6 to 93.0 g OCm-2 y(r-1) and averaged 24.8 g OC m(-2) yr(-1). Isotopic data from this region suggest that OC in the sediments is largely from noneelgrass sources. In general, these values are comparable to those from other temperate Z. marina meadows, but significantly lower than previously reported values for seagrasses globally. These results further highlight the need for local and species-level quantification of blue carbon parameters. While temperate eelgrass meadows may not sequester and store as much carbon as seagrass meadows elsewhere, climate policy incentives should still be implemented to protect existing sediment carbon stocks and the other critical ecosystem services associated with eelgrass habitats.",,,,,,,,,34,1,0,0,21,0,42,,,0886-6236,1944-9224,,,,,,,,,,"Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC, CanadaHakai Inst, Tula Fdn, Nearshore Ecol, Heriot Bay, BC, CanadaWestern Washington Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Bellingham, WA 98225 USAUniv Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USAUniv Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK USAComox Valley Project Watershed, Courtenay, BC, CanadaRoyal Rd Univ, Environm & Sustainabil, Victoria, BC, CanadaPadilla Bay Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Mt Vernon, IA USAUniv New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources, Jackson Estuarine Lab, Durham, NH 03824 USAWashington State Dept Nat Resources, Olympia, WA USASouth Slough Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Coos Bay, OR USA",Comox Valley Project WatershedRoyal Rd UnivPadilla Bay Natl Estuarine Res ReserveWashington State Dept Nat ResourcesSouth Slough Natl Estuarine Res Reserve,,,2020-02-01,WOS:000520158900002,,

Furthermore, mortality of small size classes (0-1 cm) was significantly increased in treatment levels >= 6,600 mu atm. First signs of external shell dissolution became visible at >= 1,500 mu atm, holes were observed at > 6,600 mu atm. C. edule body condition decreased significantly at all treatment levels (1,500-24,400 mu atm). Dominant meiofauna taxa remained unaffected in abundance. Densities of calcifying meiofauna taxa (i.e. Gastropoda and Ostracoda) decreased in high CO2 treatments (> 6,600 mu atm), while the non - calcifying Gastrotricha significantly increased in abundance at 24,400 mu atm.

The Deepwater Horizon oil spill natural resource damage assessment documented injury as a result of the oiling of over 2113 km (1300 miles) of shoreline over an 87 d release from the wellhead. Field and laboratory studies indicate that oil degraded the health of coastal marsh vegetation and associated fauna, resulted in the loss of nearshore oyster cover, and increased erosion of oiled marsh edge habitat over approximately 174 km (108 miles) of shoreline. Sand beach habitat, submersed aquatic vegetation, and subtidal oysters were injured by a combination of oiling and response actions. The loss of billions of oysters resulted in failed recruitment over several years in the most severely affected areas (Barataria Bay, Black Bay/Breton Sound, and Mississippi Sound). Affected ecosystem services include supporting services (e.g. primary production) and provisioning services (e.g. fish and invertebrate abundance). Loss of vegetation and nearshore oysters and increased shoreline erosion may have disrupted regulating services associated with stable marsh (e.g. coastal storm and flood protection). The loss of marsh vegetation and oysters likely reduced nutrient cycling and water filtration services. Recovery of natural resources may take more than 20 yr in some areas. To prepare for future spills, we recommend that natural resource trustees develop generic conceptual models and prepare integrated injury assessment approaches for nearshore habitats to facilitate future injury quantification. Additional exploration of the trade-offs between response options could minimize or shift natural resource injury for future spills.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,18,0,23,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Off Response & Restorat, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USAInd Econ Inc, 2067 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA",,,,2017-09-12,WOS:000407443900017,,

Using carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, seawater was acidified to pH 7.3 (mimicking ocean acidification), 6.5 or 5.6 (mimicking leakage from a sub-seabed CO2 store site). Control treatments were maintained in natural seawater [pH approximate to 8.0). Exposure to acidified seawater significantly altered community structure and reduced diversity for both macrofaunal and nematode assemblages, However, the impact on nematodes was less severe than that on macrofauna. While the communities in both sediment types were significantly affected by changes in seawater pH, impacts on sandy sediment fauna were greater than those on muddy sediment fauna. Sandy sediments also showed the greatest effects with respect to nutrient fluxes. In sand, the efflux of nitrite, nitrate and silicate decreased in response to increased acidification while the efflux of ammonium increased, In mud, acidification increased the efflux of ammonium but had no effect on the other nutrients.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Improving detection and estimation of birds collision risk with energy infrastructure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2018,2018,"New tracking technologies have enabled researchers to unravel previously unknown animal movement strategies and migratory routes. The use of animal tracking devices that collect high temporal and spatial precision data, including altitude information has been increasing in recent years. Altitude data is necessary to estimate birds' collision risk with offshore wind turbines, electricity cables or other energy infrastructure. This information is key and part of the decision-making process for proposed renewable developments. Areas with high collision risk should be avoided. This project has two components, first it will examine existing animal movement data, from devices that provide accurate elevation information and will examine bird collision risk with the energy infrastructure in Europe. This is important to identify areas with high collision risk that need mitigation actions. The second part of the project will focus on the development of new technology to determine when a bird actually collides. The devices will be tested during the PhD and the results of this project will open new avenues for identification of risk of collision, an issue that is increasing in importance worldwide. We will use data on the movement of migratory birds from a variety of projects freely available on Movebank. Movement characteristics (altitude, speed, direction, flight type and distance moved) will be used to determine locations of high collision risk. This project will also take advantage of existing high temporal and spatial resolution data from ~80 white storks and will use newly developed features to identify collision events. The student will be involved in the development of the new features. The collision risk with energy infrastructure will be determined using GIS approaches. The student will benefit from the expertise in data analyses and field techniques provided by the supervisory team and collaborating partners.The NEXUSS CDT provides state-of-the-art, highly experiential training in the application and development of cutting-edge Smart and Autonomous Observing Systems for the environmental sciences, alongside comprehensive personal and professional development. There will be extensive opportunities for students to expand their multi-disciplinary outlook through interactions with a wide network of academic, research and industrial / government / policy partners. This project will train the PhD student on the interface between ecology and engineering. The student will be involved in assembling and testing tracking devices, and will be able to assess their performance in lab conditions and in the field, by deploying the devices on birds. - Assembling testing tracking devices (HWU and UEA)- Deployment of tracking devices storks (UK/Portugal)- Movement and behavior data analyses and interpretation (UEA)- GIS analyses of the collision risk (UEA).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2180545,,,,,,,,University of East Anglia,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15337650,,

We analysed 2 decades of at sea movement data and terrestrial count data from these species to produce high resolution, broad-scale maps of distribution and associated uncertainty to inform conservation and management. Our results showed that grey seals use offshore areas connected to their haul-out sites by prominent corridors, and harbour seals primarily stay within 50 km of the coastline. Both species show fine-scale offshore spatial segregation off the east coast of Britain and broad-scale partitioning off western Scotland. These results illustrate that, for broad-scale marine spatial planning, the conservation needs of harbour seals (primarily inshore, the exception being selected offshore usage areas) are different from those of grey seals (up to 100 km offshore and corridors connecting these areas to haul-out sites).

The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) recognises two populations of Northern Bottlenose Whales in Canada: the Scotian Shelf population and the Davis Strait-Baffin Bay-Labrador Sea population. The Davis Strait population was designated Not at Risk by COSEWIC in 1993. The Scotian Shelf population was assessed as Endangered in 2002 and added to Schedule 1 of the Species at Risk Act (SARA) in 2006. In 2011, COSEWIC reassessed both populations and designated the Scotian Shelf population as Endangered and the Davis Strait population as Special Concern. In anticipation of this assessment, Fisheries and Oceans Canada conducted a Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA) in November 2010. This RPA will inform the SARA listing decision by the federal Governor in Council, socio-economic analyses, and consultations with the public. The RPA will also inform the recovery strategy(ies) of Northern Bottlenose Whale populations listed as Threatened or Endangered under the SARA. The most recent published population estimate (average population estimate for the 1988 to 2003 period) for the Scotian Shelf is 163 individuals. There was no trend in abundance during that period. This population ranges from Georges Bank to the eastern Scotian Shelf; however, the majority of sightings are highly aggregated in the Gully, Haldimand Canyon, and Shortland Canyon. There is no evidence that range has decreased. There is no estimate of abundance for the Davis Strait population. Vessel-based and aerial survey efforts yielded few sightings between 2003 and 2007. It is likely that this long-lived species is still recovering from whaling. This population ranges from the Labrador Sea to southern Baffin Bay. Sightings are aggregated in the deep waters of the Davis Strait along the shelf edge, from the mouth of Hudson Strait to the mouth of Cumberland Sound. The whales' primary prey item is deepwater squid from the genus Gonatus. Northern Bottlenose Whale habitat is characterised by waters of more than 500 metres in bottom depth, particularly around steep-sided features, which provide access to sufficient accumulations of Gonatus squid. Zone 1 of the Gully Marine Protected Area and areas with water depths greater than 500 metres in Haldimand and Shortland canyons have been declared Critical Habitat for the Scotian Shelf population. Northern Bottlenose Whales do not have any known dwelling-place similar to a den or nest during any part of their life cycle; hence, the concept of residence does not apply. The main human-induced threats are anthropogenic ocean noise (particularly from oil and gas exploration and extraction) and entanglement/bycatch in fishing gear. The latter is the only documented source of human-induced harm or mortality in Canada. Potential mitigation measures include education of members of the fishing industry on safe handling and release techniques and on the risks to nearby feeding whales. Area closures could be used should areas of high entanglement risk be identified.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1499-3848; 1919-5044,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2013-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15303017943,,

The focus is on the western and Arabian coasts; the eastern (Iranian) coast remains one of the least known in the world in biological terms. Of the subtidal ecosystems, coral reefs are the most diverse. They are highly productive, but cover only a small area and so are of relatively minor importance in a regional sense. Seagrasses are common in shallow areas (< 10 m), forming the basis of many food chains. At least four seagrass species are known for the region, but most communities are dominated by Halodule uninervis. Seagrasses are also an important habitat for commercial shrimp (e.g. Penaeus semisulcatus), pearl oysters and many other organisms. Mudflats occupy extensive areas of the intertidal zone. Their productivity is often enhanced by Cyanophya-dominated algal mats. Naturally occurring mangroves are found in association with tidal flats and are represented by a single species, Avicennia marina. Mangroves are much less extensive in the Gulf (125-130 km2) than the Red Sea (400-500 km2).Of major regional and global importance are the Gulf's fisheries, particularly for penaeid shrimp (eg.

High-reward tagging studies offer a simple and direct approach to estimating exploitation rates at these various scales and in examining how model parameters impact exploitation rate estimates. These methods can ultimately provide a better understanding of the spatial dynamics of exploitation at smaller local and regional scales within a fishery-a measure often needed for more site-attached species, such as the Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus. We used this approach to tag 724 Red Snapper during 2016 in the Alabama Artificial Reef Zone within the northern Gulf of Mexico to estimate recreational exploitation rates in Alabama waters. We fitted a series of tag return models, analyzed using maximum likelihood, to examine how release depth, movement between depth strata, fish length, and the rate at which anglers released fish impacted estimates of exploitation rate under a range of assumed natural and tagging mortality rates. Our model results suggested higher fishing mortality in the shallower depth stratum than in the deep stratum, constant movement rates with release depth, and constant release rates across fish lengths. Exploitation rate for the aggregate tagged population across the entire sample area was estimated at 0.14. Exploitation rates estimated for each depth stratum were 0.20 (shallow stratum: <36.5 m) and 0.06 (deep stratum: 36.5-61.0 m). In addition, length-based vulnerability to harvest was dome-shaped, with peak exploitation rates of 0.37 (shallow stratum) and 0.12 (deep stratum) occurring at 600-700 mm TL. Although previous studies have suggested higher exploitation rates in shallower waters compared to deeper waters, few estimates exist at these smaller spatial scales.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,1942-5120,,,,,,,,,,,"Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 203 Swingle Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USAUniv S Alabama, Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dept Marine Sci, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USAMississippi State Univ, Coastal Res & Extens Ctr, 1815 Popps Ferry Rd, Biloxi, MS 39532 USA",,,,2019-01-10,WOS:000454411800002,,

The windfarm comprises 91 6.3 MW turbines and two substations with total installed power of 573 MW. Construction work is scheduled for 2016/17. The windfarm is located in UK waters in the southern part of the North Sea about 30 km north of the Norfolk coastline and 30 km east of Lincolnshire. The Race Bank site has a diverse morphology located on large sandbanks with mobile sandwaves and megaripples and intersected by deeper featureless swales where clay soil formations are found close to or at the sea floor. The morphological complexity of the site was recognised early in the project development and numerous bathymetric surveys have been undertaken to help quantify sandwave migration rates and expected seabed variability. Morphological seabed assessments have been conducted by ABPmer throughout the project development. In the detailed design phase the ABPmer assessments have been combined with in-house DONG Energy analysis to provide design seabed levels and anticipated ranges of natural seabed changes within the lifetime of the windfarm. The paper presents an overall morphological characterisation of the windfarm site and provides examples of the very diverse seabed morphology encountered. When quantified, the morphological diversity can be absorbed in the monopile foundation design and cable installation contractors can select appropriate installation tools. The paper thus comes with a recommendation to ensure that bathymetric surveys in morphological active sites are carried out early and repeatedly during the project development stages.",,,,,8th International Conference on Scour and Erosion (ICSE)8th International Conference on Scour and Erosion (ICSE),"SEP 12-15, 2016SEP 12-15, 2016",HR WallingfordHR Wallingford,"Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Andrew Wiles Bldg, Oxford, ENGLANDUniv Oxford, Math Inst, Andrew Wiles Bldg, Oxford, ENGLAND",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-315-37504-5; 978-1-138-02979-8,,,,,,,,,"DONG Energy AS, Gentofte, DenmarkABP Marine Environm Res Ltd, Southampton, Hants, England",DONG Energy ASABP Marine Environm Res Ltd,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000629488100025,,

Here, we quantified the ecological dynamics of invasion by a corallimorph, Rhodactis howesii, at Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific. A localized outbreak of this species was first observed following a shipwreck at Palmyra in 1991 and has subsequently spread across hectares, reaching 100% cover in some areas. We examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of this invasion, and its impact on the benthic community, using a combination of permanent photoquadrats and large-scale photomosaic imagery. Our data revealed two distinct patterns in the spatial dynamics of R. howesii on the reef. First, following the removal of the shipwreck in 2013, the cover of the corallimorph in the immediate vicinity of the wreck decreased markedly, with crustose coralline algae (CCA), an important reef-builder, dominating the newly available substrate. However, in contrast to the decline at the epicenter of the invasion, the corallimorph has spread to additional sites around the atoll where increases in abundance have been associated with decreases in hard coral cover. Reductions in percent cover and corallimorph patch size near the epicenter of the outbreak, coupled with increases in cover and patch size and appearance of the corallimorph at other locations around Palmyra, demonstrate the dynamic nature of this invasion. Further, we found that the corallimorph settled disproportionately often on patches of turf or CCA cover, but can then overgrow all benthic competitors following establishment. This study provides evidence that R. howesii has the capacity to be highly invasive on coral reefs and highlights the importance of large-scale, long-term monitoring efforts to capture the dynamic nature of such invasions.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,12,0,17,,,0722-4028,1432-0975,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USASmithsonian Marine Stn, Ft Pierce, FL 34949 USAUniv Calif Davis, Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,,,2019-11-28,WOS:000496024100015,,

Coastal areas are home to increasing numbers of people and population growth is expected to continue, putting TCMEs under pressure from development as well as broader environmental changes associated with climate change, e.g. sea level rise and ocean acidification. Attention to TCMEs by conservation organizations has increased and although a variety of interventions to promote conservation and sustainable development of TCMEs have been implemented, evidence regarding the outcomes of these-for people or ecosystems-is scattered and unclear. This study takes a systematic mapping approach to identify articles that examine the ecological and social outcomes associated with conservation interventions in TCMEs; specifically in coral reef, mangrove, and seagrass habitats. Methods We developed a comprehensive framework of conservation interventions and outcomes, drawing on existing frameworks and related evidence synthesis projects, as well as interviews with marine conservation practitioners. We modified existing frameworks to: (i) include features of TCME that are not fully captured in existing frameworks; and (ii) further specify and/or regroup existing interventions or outcomes. We developed a search string informed by habitat, geography, interventions, and outcomes of interest, to search the peer-reviewed primary literature in four bibliographic databases and the grey literature on relevant institutional websites. All searches will be conducted in English. We will screen returned articles at the title and abstract level. Included articles will be screened at full text level and data coding will follow. Number of articles and reasons for excluding at full text level screening will be recorded. At each phase (title and abstract screening, full text screening, data coding), articles will be assessed independently by two members of the review team. Coded data will be reported in a narrative review and a database accessible through an open access, searchable data portal. We will summarize trends in the evidence base, identify interventions and outcomes where evidence can be further assessed in subsequent systematic reviews and where gaps in the literature exist, and discuss the implications of research gaps and gluts for TCME conservation policy, practice, and future research.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,0,13,,,,2047-2382,,,,,,,,,,"Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm, 135 Duke Marine Lab Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USAAmer Museum Nat Hist, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, 200 Cent Pk West, New York, NY 10012 USAWorld Wildlife Fund US, Ocean Conservat, 1250 24th St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USAWorld Wildlife Fund US, Global Sci, 1250 24th St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA",World Wildlife Fund USWorld Wildlife Fund US,,,2020-06-10,WOS:000536132500001,,

A theoretical framework has been developed and applied to create a model for UK seas to measure changes in final ecosystem services, in terms of human welfare. The model that has been developed is explicitly spatial and temporal to facilitate its use in supporting marine planning decisions. The development and application of this framework to UK seas necessarily requires many assumptions to be made. The paper describes the development and population of the framework and discusses the practical limitations and challenges in seeking to develop and apply such models. Significant differences in long-term values of different services were identified under the different scenarios. All scenarios highlight the projected decline in oil and gas revenues which provide particular intense values at sites of extraction. These values are partially replaced by revenues from offshore renewables in some of the scenarios. Values associated with carbon sequestration, maritime transport, tourism and pollution assimilation are also very significant but more spatially diffuse. The study has demonstrated that it is possible to develop spatio-temporal models to evaluate changes in final ecosystem service benefits using existing data, although the approach necessarily requires many assumptions to be made.

Laboratory-scale experiments were performed to provide data on the possible effects of CO2 leakage from CCS on the mobility of metals previously trapped in sediments. Metal-contaminated sediments were collected and submitted to acidification by means of CO2 injection using different pH treatments. The test lasted 10 days, and samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of the experiment for metal analysis. The results revealed increases in the mobility of metals such as Co, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn due to pH decreases. Geochemical modeling demonstrated that acidification influenced the speciation of the metals, increasing the concentrations of their free forms. These data suggest the possible sediment contamination consequences of accidental CO2 leakage during CCS activities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Three different mixtures of the materials used, pulverized fuel ash (PFA), flue gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum and FGD slurry, were stabilized with cement. Fifty tons of 40 X 20 X 20 cm blocks were formed into eight conical reef units, 1 m high, replicating three different PFA/gypsum mixtures and concrete controls. A concern arising from the use of such materials is that the heavy metals concentrated by the combustion of coal, and remaining in the ash, may leach out. The heavy metal content (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni, Zn) of the blocks has been monitored from both surface samples and sectioned cores to determine leaching rates. There have been no significant changes in heavy metal concentrations to date, any temporal or spatial variation being within limits attributable to material heterogeneity. However there is some indication of a trend in block depth profiles suggesting either internal redistribution or surface loss of cadmium (less than 5% total) and surface enrichment by manganese and chromium. Replacement of calcium by magnesium is evident in the surface 2-4 cm of the blocks. No evidence for further change was seen between block sections taken after 18 and 27 months immersion suggesting that surface diffusion changes reduce with time and indicating long term stability. A rich epifauna and flora quickly developed on the reef blocks. The heavy metal content of epibiota on the ash blocks has been compared to that on the concrete, surrounding seabed and local natural reefs. The organisms analyzed included: red algae, Calliblepharis; hydroids, Halecium halecinum; bryozoans, Bugula spp.; sponges, Scypha ciliata; ascidians, Ascidia mentula. Molluscs, Ostrea edulis, and their predator the gastropod, Ocenebra erinacea, were also examined. No evidence of excess bioaccumulation of cadmium, chromium and manganese has been detected. Increasing metal concentrations in ascidians related to elevated water column concentrations are shown by comparison of the Poole Bay natural and artificial reef samples with those taken from nearby Poole Harbour, which is partially urbanized.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,0,15,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,"FAWLEY AQUAT RES LABS LTD,MARINE & FRESHWATER BIOL UNIT,NATL POWER,SOUTHAMPTON SO4 2AA,HANTS,ENGLAND",FAWLEY AQUAT RES LABS LTD,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400080,,

We assessed Indo-Pacific barrel sponge demography with a focus on specific growth rate (SGR), density, and mean volume across four sites of varying habitat quality. Four growth models were compared using Akaike's Information Criterion using a multi-model inference approach. Age was extrapolated and validated based on sponge size on a shipwreck of known age. Sponges from different sites showed differences in density, volume gained, and mean volume, but not growth rates. Interestingly, SGRs were slightly slower than that of X. muta, yet growth models supported rapid growth; Indo-Pacific sponges were over twice as old as published estimates of comparably sized X. muta (53-55 as compared to 23 years of age, respectively), although extrapolation errors are likely to increase with sponge size.

To clear up geological-paleooceanographic conditions of sediment-lithogenesis of the MesozoicCenozoic deposits of the Carpathian-Black Sea continental margin of the Tethys. Methodology. Multi-aspect complex approach of diagnostics of paleosedimentation environments includes comparative-lithologic, lithofacial, lithmological, facial-genetic and mineralogy-petrographic analyses. Results. In this work the primary fundamental problem of modern geology. i.e.: formation and evolution of sedimentary complexes of ancient continental margins has been reviewed. A series of geological-paleooceanographic models of sedimentation environments has been made and sedimentary associations for specific ages of the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic Carpathian-Black Sea continental margin of the Tethys have been distinguished. Regional features of space-age spread of terrigenous, carbonaceous, siliceous, volcanic and mixed sediments of the Late Jurassic, Early and Late Cretaceous, Eocene and Oligocene-Early Miocene ages have been characterized. In addition to that sedimentary formations associated with both the first (shelf carbonate bank-reef and terrigenous alluvial delta formations) and the second level of sedimentation (fen's foot of the continental slopes, the formation of mesopelagic plains) have been localized. Originality. Geological-paleooceanographic models allowed to recreate a complete picture of the evolution of sedimentation processes influenced paleooceanographic complex factors such as eustatic changes in sea level, global anoxic events, etc. The proposed concept of the evolution of the Carpathian-Black Sea continental margin of the Tethys in terms of processes of avalanche sedimentation on various structural levels, namely on the shelf and at the foot of the continental slope, allowed in a new way to explain the formation of these sedimentary strata, where the sea level fluctuations controlled distribution of sedimentary material between epipelagic and mesopelagic parts of basins. Practical significance. Sedimentary formations associated with both the first (shelf carbonate bank-reef and terrigenous alluvial delta formations) and the second level of avalanche sedimentation (fen's foot of the continental slopes) have been established. These sediment accumulation bodies represent important objects prospective for oil and gas in the ancient and modern sedimentary basins of the oceans. Identification of these formations within the ancient Carpathian-Black Sea continental margin of the Tethys provides new data on the oil and gas bearing potential of the region.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1992-142X,2519-2663,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Ukrainian Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geochem Combustible Minerals, 3-A,Naukova Str, Lvov, Ukraine",,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000442295700007,,

Using state-of-the-art remotely operated vehicles to survey the seabed, the team captured more than 250,000 high-definition (HD) photographs; hundreds of hours of ultra high-definition (UHD) video together with acoustic bathymetric, laser, side-scan sonar and seismic data. The wrecks were located in depths from 40 to 2200 m - those shipwrecks in the deeper range presented extraordinary archaeological preservation due to the Black Sea's anoxic conditions. This paper will introduce the range of deep-sea optic and acoustic survey techniques to accurately record and create 3D and pseudo 4D models of the shipwrecks. It will focus on a Early 4th Century BC shipwreck demonstrating the project's survey strategy as well as adaptations developed in response to operational conditions; the implementation of deep sea robotics to generate georeferenced high-resolution photogrammetric models and the benefits this has as an on-site, as well as a post-cruise, interpretative tool. It demonstrates that in-theatre acquisition and processing of high-quality datasets is a working reality and has fundamental implications for management as well as the advantages that this brings to the archaeological research process: Firstly, in the creation of spatio-temporal models, i.e., 4D representations of a site pre and post archaeological excavation and secondly, in monitoring such wreck sites, and provides a viable non-intervention tool for the assessment of sites as part of a long-term management strategy.

HVDC allows electric power to be transmitled over large distances with relatively fewer losses and without the stability problems of HVAC (High Voltage Alternate Current). Multi-terminal HVDC has often been proposed as a possibility for a European super-grid or connecting a large number of offshore wind farms, and has similar applications in large countries such as Brazil, which has significant hydro-resources away from centres of population. In conventional HVDC point-to-point links, the circuit breakers reside on the AC side, and in the event of fault, the entire link is de-energised. In the multi- terminal case however, it is more desirable to isolate only the faulted link rather than trip the entire DC grid. Not only does this require DC breakers, but also a DC protection relay that will discern when to operate the breakers. This project will investigate the feasibility of novel methods for DC protection relays, particularly combining the use of high frequency post fault information and AI inference engines such as Neural Networks and Fuzzy systems.

Despite the sharp division that exists in stakeholder opinion, particularly related to whether or not such a concept constitutes an act of dumping, there now exists a proactive approach to assessing the need and potential for the formation of reefs using redundant oil and gas platforms. One influential stakeholder, Greenpeace, however, has distanced itself from the process. Liability, loss of access, and safety are of particular concern to fishermen when examining calls for offshore and nearshore reefs. The fishing industry remains unconvinced of the benefits of inshore reefs but maintains an open mind. It remains, however, committed in opposition to offshore reef creation, even more so when suggested in combination with a no fishing policy. The environmental pressure group Greenpeace is opposed to any rigs-to-reefs initiative, seeing this as a means by which offshore operators can circumvent the Oslo and Paris Commission's (OSPAR) Decision 98/3, which calls for complete removal of offshore installations. The importance of cost and the existence of willing reef beneficiaries are highlighted as important to the acceptance and success of a nearshore rigs-to-reefs venture.

The importance of a genuine stakeholder dialogue process to integrate scientific and political thinking and to avoid the re-occurrence of an event similar to the Brent Spar is stressed.

Drifting FAD associated fishes from both equatorial (Seychelles) and tropical waters (Reunion Island) were examined by divers. A total of 32 species (belonging to 16 families) were observed associated with drifting FADs in equatorial waters, and 24 species (14 families) were found around FADs in tropical waters. Twenty species were found in both regions. The highest number of species observed at a single FAD was 18 (12 +/- 2, mean +/- SD) in equatorial and 13 (10 +/- 3) in tropical waters, not counting circumnatant species loosely associated with the FAD. Some species like Kyphosus vaigiensis, Canthidermis maculata, Elagatis bipinnulata, Acanthocybium solandri and Coryphaena hippurus were observed on all or most of the surveys. In this study, the contribution in biomass of the 18 common species associated with drifting FADs (but excluding circumnatant species), represents more than 98% of the biomass. The overall biomass values of closely associated species remains well below tuna biomass estimates for circumnatant tuna schools at FADs, estimated as high as 200 tons. The species that most significantly contribute to the by-catch in tuna purse-seines logically match those that showing the highest biomass values in our surveys (Carcharhinus spp., Elagatis bipinnulata, Coryphaena hippurus, Canthidermis maculata, and Acanthocybium solandri). One of the most abundant and ubiquitous species in our study was the spotted oceanic triggerfish Canthidermis maculata that sometimes formed massive schools of many thousands individuals around the drifting FADs.

Gray triggerfish (n = 1135) were collected predominantly from artificial habitat during 1999-2017. Specimens were sexed macroscopically and ages were assigned by counting translucent increments in sections of the first dorsal spine. Fish ranged in size from 22 to 617 mm fork length. The oldest female was assigned an age of 9 yrs; the oldest male, 10 yrs. A suite of growth models was tested to develop combined and sex-specific models.

Over the 74 day period of the spill, the oil remained offshore and did not result in shoreline incidents on the Australia mainland. At various times slicks were sighted over a 90,000 km(2) area, forming a layer of oil which was tracked by airplanes and satellites but the slicks typically remained within 35 km of the well head platform and were treated with 183,000 L of dispersants. The shelf area where the spill occurred is shallow (100-200 m) and includes off shore emergent reefs and cays and submerged banks and shoals. This study describes the increased inputs of oil to the system and assesses the environmental impact.

These studies were conducted to better understand the physical, chemical, and biological environments and how oil and gas activities may impact them. This paper focuses on monitoring sediment hydrocarbon chemistry. The projects included measuring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), n-alkanes and isoprenoids (SHCs), and sterane/triterpene (S/T) geochemical biomarkers and determining their distribution, possible sources, and environmental significance in the sediments of the Beaufort Sea and rivers emptying into it. Concentrations of hydrocarbons in sediments were variable on both spatial and temporal scales; surface sediment concentrations of total PAHs (TPAHs), the class of hydrocarbons of greatest environmental interest, averaged between 300 and 700 mu g/kg in different years of monitoring between 1985 and 2015. The concentrations were similar to those measured in other marine regions of Alaska where oil activities have not occurred. Sediment TPAH concentrations were below sediment quality guidelines values, indicating a low risk of harm to benthic marine communities. The hydrocarbons in the Beaufort Sea sediments are primarily from non-oil petrogenic and biogenic sources, with small amounts of pyrogenic hydrocarbons. Most of the hydrocarbons are carried to the Beaufort Sea in coastal erosion and river inputs of hydrocarbon-rich materials, such as peat and shale. The majority of the Beaufort Sea Development Area, including near production facilities, contains uncontaminated sediments with only a few small areas near (<100 m) some exploratory wells where petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations are above regional background.

Significant hydrocarbon discoveries and exploration licenses in the Labrador Sea underscore the need for quantitative information on seabird seasonal distribution and abundance, as this region is known to provide important habitat for seabirds year-round. We explore the utility of density surface modeling (DSM) to improve seabird information available for regional conservation and management decision making. We, (1) develop seasonal density surface models for seabirds in the Labrador Sea using data from vessel-based surveys (2006-2014: 13,783 linear km of surveys), (2) present measures of uncertainty in model predictions, (3) discuss how density surface models can inform conservation and management decision making, and 4) explore challenges and potential pitfalls associated with using these modeling procedures. Models predicted large areas of high seabird density in fall over continental shelf waters (max similar to 80 birds-km(-2)) driven largely by the southward migration of murres (Una app.) and dovekies (Alle alle) from Arctic breeding colonies. The continental shelf break was also highlighted as an important habitat feature, with predictions of high seabird densities particularly during summer (max similar to 70 birds-km(-2)). Notable concentrations of seabirds overlapped with several significant hydrocarbon discoveries on the continental shelf and large areas in the vicinity of the southern shelf break, which are in the early stages of exploration. Some, but not all, areas of high seabird density were within current Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area (EBSA) boundaries. Building predictive spatial models required knowledge of Distance Sampling and GAMs, and significant investments of time and computational power-resource needs that are becoming more common in ecological modeling. Visualization of predictions and their uncertainty needed to be considered for appropriate interpretation by end users. Model uncertainty tended to be greater where survey effort was limited or where predictor covariates exceeded the range of those observed. Predictive spatial models proved useful in generating defensible estimates of seabird densities in many areas of interest to the oil and gas industry in the Labrador Sea, and will have continued use in marine risk assessments and spatial planning activities in the region and beyond.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,11,0,14,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Environm & Climate Change Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Wildlife Res Div, Mt Pearl, NF, CanadaEnvironm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Dartmouth, NS, CanadaBird Studies Canada, Sackville, NB, Canada",Bird Studies Canada,,,2017-01-01,WOS:000457690600149,,

Total metal concentrations in water (dissolved + particulate) and sediments were in the range expected for coastal and oceanic areas. Abnormally high concentrations in waters were only found for Ba (80 mu g l(-1)) and Mn (12 mu g l(-1)) at the releasing point of one of the outfalls, and for the other metals, concentrations in water were found in stations closer to shore, suggesting continental inputs. In bottom sediments, only Fe and Mn showed abnormal concentrations closer to the effluent releasing point. Metal spatial distribution in shelf sediments showed the influence of the silt-clay fraction distribution, with deeper stations at the edge of the continental shelf, which are much richer in silt-clay fraction showing higher concentrations than shallower sediments typically dominated by carbonates. Metal concentrations in estuarine (mollusks and crustaceans) and marine (fish) organisms showed highest concentrations in oysters (Crassostrea rhizophorae). Fish tissues metal concentrations were similar between the continental shelf influenced by the oil exploration area and a control site. The results were within the range of concentrations reported for pristine environments without metals contamination.

Low structural differences occurred for successive immersion periods on both substrata because the most representative taxa did not suffer great changes until the eighth month (October 1997).

Data from inshore environments and the eastern English Channel extended the scope of the earlier survey. ii ) Much effort was committed to the harmonization of datasets on the macrobenthic infauna and associated environmental variables from different sources, which included desk-based evaluation of combined species lists and some laboratory work to resolve identification problems. iii ) A database dedicated to the outputs from the ICES North Sea Benthos Project (NSBP) 2000 was constructed at the Flanders Marine Institute, underpinned by a national resource commitment. This was indispensable in serving the needs of the present collaborative assessment and will continue to act as an internationalrepository for relevant biological and environmental data. Analyses of NSBP 2000 data i ) The structure and distribution of North Sea benthic communities can be explained largely by the measured (or modelled) natural environmental variables. These include temperature, salinity, tidal/ wave-induced bed stress, stratification, depth, and sediment type. Their relative importance varies spatially, and many are intercorrelated. ii ) Increased hydroclimatic variability, reduced salinity, and human-induced perturbations may account for the reduced diversity of the fauna of soft sediments in the shallowest parts of the southern North Sea. Distance from the richer Atlantic species pool may also contribute to a west-to-east decline in diversity in the southern North Sea. iii ) Coarser substrata especially in the southwestern North Sea and eastern English Channel generally supported species-rich communities, which contrasted with a latitudinal (south-to-north) trend towards higher diversity in finer sediments. iv ) Interface feeders were proportionately the dominant trophic group across most North Sea stations, while suspension-feeders predominated on the Oyster Ground.v ) North Sea-wide distributional patterns for the macro-infauna, epifauna, plankton, and fish indicated relative uniformity in the responses to environmental forcing at this level, though responses on smaller scales were more variable. vi ) For the southwestern North Sea, similar distributional patterns were observed for the meiofauna, macro-infauna, epifauna, and fish, again reflecting uniformity in the responses to environmental influences, especially habitat type and the hydrodynamic regime. vii ) The relationship between fishing activities and benthic communities was considered to be largely correlative rather than causative. For example, comparisons of heavily and lightly fished areas may be confounded by environmental distinctions, which themselves account for the absence of commercially exploitable stocks. viii ) NSBP 2000 data are unsuitable for evaluating the effects of fishing activities on larger (and rarer) infaunal species, which are not sampled adequately by conventional grabs or corers. ix ) Trace metal concentrations in sediments reflect the historical legacy of industrialization, but there was no evidence of any adverse consequences for the benthic macrofauna at the levels encountered in the southwestern North Sea in 2000. x ) There was no evidence of cumulative footprints associated with widely distributed industrial activities, especially oil and gas exploitation, in the southern North Sea. (Coverage was too sparse in the northern North Sea). xi ) Illustrations of the wider utility of NSBP 2000 data were provided by a case study of the ecological role of the sand mason worm, Lanice conchilega, and thedevelopment of habitat suitability models for predicting species occurrences. xii ) Analyses of the NSBP 2000 dataset are continuing, and additional insights will be reported in the peer-reviewed literature. Comparisons between the 1986 and 2000 ICES North Sea benthos surveys i ) Methodological differences between (and within) surveys were confounding variables in some assessments. ii ) North Sea-wide patterns in sediment type were similar, and there was no significant difference in median grain sizes between datasets for matched stations. iii ) Major distinctions between macrofaunal communities across the North Sea (especially along the 50 m contour line) were broadly similar. iv ) There were significant differences within or at the boundaries of communities, especially in areas of the northwestern and southeastern North Sea. In some areas, these may be accounted for by recent wind-induced changes in sediment stability, e.g. in the vicinity of the Dogger Bank. v ) Recent increases in sea surface temperature (SST) and associated food availability may account for species compositional changes, for example, in the German Bight and the southwestern North Sea approaching the English Channel. vi ) Trends in univariate measures of the benthos at matching stations were very similar. For example, biomass and mean individual weights decreased with increasing latitude, and there was close concordance in the data from the 1986 and 2000 surveys.vii ) Changes in the distributions or densities of selected species across the North Sea appeared in combination to reflect a dynamic equilibrium, with no evidence of a consistent directional trend. viii ) Some species may be responding to increased SST, e.g. the brittlestar Acrocnida (Amphiura) brachiata, which, in 2000, occurred more frequently in the eastern North Sea, especially the German Bight, and on the Dogger Bank. ix ) Using North Sea-wide averages, there was a marginal increase in densities and a marginal decrease in diversity. For individual communities, most univariate measures were lower in 2000, although in many cases the differences were not statistically significant. Using multimetric indices, the quality status of all communities could be described as good to high, according to recently evolved classification schemes. x ) North Sea-wide patterns in the distribution of the dominant (interface and suspension) feeding types were similar. There were significant differences in the proportional numerical contribution of feeding types within communities. However, the direction of change was inconsistent, and the causes remain speculative. xi ) There was no evidence that changes in the benthos between the two sampling occasions were attributable to changes in fishing effort. xii ) Comparisons of the 1986 and 2000 datasets are continuing, and additional insights will be reported in the peer-reviewed literature. Review of other relevant information (1986-2000)i ) There was no evidence from the available literature of a consistent directional trend over time in the densities or diversity of the benthic macrofauna at various North Sea locations. However, a number of studies identified responses to climatic changes (exemplified by correlations with the NAO Index), the nature and timing of which varied with locality. ii ) Although the effects of commercial fishing may (through gear impact or predator removal) induce structural changes in benthic communities, there was as yet no evidence from the available literature of adverse consequences for the overall process of energy transfer through the benthic ecosystem. Conclusions i ) North Sea benthic communities remain in equilibrium with naturalenvironmental forces, which account for most of the observed variability in space and time. Traits of resilience and adaptability help to explain patterns and changes in the benthic communities at the level of the entire North Sea and more locally, respectively. This conclusion can be applied to the responses both to natural and human influences. ii ) Periodic sea-wide synoptic surveys are important to underpin the interpretation of local environmental assessments, e.g. to evaluate the significance of species distributional changes, which may not be readily identifiable over smaller scales.Future observations in a North Sea-wide setting will also be important to identify the range of ecological consequences of any directional climatic changes. iii ) The NSBP 2000 initiative provided an excellent example of the willingness of many data providers to cooperate under ICES auspices. Practical lessons for the conduct of future collaborative survey and data compilation exercises included the importance of harmonized survey and sampling methodologies, the wider conduct of ring-testing and certification of taxonomic identification skills, the better documentation of individual datasets, and improved incentives for the submission of data to repositories to avoid data loss. iv ) Although opportunistic exploitation of existing data is not a substitute for new survey work, it has the potential to increase the frequency of periodic assessments on large scales that are increasingly required to address issues such as the consequences of global warming or ocean acidification. v ) The NSBP 2000 initiative demonstrates the capability of ICES to facilitate assessments of the marine environment across larger spatial scales and over longer periods than are feasible by most other organizations. Recommendations i ) Recommendations are made for the conduct of a coordinated interdisciplinary synoptic survey of the North Sea in 2010 under ICES auspices. ii ) Other recommendations relate to the extension of synoptic surveys into other sea areas, the integration of outcomes with parallel information from other contemporary studies, the provision of long-term support for the North Sea Benthos database, and the establishment of links with other (European and global) databases to promote wider access.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1017-6195,,,,,,,,,,,"Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, Remembrance Avenue, Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, CM0 8HA, United Kingdom",,,,2007-09-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14312076293,,

This rich history has left its mark on the seabed but accurate maps showing the location and character of surviving seabed archaeology do not exist to the same extent as for archaeology on land. ORCA Marine was commissioned by Historic Scotland to work with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in interrogating marine data sets to enhance historic environment records of Orkney Waters and the Pentland Firth. These waters were prioritised for their history of maritime activity and to help guide planning and developments in an area highlighted by the Scottish Government for marine renewable energy.A variety of recent and legacy datasets, including wreck databases; sonar data gathered by public sector bodies; aerial photography; seabed cores; Admiralty charts; and local knowledge, were examined for their effectiveness in discovering and interpreting marine cultural heritage cost-effectively. A methodology was developed that enabled marine cultural heritage information to be quickly assimilated within the national and regional inventories for dissemination online. Polygonisation of records resulted in GIS-based shapefiles identifying site extents, and areas of archaeological potential in relation to wrecks, submerged prehistoric landscapes, anchorages and fishing areas.Substantial gaps in data coverage were identified and areas of the seabed have been surveyed at resolutions that are sufficient to detect large upstanding remains such as iron shipwrecks but insufficient to identify smaller archaeological features. Other geophysical datasets have been created at a resolution detailed enough to allow the recognition of smaller anomalies but in some cases processing of the data has removed small anomalies of interest to archaeologists. Intensively used marine areas often contain the most artefactual remains such as historic ports being developed to service the marine renewable industry. Zones of high wave and tidal energy favoured for renewable energy devices include navigation channels and hazards where a large number of wrecks are documented. Transmission cable routes cross deep water where 20th-century wartime losses occurred. Planning and development of infrastructure relating to renewables may also interact with significant built heritage and archaeology on the foreshore and coast edge. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

They generate critical services for humans including shoreline protection, carbon storage, pollution mitigation, and fisheries production. Restoration of coastal wetlands has historically been viewed as a secondary conservation strategy, but recently-given the continued loss of wetlands worldwide-many non-governmental and governmental organizations have elevated habitat restoration to be a primary method for wetland conservation. The long-held paradigm in coastal wetland restoration has been to restore target habitats by reducing physical stressors and avoiding competition among outplants, such as mangrove saplings or Spartina plugs. Recent ecological research, however, reveals that positive species interactions, such as facilitation, are critical to wetland recovery after disturbance. Here, we review the scientific evidence for the importance of positive species interactions in the recovery of salt-marsh and mangrove ecosystems and assess the extent to which they have been integrated into restoration studies. We found that only a small proportion of studies of marsh and mangrove restoration examined the effects of positive species interactions, despite the important role they play in the regrowth of coastal wetlands. We outline how positive species interactions can be systematically incorporated into future restoration work and discuss how this incorporation can help the reestablishment of coastal wetland biota through: (1) trophic facilitation, (2) stress reduction, and (3) associational defenses. The absence of positive interactions in restoration designs may partially explain the significant disparities between the functioning of natural and restored coastal plant ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,74,2,0,0,60,1,80,,,2296-701X,,,,,,,,,,,"Duke Univ, Div Marine Sci & Conservat, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA",,,,2019-04-01,WOS:000467437700002,,

If carbon dioxide leakage occurs carbonate chemistry in the bottom zone and sessile benthic fauna are expected to be the most likely affected by elevated levels of CO2. Though generic mechanisms and advisory conclusions on the presumable impact of increased acidity on the marine benthic biota were formulated they cannot be applied uniformly across different environmental variables as specific local conditions may alter biological response to hypercapnia. A laboratory experiment was conducted to quantify the effects of mediumterm (8 wk) exposure to seawater acidification (pH 7.7-6.5) on the infaunal polychaete Hediste diversicolor from the southern Baltic Sea using multimarker approach. Under moderate acidity (pH 7.5 and 7.1) the polychaetes were found to increase metabolic rate (by 13.4% and 19.6%, respectively) and reduce their body mass (by 8.1% and 5.5% wet weight, respectively and by 6.1% and 3.0% dry weight, respectively) whilst enhancing synthesis of antioxidant malondialdehyde (by 22.8% and 65.3%, respectively). In the most acidic environment (pH 6.5) the ragworms showed overall metabolic slow down (by 34.8%) and impaired growth (e.g. by 10.2% for length of the first three segments) indicative of low vulnerability to hypercapnia. High implicit tolerance of the polychaetes to increased acidity in the environment stems inevitably from a certain level of pre-adaptation to pH reduction events which occur in organic-rich stratified sediments due to intense aerobic biomineralization leading often to oxygen depletion and formation of toxic hydrogen sulphide. Acidification did not affect energetic reserves suggesting that costs of acid-base maintenance were covered mainly from assimilated food and that proteins were not used as metabolic substrates.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,0,6,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Gdansk, Inst Oceanog, Al Pilsudskiego 46, PL-81378 Gdynia, PolandPolish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Dept Genet & Marine Biotechnol, Ul Powstancow Warszawy 55, PL-81712 Sopot, Poland",,,,2020-09-08,WOS:000562582100005,,

The review also summarized the degree of contamination of heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons that accumulated in marine water, sediments and living organisms. In addition, the review critically suggested several mitigation strategies to alleviate the impacts of such pollutions. The key findings indicated that the oil and gas production and processing industries, desalination industries, sea traffic, urban development, and discharge of treated wastewater and ballast water along with seasonal upwelling, and climate change were the main contributors of marine pollution in these regions including the Sea of Oman. The major identified pollutants were heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, organochlorine, tar, harmful algal blooms, marine debris, non-native species, and sediment that are posing severe threats to marine biodiversity and ecosystems. The occurrence of radionuclides in these regions seems to be smaller compared to the World Ocean because of the insignificant disposal of nuclear waste due to strict law enforcement and monitoring. However, marine litter, micro-plastic, radionuclides, greenhouse gases, and non-point pollutant sources have not been investigated properly. Therefore, efforts to identify the possible sources of pollution, estimate their impacts based on field data and numerical modeling, and understand ocean dynamics with regard to the transportation and deposition of sediments and pollutants need to be undertaken in order to protect the coastal and marine environment and ecosystems. Furthermore, integration of robotic aircraft along with satellite surveillance can be an additional measure deployed for the purposes of monitoring oil spillage, illegal ballast water discharge, harmful algal blooms, and beach utilization.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,9,0,16,,,1738-5261,2005-7172,,,,,,,,,,"Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, Muscat 123, Oman",,,,2020-03-03,WOS:000514850100001,,

In this study, we used, for the first time, a coastal cabled observatory (OBSEA) to video monitor activity rhythms of different fish species within an artificial reef area at a high frequency. During 1 mo, 30 min daily count patterns were continuously measured and compared with the corresponding solar irradiance. A significant (p < 0.05) day-night patterning was observed in the majority of recognized taxa by Chi-Square periodogram analysis.

The two sites encompassed a wide range of complex seabed geologies, from high strength limestones to uncemented silts, where conventional drag anchors or driven anchor piles would not prove entirely suitable. Installation was carried out using a dynamically-positioned vessel, operated by Fugro, on which an inventive purpose-built drilling tower had been erected specifically for the project. The installation also included development and deployment of an ingenious seabed frame that could grip and release the piles progressively, plus casings to temporarily stabilise the drilled holes from collapsing sands.

In Lee County, Florida, this problem reached a critical stage in 2003/2004 when massive rhodophyte blooms washed ashore, making beaches unsuitable for recreation and requiring an expensive removal program. To better understand the ecology of these blooms, water quality and macroalgae sampling was conducted in August 2004, prior to hurricane Charley, and again in late October following several months of large freshwater discharges from the Caloosahatchee River. During both samplings, water and macroalgae were collected along a gradient extending from the Caloosahatchee River to natural and artificial reefs up to 26 km from shore.Dissolved nutrient concentrations were generally high throughout the study area, with significantly higher concentrations in the Caloosahatchee River. Mean dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the Caloosahatchee River increased from Ortona Lock (< 18 mu M) to Franklin Lock (23-28 mu M) downstream during both samplings, indicating significant enrichment within the basin. On coastal reefs, mean ammonium concentrations increased six-fold (<= 0.20-1.31 mu M) and soluble reactive phosphorus increased three-fold (0.30-0.92 mu M) from August to October, respectively. Mean reef macroalgae C:N ratios were low and similar in August (13.9) and October (13.5), and C:P and N:P ratios were also low but decreased significantly from August to October (386-242 and 27.4-17.5, respectively). Macroalgal delta N-15 values increased from Ortona Lock (+8 to 9 parts per thousand) to Franklin Lock (+12 to 15 parts per thousand) during both samplings, were within the sewage nitrogen range, and decreased with increasing distance from shore to similar to+3.0 parts per thousand. at the most offshore reef. Macroalgae (Gracilaria, Hypnea, Botryocladia, Eucheuma, Sargassum) collected in July 2004 from Lee County beaches had mean delta N-15 values >+6.0 parts per thousand, similar to values for macroalgae on inshore reefs and within the sewage nitrogen range. However, mean delta N-15 values of reef macroalgae decreased from August (+5.84 parts per thousand) to October (+3.89 parts per thousand) as Caloosahatchee River discharges increased, suggesting relatively larger contributions from nitrogen sources with low delta N-15 values (<+3 parts per thousand), such as rainfall and agricultural fertilizers, in the wet season. Improved management of freshwater releases from Lake Okeechobee, combined with nutrient removal from sewage effluent within the Caloosahatchee River drainage basin, could help mitigate future macroalgal blooms in Lee County's coastal waters.(c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on freshwater wetlands because these ecosystems are often characterized by foundation species; eutrophication and other environmental changes may cause the loss of some of these species, thus severely damaging wetland ecosystems. To better understand how wetland primary producer foundation species support other species and ecosystem functions across environmental gradients, we reviewed similar to 150 studies in subtropical, boreal, and temperate freshwater wetlands. We look at how the relative dominance of conspicuous and well-documented species (i.e., sawgrass, benthic diatoms and cyanobacteria, Sphagnum mosses, and bald cypress) and the foundational roles they play interact with hydrology, nutrient availability, and exposure to fire and salinity in representative wetlands. Based on the evidence analyzed, we argue that the foundation species concept should be more broadly applied to include organisms that regulate ecosystems at different spatial scales, notably the microscopic benthic algae that critically support associated communities and mediate freshwater wetlands' ecosystem functioning.

Their ingestion has been documented in several species worldwide, but the impact of specific anthropogenic activities remains largely unexplored. In this study, MPs were characterized in different benthic fish sampled after 2.5 years of huge engineering operations for the parbuckling project on the Costa Concordia wreck at Giglio Island. Fish collected in proximity of the wreck showed a high ingestion of microplastics compared to both fish from a control area and values reported worldwide. Also the elevated percentage of nylon, polypropylene lines and the presence of polystyrene are quite unusual for marine organisms sampled in natural field conditions, thus supporting the possible relationship of ingested microplastics with maritime operations during wreck removal. On the other hand, the use of transplanted mussels revealed a lower frequency of ingested MPs, and did not discriminate differences between the wreck and the control area. Some variations were observed in terms of typology and size of particles between surface and bottom-caged mussels highlighting the influence of a different distribution of MPs along the water column. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that MPs pollution in the area of Costa Concordia was more evident on benthonic environment than on seawater column, providing novel insights on the possibility of using appropriate sentinel organisms for monitoring specific anthropogenic sources of MPs pollution in the marine environment.

There are extensive resources of renewable energy within the marine environment and increasing interest in extracting energy from locations with either large tidal range, rapid flow with and without wave interaction, or large wave resources. However, the ecological implications of altering the hydrodynamics of the marine environment are poorly understood. Ecological data for areas targeted for marine renewable developments are often limited, not least because of the considerable challenges to sampling in high energy environments. In order to predict the scale and nature of ecological implications there is a need for greater understanding of the distribution and extent of the renewable energy resource and in turn, of how marine renewable energy installations (MREIs) may alter energy in the environment. Regional ecological implications of a MREI need to be considered against the greater and global ecological threat of climate change. Finally, it is recommended that the identification of species and biotopes susceptible to the removal of hydrokinetic energy could be a suitable strategy for understanding how a MREI may alter flow conditions.

However, it has not yet fully developed its renewable energy production capacity, with no commercial offshore wind production to date, and remains highly dependent on fossil fuel imports. The country is also one of Europe's most biodiverse, on land and at sea. This study spatially assesses the country's offshore wind energy potential by incorporating the newly designated marine protected areas (MPAs) to the official Spanish strategic environmental assessment for the installation of offshore windfarms (SEA). It also identifies optimal areas for offshore windfarm development according to key physical variables such as wind speed, depth and substrate type. It finally assesses real commercial windfarm projects against current environmental constraints. The results show that nearly 50% of the whole area within 24 nm from the Spanish coast could be suitable for offshore windfarm development at the planning phase. However, only 0.7% of that area is optimal for wind energy production with current fixed turbine technology. Nevertheless, either area would allow Spain to meet its national targets of 750 MW of ocean power capacity installed by 2020 under adequate local wind conditions. Over 88% of all commercial windfarm project area is within the SEA's Exclusion zone, thus unfeasible under current circumstances. Technological breakthroughs like floating turbines may soon make the optimal windfarm area (OWA) less restrictive and reduce current environmental impacts of marine windfarms within a truly sustainable Blue Growth.

After the 2008 general election the new government commenced review of this legislation while consideration was given to 'unlocking New Zealand's energy potential' as a key component to an export-led economic recovery. The government is promoting oil, gas and mineral exploration on land and at sea. The government is also enacting boundaries that extend continental shelf jurisdiction. These developments may lead to further progress on an integrated system that covers all aspects of marine management that began in 2000.

Reef flat sediments are mainly very poorly to moderately sorted carbonate gravels and sands with occasional boulders and very little silt, with terrigenous sediments limited to a narrow, nearshore strip. Bulk sediment geochemical analyses show that trace metal concentrations are generally very low across the reef flat and closely similar to pristine reef areas offshore rather than to the nearby contaminated areas within Suva Lagoon. Exceptions occur close to villages, however, where sediments are enriched in Pb, As, and other trace metals, and possibly near wreck sites on the reef where Fe increases locally. These data together with those for major and minor oxides show that there is little or no movement of sediments from the rivers and deeper lagoon onto the carbonate reef flat even though extreme events such as tsunamis or cyclones affect the area.

In this experiment, CO2 was injected beneath the seafloor, and closely monitored as the CO2 was allowed to leak into the overlying water column. We performed mapping observations using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with sensors to monitor physical and chemical conditions in the vicinity of the CO2 leakage. We also numerically simulated the behavior of the low-pH plume caused by the CO2 leakage, within the calculated tidal current in the bay.The results of AUV mapping observations showed that physical and chemical characteristics of the water mass in Ardmucknish bay are sensitive to tidal variations (low or high tide), and the ascent speed of the leaked CO2 bubble and the pH decrease in the vicinity of the CO2 leakage area are predominantly controlled by the tidal phase in the bay. The observations using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) installed in the AUV indicated that the current in the bay flows westwards at high tide and eastwards at low tide. The simulated tidal current agreed well with the tidal current observed by ADCP. Numerical simulation suggested that the pH decrease due to the leaked CO2 is restricted to the vicinity of the CO2 leakage area, and fluctuates greatly with tidal variations. In flood tide periods, diffusion of the low-pH plume caused by the leaked CO2 is barely detectable because low-pH seawater intrudes into the bay from the bay mouth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

What causes this variation is not fully known and could have important implications for management and protection of the seagrass habitat to continue to act as a natural carbon sink. Here, we assessed sedimentary organic carbon in Zostera marina meadows (and adjacent unvegetated sediment) in four distinct areas of Europe (Gullmar Fjord on the Swedish Skagerrak coast, Asko in the Baltic Sea, Sozopol in the Black Sea and Ria Formosa in southern Portugal) down to ~35 cm depth. We also tested how sedimentary organic carbon in Z. marina meadows relates to different sediment characteristics, a range of seagrass-associated variables and water depth. The seagrass carbon storage varied greatly among areas, with an average organic carbon content ranging from 2.79 0.50% in the Gullmar Fjord to 0.17 0.02% in the area of Sozopol. We found that a high proportion of fine grain size, high porosity and low density of the sediment is strongly related to high carbon content in Z. marina sediment. We suggest that sediment properties should be included as an important factor when evaluating high priority areas in management of Z. marina generated carbon sinks.

The uncertainty is made greater by the timescale required for scouring and effects, such as sediment abrasion, pile installation impacts, and operationally and environmentally induced dynamic motions. The rapid growth in offshore wind, particularly in European waters, has led to a requirement for estimates for scour development in such soils. This becomes very pertinent for large-volume serial installation of foundations, such as those required for offshore wind farm developments, given that there is a limit to the amount of detailed geotechnical information that can be collected as part of a project, and soil erosion testing is not standard. There is a reliance in geotechnical data, such as undrained shear strength, derived from cone penetration tests, supplemented with borehole data collected at a limited number of locations across the wind farm site combined with laboratory analysis of soil samples. This paper reviews the present evidence from both field and laboratory measurements of scour potential and looks at possible approaches for determining scour magnitude in cohesive soils including hydraulic and mechanical effects.

Paleorecords reveal stepwise rapid cooling and ice growth across the EOT tightly coupled to a transient benthic C-13 excursion and a major and permanent deepening of the carbonate compensation depth (CCD). Based on biogeochemical box modeling, Merico et al. (2008) suggested that a combination of (1) glacioeustatic sea level fall-induced shelf-basin carbonate burial fractionation and (2) shelf carbonate weathering can account for the carbon cycle perturbation, but this finding has been questioned. Alternative proposed mechanisms include increased ocean ventilation, decreased carbonate burial, increased organic carbon burial, increased silicate weathering, and increased ocean calcium concentration. Here we use an improved version of the biogeochemical box model of Merico et al. (2008) to reevaluate these competing hypotheses and an additional mechanism, the expansion of carbon capacitors such as permafrost and peatlands. We find that changes in calcium concentration, silicate weathering, and carbonate or organic carbon burial each yield a response that is fundamentally at odds with the form and/or sign of the paleorecords. Shelf-basin carbonate burial fractionation (CCD change), plus shelf carbonate weathering, sequestration of C-12-enriched carbon into carbon capacitors, and possibly increased ocean ventilation (C-13 excursion), offers the best fit to the paleorecords.

Colonization of the experimental artificial reef was by apprx27 taxa of algae and sessile invertebrates (Lam 2000). The major taxonomic groups collected were: algae (6 species), bryozoans (3 species), polychaetes (5 species), bivalves (3 species), barnacles (3 species), tunicates (2 species), sponges (3 species) and corals (2 species). These were monitored in terms of their competitive interactions to identify the patterns of competition hierarchy and network over time and to examine the effect of intraspecific competition on community development. A total of 1419 interspecific competitive interactions were observed. Of these, 1380 were overgrowths and 39 were standoffs. A significant correlation between number of interspecific interactions and percentage cover was obtained only for Balanus trigonus and Pachychalina variabilis (Kendall's test, both p-values<0.05). Competition hierarchy networks kept changing during the trimonthly monitoring period between 1994 and 1995. In general, the barnacles and the encrusting bryozoans constituted the lowest level of the hierarchy charts whereas the bryozoan, bivalves, the ascidian Styela plicata, sponges and the coral Culicia japonica were always at the top. All the hierarchy charts were one way, with no backloops. The lack of complexity in the hierarchical charts may be attributed to the non-active interspecific competition caused by low percentage cover. Thus, within the first two years of its deployment, the initial community that developed on the artificial reef test blocks could be described as highly disturbed (by hypoxia and predation), with the co-existence of species with different competencies to form simple but seasonally-varying hierarchy networks.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1011-4041,,,,,,,,,,,"Department of Ecology and Biodiversity, Swire Institute of Marine Science, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China",,,,2001-01-01,BCI:BCI200300527162,,

The results showed that: before-casting reef: phyla 4, genera 21, species 33, dominant species 7, the average cell abundance was 56. 50 x 103 cells . m-3, H' = 2. 85, dMa = 1. 02, J' = 0. 70 in the control area; phyla 4, genera 19, species 30, dominant species 7, cell abundance 40. 57 x 103 cells . m-3, H' = 2. 67, dMa = 0. 76, J' = 0. 74 in reef area.

Through GRA, the outcomes showed differences of relationship on cell abundance and ecological factors in reef area. It was found that total inorganic nitrogen ( TIN) and COD had a big influence acting on the abundance of phytoplankton from before casting reef period, and after casting reef the decline of transmittance could hinder algae to absorb nitrogen, promoting them to absorb silicate. It would be a reason to explain the mass propagation of C. jonesianus.

Development in the marine environment may affect marine bird populations. Red-throated divers are known to be displaced, causing effective habitat loss, by construction and operation of offshore wind farms, with this effect primarily seen during the non-breeding season when divers use areas of offshore wind development. However, the energetic, physiological and demographic consequences of displacement are currently unknown. If divers are already energetically constrained in the non-breeding season, they may struggle to meet the additional energetic demands following displacement. The aim of the Red- throated Diver Energetics Project (https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/rtde-project/) is to collect and compare novel data on foraging and movement behaviour of red-throated divers in the breeding and non-breeding season. In 2018, the Red-throated Diver Energetics Project tagged 74 divers breeding in Iceland, Orkney, Shetland and Finland with archival time depth recorder (TDR) and geolocator (GLS) tags. In 2019, tagged divers were found, caught and tags removed to obtain data on their approximate location and their dive behaviour in the 2018/19 non-breeding season. Analyses of these data are presented in a separate report (JNCC Report No. 638). The present report describes the 2019 breeding season, tag retrieval/redeployment and tag/trapping effects on red-throated divers. Recapturing tagged divers was challenging. Locating tagged birds was difficult and catching them took much longer than during tag deployment in 2018. A total of 27 tagged divers were caught and tags removed. Of these, 18 were fitted with new TDR and GLS tags to obtain information on inter-annual variation in foraging behaviour for the same individuals. A further 15 sets of tags were deployed on divers that had not been tagged previously. In 2020, attempts will be made to recapture divers carrying these newly deployed tags plus divers carrying the 2018 deployment that were missed in 2019. Three methods were used to look for any tag and trapping effects: resighting rates of tagged divers, changes in body mass of tagged divers between 2018 and 2019 and breeding success at nest sites where trapping was attempted compared with control sites. Additionally, mortality of three tagged divers was considered in the context of bycatch rates of ringed divers. Across all sites (countries) combined, the resighting rate of tagged divers was reported to be 69% (n=50 tagged divers seen) although this varied from 53% to 92% depending on site. For a long-lived species, a resighting rate of 80-90% would be expected. However, finding tagged divers was challenging and it is possible that tagged birds did return but were not seen. Alternatively, divers may not breed every year, irrespective of whether they are tagged. Without a marked control group of untagged divers, e.g. by using colour rings on untagged divers, it is not possible to make a quantitative evaluation of this resighting rate. Body mass of tagged divers retrapped in 2019 was not significantly different to their body mass in 2018. This suggests that carrying tags does not reduce body condition in individuals that returned to breed. However, it was not possible to look at body mass of tagged birds that were not recaptured so our sample could have been biased. Breeding success was found to be significantly lower at nest sites where trapping was attempted, compared with control nest sites (breeding success = 38% at trapped nests, 58% at control nests for Scotland and Finland, combined), although evidence for this effect in Finland was weak. This suggests that disturbance from attempting to catch divers to deploy or retrieve tags can increase the likelihood of a breeding attempt failing, but that this effect was seen more strongly in some trapping locations than others. Mortality of three Finnish tagged divers was reported during August 2018-June 2019, with two due to drowning in freshwater nets and a third of unknown causes. Bycatch is known to be a problem for adult red-throated divers, e.g. 75% and 60% of ring recoveries of Finnish-and British-ringed divers, respectively, were due to being caught in a net, where cause of death was known. However, drowning in a net set in freshwater is much more common in Finland compared with Britain (60% and 8%, respectively, of mortalities of known cause for ringed divers). Therefore, these mortalities of tagged divers could have happened irrespective of them carrying tags. Despite breeding success potentially being decreased by attempts to trap divers, and no discernible tag effects (i.e. no decrease in body mass of tagged divers detected) we still recommend trying to recapture and remove as many tags as possible from red-throated divers. It is still possible that ongoing undetected tag effects exist and, given the red-throated diver life history strategy of high adult survival and low productivity, the population will better withstand short-term reductions in productivity from trapping over any small decrease in adult survival due to carrying tags for many years.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-08-28,ZOOREC:ZOOR15709060085,,

This complex mixture of man-made and natural substances contains higher concentrations of certain metals (Ba, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and hydrocarbons than are observed in background sediments. With decommissioning of older platforms underway, an evaluation of the environmental interactions and chemical fate of the drill cuttings accumulations is required.This review concentrates on contaminants within drill cutting accumulations in the Northern and Central North Sea (56 degreesN-62 degreesN). Present literature reviewed reveals that hydrocarbons within the cuttings piles remain relatively unchanged with time. A considerable proportion of the associated contaminants are likely to remain within the cuttings pile unless they are disturbed which will then increase exchanges of porewater and solids back to the seabed surface resulting in pathways of exposure for organisms.

Mangrove forests, with the other two 'blue carbon' habitats, are exceptionally powerful carbon sinks. Maintaining and enhancing these sinks is an emerging priority in climate change mitigation. However, managing any one ecosystem on its own risks is ignoring important contextual drivers of carbon storage emerging from its place in the seascape. We consider how interactions between these coastal habitats directly or indirectly affect the amounts of carbon they can store.Recent Findings The export of carbon from seagrasses may occur over hundreds or thousands of kilometres, much further than reported for mangroves or tidal marshes. Seagrasses may buffer mangroves from wave impacts, assisting forest regeneration. Trophic cascades supported by contiguous blue carbon habitat may limit excessive herbivory and bioturbation in them but evidence is limited.Summary Direct transfers of carbon between blue carbon habitats are common and are likely to enhance total carbon storage, but our understanding of their contribution to carbon stocks at the seascape level is elementary. There is evidence for indirect enhancement of carbon storage at the seascape by close association of habitats, mostly through the creation and maintenance of propitious conditions by one ecosystem for another. Protection from waves of mangroves by seagrass and protection from excess nutrients and sediment of seagrass by mangroves and tidal marsh are key mechanisms. There is little evidence or theory suggesting negative effects on carbon storage of one blue carbon habitat on another.",,,,,,,,,46,1,0,0,34,1,50,,,2198-6436,,,,,,,,,,,"Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Sighthill Campus, Edinburgh EH11 4BN, Midlothian, ScotlandEdinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Life Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Embu, Dept Biol Sci, Embu, KenyaAuckland Univ Technol, Inst Appl Ecol, Auckland, New Zealand",Univ Embu,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000432549800005,,

Spatial management of these vulnerable marine ecosystems requires accurate knowledge of their distribution. Predictive habitat suitability modelling, using species presence data and a suite of environmental predictor variables, has emerged as a useful tool for inferring distributions outside of known areas. However, validation of model predictions is typically performed with non-independent data. In this study, we describe the results of habitat suitability models constructed for four deep-sea reef-forming coral species across a large region of the South Pacific Ocean using MaxEnt and Boosted Regression Tree modelling approaches. In order to validate model predictions we conducted a photographic survey on a set of seamounts in an un-sampled area east of New Zealand. The likelihood of habitat suitable for reef-forming corals on these seamounts was predicted to be variable, but very high in some regions, particularly where levels of aragonite saturation, dissolved oxygen, and particulate organic carbon were optimal. However, the observed frequency of coral occurrence in analyses of survey photographic data was much lower than expected, and patterns of observed versus predicted coral distribution were not highly correlated. The poor performance of these broad-scale models is attributed to lack of recorded species absences to inform the models, low precision of global bathymetry models, and lack of data on the geomorphology and substrate of the seamounts at scales appropriate to the modelled taxa. This demonstrates the need to use caution when interpreting and applying broad-scale, presence-only model results for fisheries management and conservation planning in data poor areas of the deep sea. Future improvements in the predictive performance of broad-scale models will rely on the continued advancement in modelling of environmental predictor variables, refinements in modelling approaches to deal with missing or biased inputs, and incorporation of true absence data.

Here, we emphasize their major role in the co-design of tailored coastal climate services (CCS) based on a case study of French Polynesia. In this perspective, we assessed climate change perceptions by public authorities and identified their needs with regard to climate-related science. This assessment included an analysis of the decision-making context, semi-structured interviews with practitioners representing 23 administrative divisions directly or indirectly involved in climate change issues, and a workshop dedicated to discussing needs in terms of CCS. Generally, respondents did not identify climate change as a major current issue in French Polynesia; they showed more concern for economic growth, pollution, land tenure, and land use planning. However, interviewees were concerned about future impacts of sea-level rise (SLR) and ocean warming and acidification, mentioning in particular their detrimental impacts on marine ecosystems, shoreline position, economy (especially agriculture and the blue economy), and freshwater resources. The interviewed practitioners showed particular interest in SLR projections for future decades up to a century, and for knowledge on expected impacts to critical infrastructure, coastal systems, and natural resources. Practitioners' needs made it possible to co-define four CCS to be developed: (1) the design of sea-levelrise-compatible critical infrastructures (airports and ports); (2) adapting to the risk of destabilization of beaches and reef islands; (3) professional training on climate change impacts and adaptation, including an analysis of potentially emerging new jobs in the SLR context; and (4) the development of participatory approaches for observing climate change impacts. While the co-development of these CCS will require a multiyear engagement of stakeholders concerned with climate change adaptation, our results already shed light on specific needs for salient CCS in highly vulnerable tropical island territories.",,,,,,,,,11,1,0,0,2,0,11,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Creocean, La Rochelle, FranceLa Rochelle Univ, CNRS, UMR LIENSs 7266, La Rochelle, FranceFrench Geol Survey, BRGM, Coastal Risks & Climate Change Unit, Orleans, France",Creocean,,,2020-04-06,WOS:000521221300001,,

The Gulf is a natural hydrocarbon basin, rich with stores of oil and gas that lie in reservoirs deep beneath the seafloor. The natural seepage of hydrocarbons across the Gulf system is extensive and, thus, the system's biological components experience ephemeral, if not, frequent, hydrocarbon exposure. In contrast to natural seepage, which is diffuse and variable over space and time, the 2010 Macondo oil well blowout, represented an intense, focused hydrocarbon infusion to the Gulf's deepwaters. The Macondo blowout drove rapid shifts in microbial populations and activity, revealed unexpected phenomena, such as deepwater hydrocarbon plumes and marine oil snow sedimentation, and impacted the Gulf's pelagic and benthic ecosystems. Understanding the distribution and fate of Macondo oil was limited to some degree by an insufficient ability to predict the physical movement of water in the Gulf. In other words, the available physical oceanographic models lacked critical components. In the past six years, much has been learned about the physical oceanography of the Gulf, providing transformative knowledge that will improve the ability to predict the movement of water and the hydrocarbons they carry in future blowout scenarios. Similarly, much has been learned about the processing and fate of Macondo hydrocarbons. Here, we provide an overview of the distribution, fate and impacts of Macondo hydrocarbons and offer suggestions for future research to push the field of oil spill response research forward.

Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage (QICS). Climate change caused by increasing emissions of CO2, principally the burning of fossil fuels for power generation, is one of the most pressing concerns for society. Currently around 90% of the UK's energy needs are met by fossil fuels which will probably continue to be the predominant source of energy for decades to come. Developing our understanding of the pros and cons of a range of strategies designed to reduce CO2 emissions is vital. Of the available strategies such as wind, wave and solar renewables and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) none are without potential problems or limitations. The concept of CCS simply put is to capture CO2 during the process of power generation and to store it permanently in deep geological structures beneath the land or sea surface. If CCS is successful existing fossil fuel reserves could be used whilst new forms of power generation with low CO2 emissions are developed. A few projects have been successfully demonstrating either capture or storage on limited scales, so it is established that the technical challenges are surmountable. Research is also demonstrating that the geological structures are in general robust for long term storage (for example oil deposits remain in place within geological strata).

Electromagnetic telemetry has been used to measure seasonal changes in locomotor activity and body movements of lobsters on an artificial reef in Poole Bay, southern England. Both measures of activity showed marked seasonal variation, related primarily to water temperature, with greatest activity in late summer and minimum values in winter. Subsidiary effects of water movement and seabed illumination were also indicated. Throughout the spring and summer, excursions outside shelter were almost exclusively nocturnal, with movement peaking in the early part of the night. Body movements followed a similar pattern, but with less abrupt changes, suggesting a degree of activity within shelters during the day. Diel timing of lobster activity appeared to be mainly governed exogenously by light level, since the length of the nocturnal active period and the timing of the activity peak varied seasonally with the times of sunset and sunrise, and there was a relative increase in diurnal activity during periods of low seabed light levels caused by increased turbidity. During low temperatures in mid to late winter, activity was low throughout the 24 h cycle. These findings suggest that there are Likely to be significant seasonal changes in the relationship between fishing effort and fishing mortality that need to be taken into account in lobster stock assessment.",,,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,36,0,50,,,0171-8630,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Southampton, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England",,,,1999-01-01,WOS:000083230100024,,

Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage (QICS). Climate change caused by increasing emissions of CO2, principally the burning of fossil fuels for power generation, is one of the most pressing concerns for society. Currently around 90% of the UK's energy needs are met by fossil fuels which will probably continue to be the predominant source of energy for decades to come. Developing our understanding of the pros and cons of a range of strategies designed to reduce CO2 emissions is vital. Of the available strategies such as wind, wave and solar renewables and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) none are without potential problems or limitations. The concept of CCS simply put is to capture CO2 during the process of power generation and to store it permanently in deep geological structures beneath the land or sea surface. If CCS is successful existing fossil fuel reserves could be used whilst new forms of power generation with low CO2 emissions are developed. A few projects have been successfully demonstrating either capture or storage on limited scales, so it is established that the technical challenges are surmountable. Research is also demonstrating that the geological structures are in general robust for long term storage (for example oil deposits remain in place within geological strata). However geological structures are complex and natural sub surface gas deposits are known to outgas at the surface. Consequently it would be irresponsible to develop full scale CCS programmes without an understanding of the likelihood of leakage and the severity of impacts which might occur. The aim of this proposal is to greatly improve the understanding of the scale of impact a leakage from CCS systems might inflict on the ecosystem and to enable a comprehensive risk assessment of CCS.

More attention should clearly be paid to preventive measures. It is also essential to develop and establish contingency plans in case of escapes, to mitigate potentially negative socioeconomic and environmental impacts. Three mark-and-recapture experiments simulating escape incidents of sea bass (N = 1000 ind.), sea bream (N = 1000 ind.) and meagre (N = 1000 intl.) were carried out at three coastal fish farms located along the Mediterranean Coast of Spain. First, targeted experimental fishing trials in collaboration with artisanal netters were attempted at each location as potential fast-response contingency plans for recapturing escapees. Targeted fishing was successful on meagre (N = 38 ind., CPUE: 2.2 ind 10 m(-2) h(-1)) and sea bream (N = 8 ind., CPUE: 1.3 ind 10 m(-2) h(-1)), while no sea bass were recaptured. Secondly, recaptures reported from local fishermen (professional and recreational) during the study period were also considered. Altogether, total recapture rates were similar among the three species (sea bass: 5.4%; sea bream: 7.1%; meagre: 8.7%), although the spatial and temporal observations of recaptures varied among species. Recreational fishermen were the only contributors, recapturing 54 tagged sea bass (angling: 85%; spear-fishing: 15%) in mainly shallow coastal waters and about three km distance from the fish-farm during the weeks after release. A total of 71 escaped sea bream were recaptured by both recreational and artisanal fishermen, contributing similarly (recapture rates: 47.9% and 40.8% of total, respectively). Most sea bream recaptures were during the first nine days after release (86% of total recaptures), mainly near the farm facilities (< 3 km). The bulk of meagre recaptures were during the first two days after release (> 95%), mainly by experimental and artisanal netting (38 and 47 individuals respectively) again near the facility. In parallel, an underwater visual census was carried out at coastal locations and Natura 2000 sites in each study area, to assess the presence of escapees in marine habitats of special interest. Neither escaped sea bass nor escaped meagre were observed during underwater surveys, and only three tagged sea bream were found together at artificial reefs.

Nevertheless, many transient fish and invertebrate species rely on offshore surface waters for egg and larval transport before settling in coastal habitats, thereby potentially impacting the recruitment of transient species to coastal nursery habitats quite distant from the well site. We compared the utilization of salt-marsh habitats by transient and resident nekton before and after the DWH accident using data obtained from an oyster reef restoration project in coastal Alabama. Our sampling activities began in the summer preceding the DWH spill and continued almost two years following the accident. Overall, we did not find significant differences in the recruitment of marsh-associated resident and transient nekton in coastal Alabama following the DWH accident. Our results, therefore, provide little evidence for severe acute or persistent oil-induced impacts on organisms that complete their life cycle within the estuary and those that spent portions of their life history in potentially contaminated offshore surface waters prior to their recruitment to nearshore habitats. Our negative findings are consistent with other assessments of nekton in coastal vegetated habitats and bolster the notion that, despite the presence of localized hydrocarbon enrichments in coastal habitats outside of Louisiana the most severe oil impacts were relegated to coastal Louisiana and the deep sea. Analyzing all the information learned from this accident will undoubtedly provide a synthesis of what has or has not been affected in the Northern Gulf of Mexico, which when put in context with oil spill studies elsewhere should improve our ability to avert and manage the negative consequences of such accidents.",,,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,35,0,48,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USAUniv S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA",,,,2013-03-13,WOS:000316849200059,23516467,

The results of models support the conclusion that some of this variation can be explained by a higher sedimentary oxygen demand, which may be larger than water column respiration rates in summer. Proxies for organic loading to sediments reveal that carbon losses continue after accumulation, and results from other studies indicate that sediment oxygen demand is directly related to surface water phytoplankton production, which has increased because of higher nutrient loading from the Mississippi River watershed. The potential size of the hypoxic zone for a given nitrogen load has increased as a result and has doubled from 1980 to 2000.

To study the long-term impact of sustained and intense herbivory on seagrass meadows, we compared morphological, population and reproductive (flowering) parameters of Posidonia oceanica meadows inside a Marine Protected Area (MPA; where herbivore fish populations are very high) with unprotected meadows. In addition, we evaluated short-term seagrass responses by manipulating herbivore access to seagrass plots with caging experiments conducted inside the MPA. The density and individual sizes of the herbivorous fish Sarpa salpa were greater in the MPA, with a biomass 10 times higher than in unprotected areas. Fish bite marks on leaves were 50% more abundant inside the MPA. Shoot surface, rhizome sugar content and flower density were 80, 20 and 70% lower in the MPA, respectively, but shoot density was 30% higher in protected meadows than in unprotected meadows. The caging (fish exclusion) experiment generally corroborated these results, although the caging period was probably too short to produce changes in shoot density. P. oceanica responded to severe biomass removal by herbivores (80% of the photosynthetic biomass) and consequent reductions in carbon storage in the rhizome by reducing sexual reproduction (flowering intensity) and by gradually increasing clonal growth (increasing shoot density). This plasticity suggests an evolutionary adaptive mechanism to deal with historically high herbivore numbers and is evidence of the importance of herbivory as a controlling process in the structuring and functioning of seagrass meadows in the past.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,23,0,26,,,0171-8630,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Perpignan, CNRS EPHE, Ctr Biol & Ecol Trop & Mediterraneenne, USR 3278, F-66860 Perpignan, FranceCSIC, CEAB, Dept Marine Ecol, Blanes 17300, Girona, Spain",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000291953100017,,

SI,,,S3,S43,,,,,,,,,,,Article,APR 2013,2013,"The Black-capped Petrel Pterodroma hasitata was believed extinct throughout much of the 20th century. It is the only gadfly petrel currently known to breed in the Caribbean Basin. Now seriously endangered, the species is presumed extirpated from Martinique, Dominica, and Guadeloupe, and breeding populations currently occur only on Hispaniola and perhaps Cuba. A related form (now considered a full species) once bred, but is now apparently extinct, on Jamaica. The Black-capped Petrel breeding population may number as few as 500 breeding pairs. Remaining populations suffer from multiple threats to terrestrial and pelagic habitats, including harvest by humans and predation by introduced mammals. The exact sizes, locations, and detailed chronologies of all Black-capped Petrel breeding sites remain poorly studied, although major colonies are today apparently restricted to steep sea and inland cliffs along the La Selle Ridge in Hispaniola. The largest known breeding population occurs in Haiti, although there is continued discussion about a possible breeding site in Cuba in the Sierra Maestra mountain range. Accounts from Cuba are based on the unverified assumption that birds observed at sea just offshore of that island are breeding locally.All evidence at present indicates that waters in or adjacent to the Florida Current and the Gulf Stream between north Florida and southern Virginia provide the primary foraging range of Black-capped Petrels. A small foraging area just off of southeast Cuba has also been reported, but the extent and seasonal use of this area are unknown. Concentrations of birds can be found along the Gulf Stream in southeastern US waters throughout the year, but are particularly common in May, August, and late December through early January. Concentrations of adult birds during winter, when peak breeding activity is underway, suggest that breeding birds forage along the Gulf Stream while commuting to and from breeding colonies. Such long-distance foraging is certainly possible for Pterodroma species.Potential threats to Black-capped Petrels include introduced predators, human encroachment on breeding and foraging habitats, and offshore oil, gas, and wind energy development. Increased mercury levels associated with petroleum production also pose a potential threat, as the Black-capped Petrel seems to be highly susceptible to mercury bioaccumulation compared with other pelagic species. In addition, fires and other bright light sources are known to attract Black-capped Petrels, making collisions with wires and other structures on lighted ships and platforms a potential concern. Haitian social-economic instability and increasing habitat loss suggest the likelihood of further population declines and increasing vulnerability of the species to extinction.Our findings are in accord with the recent decision by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to evaluate the need for additional protection of the species and the primary foraging habitat off the southeastern United States under the Endangered Species Act (USFWS 2012). Additional conservation measures and research strategies that warrant further consideration include (1) protection, monitoring, and management of known breeding populations and nesting habitat in the Dominican Republic and Haiti through controlling predators, installing artificial nest burrows in appropriate sites and hiring local wardens at breeding sites during the nesting season; (2) local and regional training, education and public awareness (e.g. Blanchard & Nettleship 1992); (3) restoration of the original common name Diablotin to common usage to promote the historical and cultural importance of this species; (4) studies to determine the distribution and genetic variability in the remaining populations; and (5) studies of satellite-tagged birds to assess their seasonal and geographic use of pelagic habitats.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,10,0,10,,,1018-3337,2074-1235,,,,,,,,,,"N Carolina State Univ, NC Cooperat Fish and Wildlife Unit, US Geol Survey, Dept Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",,,,2013-04-01,BCI:BCI201600151167,,

In particular, they are present in the waters of the Great Australia Bight (GAB) over the summer months, where they are targeted by a commercial purse seine fishery. Arrival to and departure from the GAB represent important constraints on the valuable fishery, and this information is also now seen as essential for managing other activities within the GAB. As such, understanding the general patterns of the distribution of juvenile SBT and the environmental factors might be driving their distribution is valuable for establishing a baseline against which any future changes to population arrival or departure may be assessed. As part of a large investigation into the ecosystem of the GAB, data from a multi-year archival tagging program focused on juvenile SBT were used to construct statistical models of spatial usage within the residence areas of the GAB. Climatological data describing mixed-layer-depth, sea-surface temperatures, along with distance to the shelf break and coast, spatial position and time of year were used as predictor variables. Generalized additive models were fit which accounted for the seasonal progression of SBT into the GAB throughout their annual cycle and predicted the broad scale environmental features associated with their average distribution. The statistical models predicted habitat use by juvenile SBT in the proximity of the continental shelf break, with a preference for warmer waters in conjunction with deeper mixed layers. The model-generated annual distribution climatology can be used to plan the timing for a range of activities such as fishing, shipping, oil and gas exploration, and also inform development of forecasting applications. The predictions are also useful for determining large scale variation from the typical usage patterns of SBT in the GAB into the future.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,4,0,5,,,0967-0645,1879-0100,,,,,,,,,,"CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia",,,,2019-01-07,WOS:000454184200015,,

The power of systematic maps relies on the capacity to summarise and organise the areas or relationships most studied, and to highlight key gaps in the evidence base. The recent Italian technical referendum (2016) a public consultation inviting people to express their opinion by voting to change the rules on the length of licence duration and the decommissioning of offshore oil and gas platform drilling licences inspired the creation of a systematic map of evidence to scope and quantify the effects of off-shore extraction platforms on Mediterranean marine ecosystems. The map was aimed as a useful model to standardise a minimal informational threshold, which can inform public opinion at the beginning of any public consultation. Produced by synthesising scientific information, the map represents a reliable layer for any future sustainable strategy in the Mediterranean basin by: (i) providing a summary of the effects of marine gas and oil platforms on the Mediterranean marine ecosystem, (ii) describing the best known affected components on which the biggest monitoring efforts have been focused, and (iii) strengthening the science-policy nexus by offering a credible, salient and legitimate knowledge baseline to both public opinion and decision-makers. The map exercise highlights the knowledge gaps that need filling and taking into due consideration before future transnational and cross border monitoring and management plans and activities can be addressed.

This shows that the impact of DWH oil input on deep-sea sediments was generally limited to the area close to the spill site. Further, the PAHs source diagnostic analyses suggest a noticeable change in PAHs composition from higher to lower molecular weight dominance which reflects a change in source of PAHs in the past three years, back to the background composition.

In this study, we investigated the effect of basic marine environmental factors (electrolytes and soil minerals) on N2O hydrate formation kinetics to evaluate N2O hydrate formation as a potential way to mitigate an increasing amount of N2O produced by human activities. The formation kinetics of N2O hydrate with and without electrolytes (KCl, NaCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2) and soil minerals (Na-montmorillonite (Na-MMT), kaolinite, sphalerite, and illite) was experimentally monitored at 273.4 K and 30 bar. In a pure water system, the formation of N2O hydrate was 2.44 times slower than that of CO2 hydrate due to its relatively less association with water molecules. The formation kinetics of N2O hydrate was decelerated as expected by all electrolytes compared to that in pure water. This is due to the decrease of driving force for crystallization of N2O hydrates caused by the chemical potential reduction of hydrate-forming molecules, penetration of electrolytes into open cavities of hydrate structures, and steric effects of electrolytes. The formation kinetics of N2O hydrate was influenced by the combined characteristics of each soil mineral in suspension (surface area, pore size, concentrations of dissolved cations, and solvation energy). We further confirmed the applicability of N2O hydrate formation to offshore GHG sequestration in heterogeneous marine environments, using synthetic seawater and real marine sediments. Our study could provide knowledge fundamental to successful offshore GHG sequestration under seabed sediments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the nonlinear characteristic of the Morison equation for the horizontal wave force was analyzed using the dimensionless method based on the second-order Stokes wave theory. In addition, based on the computational fluid dynamics and finite volume method, adopting the Boundary wave method, a 3D numerical wave tank was established by the volume of fluid method. On account of the numerical results, the optimized relational expression of the maximum wave force and wave steepness was fitted by linear regression analysis method. The optimum equations of the maximum positive/negative horizontal force (Fmax/F-max) and wave steepness ([delta]) were Fmax = -0.89 + 110.44[delta] and F-max = -0.10-83.52[delta], and the correlation coefficients were 0.9795 and 0.9899, respectively. The coefficient of anti-rolling and coefficient of anti-slide were 2.11 and 3.96, respectively, under the action of waves with the largest wave steepness. The results indicated that the main non-linear factor for the horizontal wave force acting on the artificial reef was wave steepness and the nonlinear effect enhances with increase in the number value. Taking a type of frustum cones artificial reef as an example, the maximum positive and negative horizontal wave force and the corresponding wave and pressure fields around the artificial reef were obtained. According to the numerical simulation results, the horizontal wave force of the artificial reef appeared to change periodically along with wave motion and increased with wave steepness. The results of stability calibration showed that the frustum cones artificial reef remained fairly stable on the sea floor at different test conditions, and it is well suited to the much larger wave heights in the sea.",,,,,,,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,,,2095-9869,,,,,,,,,,,"China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Beijing, 100036, China",,,,2020-08-03,ZOOREC:ZOOR15608061966,,

In 2009, the Minerals Management Service issued a moratorium on reef proposals outside of established planning areas in response to public criticism and NGO assertions that Rigs-to-Reef was becoming a de facto Ocean Dumping Program. In 2013, the moratorium was lifted, and in a recently released Rigs-to-Reef Interim Policy Document 2013-07, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement specified that no departures from regulatory requirements will be granted for toppled structures.

In the Mediterranean Sea, the zooxanthellate coral Oculina patagonica (Scleractinia, Oculinidae) can turn algal forests into coral-dominated ecosystems and provides a case study for examining how zooxanthellate corals can affect the structure of algal-dominated shallow-water rocky ecosystems in temperate areas. Our goal was to provide a quantitative baseline assessment of O. patagonica demographics along similar to 1300 km of the Mediterranean Iberian coast and relate them to environmental parameters. The highest coral success was in the South Balearic Sea zone, where the populations exhibited >6-fold higher mean living coral cover, lower partial colony mortality and colony size distributions indicating that the populations in this zone were growing faster than those in the peripheral south-west (North Alboran Sea) and north-east (Mid and North Balearic Sea, and West Gulf of Lyons) zones. The coral demographics (i.e., density, cover, and skewness and kurtosis coefficients of colony size distributions) were positively correlated with each other and the annual mean seawater temperature (ST), 10th-ST percentile (P10th-ST), 90th-ST percentile (P90th-ST) and photosynthetically active radiation at 3-m depth (PAR-3m), but they were negatively correlated with chlorophyll-a. Based on these results, we identified the following thresholds that may constrain the growth of O. patagonica colonies and populations: annual mean ST <19-20 degrees C, P10th-ST <14 degrees C, P90th-ST <25 degrees C and N27 degrees C, and PAR-3m <30 mol photons m(-2) day(-1). The species abundance along the Iberian coast conforms to the abundant-center pattern of distribution. However, the coral demographics indicated that this pattern was not only related to the time of establishment but also to differences in coral population growth, which were correlated with key environmental parameters. Our results contribute understanding of the forces driving population growth of O. patagonica and support the hypothesis of an ongoing coral-mediated tropicalization of macroalgae-dominated temperate ecosystems.

At 19 sites within three seagrass meadows in the coastal waters of Zanzibar, Tanzania, species cover was estimated along with three community traits hypothesized to influence sediment OC storage (above and belowground biomass, seagrass tissue nitrogen content, and shoot density). Sediments within four biogeographic zones (fore reef, reef flat, tidal channel, and seagrass meadow) of the landscape were characterized, and sediment cores were collected within seagrass meadows to quantify OC storage in the top 25 cm and top meter of the sediment. We identified five distinct seagrass communities that had notable differences in the plant traits, which were all residing within a thin veneer (ranging from 19 to 78 cm thick) of poorly sorted, medium to coarsely grained carbonate sands on top of carbonate rock. One community (B), dominated by Thalassodendron ciliatum, contained high amounts of above (972 +/- 74 g DW m(-2)) and belowground (682 +/- 392 g DW m(-2)) biomass composed of low-elemental-quality tissues (leaf C: N = 24.5; rhizome C: N = 97). While another community (C), dominated by small-bodied ephemeral seagrass species, had significantly higher shoot density (4178 shoots m(-2)). However, these traits did not translate into differences in sediment OC storage and across all communities the percentage of OC within sediments was similar and low (ranging from 0.15% to 0.75 %), as was the estimated OC storage in the top 25 cm (14.1 +/- 2.2 Mg C ha(-1)) and top meter (33.9 +/- 7.7 Mg C ha(-1)) of sediment. These stock estimates are considerably lower than the global average (194.2 +/- 20.2Mg C ha(-1)) reported for other seagrass ecosystems and are on the lower end of the range of estimates reported for the tropical Indo-Pacific bioregion (1.9 to 293Mg C ha(-1)). The uniformly low OC storage across communities, despite large inputs of low-quality belowground tissues in community B, indicates that the geophysical conditions of the coarse, shallow sediments at our sites were not conducive to OC stabilization and outweighed any variation in the quantity or quality of seagrass litter inputs. These results add to a growing body of evidence showing that geophysical conditions of the sediment modulate the importance of plant traits in regards to retention of OC within blue carbon ecosystems and cautions against the use of plant traits as a proxy for sediment OC storage across all seagrass ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,22,1,0,0,20,0,25,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,,,,,,"Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res, Fahrenheitstr 6, D-28359 Bremen, GermanyUniv Bremen, Bibliothekstr 1, D-28359 Bremen, GermanyUniv Dar Es Salaam, Inst Marine Sci, Mizingani Rd, Zanzibar, Tanzania",,,,2018-08-06,WOS:000440016500001,,

The present study evaluated the feasibility and capacity of using the green-lipped mussel Perna viridis as a biofilter to remove farming wastes from fish rafts. Spats of green-lipped mussels were transplanted to artificial reefs deployed under fish farms in Hong Kong. After a 1 yr period of growth and acclimatization, the nutrient scope for growth (SFG) of the transplanted mussels was quantified in situ through a series of bimonthly measurements of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus changes. The metabolic acquisition and expenditure of mussels exhibited considerable temporal fluctuation during the study period, owing to changes in exogenous environmental conditions such as food availability, water temperature and dissolved oxygen levels, and autogenous physiological status such as the reproductive cycle. For a standard Perna viridis of 70 rum shell length, the average SFG of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus was 170.9, 18.6 and 4.3 mu g h(-1), respectively. As a result, the annual nutrient assimilation capacities of a 70 nun mussel for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus were 1476.9, 160.3 and 36.7 mg, respectively.

We assessed the significance of these protected areas to albatrosses by: (i) documenting commuting flights between Hawaiian breeding sites and the California Current System (CCS); (ii) quantifying albatross dispersion patterns on the central California continental shelf and slope, and (iii) characterizing albatross habitats within sanctuary waters using concurrent satellite-tracking data and vessel-based sightings. Chick-rearing albatrosses commuted from their colony on Tern Island, Hawaii (23.878 degrees N, 166.288 degrees W), to the CCS (34-48 degrees N) and two of the eight satellite-tracked birds entered the marine sanctuaries.

These functions and services could, however, be strongly impacted by anthropogenic activities such as livestock grazing - a common practice in the Wadden Sea salt marshes located in North west of Europe. To assess the impact of grazing on soil parameters, a total number of eight soil cores (circle divide: 18 cm; L: 50 cm) were collected in areas with and without livestock grazing, and scanned using a Computed Tomography (CT) to characterize soil parameters including soil macroporosity, sediment density, and pores connectivity. Subsequently, sub-samples were taken for determination of soil moisture content (%) and bulk density (g cm(-3)). To account for the impact of grazing on soil drainage after tidal inundations, water table relative to soil surface was monitored during two flooding events. Our results demonstrated that grazed salt marsh has higher top-soil bulk density, and lower macroporosity and pore connectivity, than ungrazed marsh, due to soil compaction by livestock grazing. Moreover, grazed marsh has slower water drainage and that might keep the soil waterlogged for a longer period of time which has implications on lowering decomposition rate due to lower soil redox. This study provides evidence that grazing alters physical soil parameters in salt marsh.

Based on this methodological advance, we reconstruct SNW-based deepwater [CO32-] for core WP7 from the western tropical Pacific since 250ka. Secular variation in the SNW proxy documents little change in deep Pacific [CO32-] between the Last Glacial Maximum and the Holocene. Further back in time, deepwater [CO32-] shows long-term increases from marine isotope stage (MIS) 5e to MIS 3 and from early MIS 7 to late MIS 6, consistent with the coral reef hypothesis that the deep Pacific Ocean carbonate system responded to declining shelf carbonate production during these two intervals. During deglaciations, we have evidence of [CO32-] peaks coincident with Terminations 2 and 3, which suggests that a breakdown of oceanic vertical stratification drove a net transfer of CO2 from the ocean to the atmosphere, causing spikes in carbonate preservation (i.e., the deglacial ventilation hypothesis). During MIS 4, a transient decline in SNW-based [CO32-], along with other reported [CO32-] and/or dissolution records, implies that increased deep-ocean carbon storage resulted in a global carbonate dissolution event.

The development of coastal and offshore resources, such as oil and gas and minerals, involves sea floor engineering in remote, complex, and sometimes hazardous environments. Optimum engineering design and construction practice require detailed surveys of sea floor geomorphology, geologic conditions on the sea bed and to various depths beneath it, combined with geotechnical properties of the sediments and oceanographic information. Integrated site survey models attempt to predict conditions and process frequencies and magnitudes relevant to the engineering design lifetimes of sea floor installations, such as cables, pipelines, production platforms, as well as supporting coastal infrastructure such as jetties, wharves, bridges and harbors. Recent use of deep water areas for oil and gas production, pipelines, and cable routes are also showing that the world's greatest slopes, beyond the continental shelves contain exciting, exotic, and enigmatic geomorphological features and processes. Safe and cost-effective engineering use of these regions depends upon exciting new technical and conceptual advances for understanding sea floor geomorphology - a task which has barely begun.

Coded-wire tags were implanted in nose cartilage, left cheek muscle, the nape, dorsal musculature, and the caudal peduncle. Three weeks after tagging, all implant locations tested showed tag retention over 97% except for those implanted in the dorsal musculature (90%). No additional tag loss was found between 3 and 6 weeks after tagging regardless of implant location or fish size. We selected the nape musculature for larger-scale tagging because of high tag retention and ease of tagging. Retention of CWTs in the nape after 6 months was 99% (n=285). Visible implant elastomer (VIE) tags were implanted in muscular and fin tissue of juvenile snapper and retention rates were >= 95% (after 6 weeks) for all implant locations except for anal fin muscles (87% tag retention). In a separate study, 6 months after tagging, fish size-at-tagging and the number of VIE marks implanted in the caudal fin significantly influenced tag retention (two-way analysis of variance, P=0.026). After experimental stock enhancement releases, divers 17-20 m deep, found that VIEs in caudal fins were highly visible, but those in the nose area were difficult to see due to pigmentation over the tags and fish orientation. Tag color influenced tag visibility and red and orange elastomer tags were the most visible among eight colors tested (red, orange, yellow, green, pink, black, blue, and purple).

Presently, a ROMS operational implementation provides every day hydrodynamic and sea level 3-days forecasts, while a second one models the most relevant biogeochemical properties, and a third one (two-way coupled with the Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) model) deals with extreme waves forecast. Such operational models provide support to civil and environmental protection activities (e.g., driving sub-models for oil-spill dispersion, storm surge, coastal morphodynamic changes during storms, saline wedge intrusion along Po River), in a growing context of stake-holders at regional, national and international level. Besides, ROMS and COAWST research based activities are also carried out, mostly aiming at investigating sediment transport, eggs and larvae dispersion, hypoxic events in the basin; through successive nesting very high resolutions nearshore the Italian coast can be reached, allowing to simulate river mouth environments and artificial reefs.

Modeling factors that enhance or inhibit krill aggregations, or 'hotspots', will benefit management of marine predators of conservation concern and contribute to ecosystem approaches to fisheries. Here, we link an oceanographic model (ROMS) and an individual-based model (IBM) parameterized for the krill species Euphausia pacifica to test the hypothesis that occurrences of krill hotspots are disassociated from centers of upwelling along the central-northern California coast due to strong advective currents that transport zooplankton away from the productive continental shelf environment. We compare the distribution of modeled to observed hotspots derived from hydroacoustic surveys from 2000 to 2008. Both acoustic data and modeled hotspots show the greater Gulf of the Farallones and Monterey Canyon as areas of persistent krill hotspots. In this large retention zone, we found no clear relationships between krill hotspots and proxies of upwelling. In contrast, modeled hotspots were associated with reduced upwelling (warmer sea surface temperature [SST] and lower alongshore currents) to the north of Pt. Reyes, and with enhanced upwelling (cooler SST and greater alongshore currents) south of Pt. Sur. Our model highlights the role spatial variability of physical forcing plays in determining the likelihood of krill hotspots forming in particular regions.

Drifter data were collected during spawning events in 1997 and 1998 at the Flower Garden Banks (FGB) and from the Surface Current and Lagrangian Drift Program in 1993 (Niiler et al., Surface current and langrangian-drift program. Unpublished Report, U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, 1997, 10pp). Observed and simulated tracks showed that likely coral dispersal is driven by five circulation modes. Mode 1 is a cyclonic motion reaching the Texas shelf and possible cyclonic motion along the shelf toward Mexico. Mode 2 is an entrainment by offshore eddies causing likely larval transport into deep water (> 200 m). Mode 3 consists of a continuous eastward movement that reaches 87.5 degreesW. Mode 4 consists of recirculating hows over or near the FGB. Mode 5 is a cross-basin transport that ends near the Florida Keys in 50-60 days. Modes 1 and 4 can bring larvae back to the FGB within 24-30 days after spawning creating conditions for self-seeding. Offshore eddies near the FGB, Modes 2 and 5, generate offshore transport that can carry coral larvae to reefs in Mexico and Florida. Only similar to 43% of the drifters leave the northwestern Gulf shelf, which implies that most coral larvae can remain on the shelf through Modes I, 3, and 4. Mode 3 suggests eastward larval dispersal and under influence of the Mississippi River plume where they can be adversely affected by low salinity, low temperature, and high sedimentation which limit recruitment on oil and gas platforms. possible effects of hurricanes on larval dispersal include reduced travel time, considerable displacements, and physical damage by strong turbulence. Nineteen outer shelf banks were contacted by actual and simulated drifter tracks, but only 10 are suitable for coral larvae settlement given the substrate and crest depth. These 10 banks could represent a doubling of reef area relative to the FGB, i.e., 5.35 km(2) shallower than 55 m, if successfully colonized by coral larvae. Drifter tracks also contacted 129 major oil and gas fixed platforms. Potential larvae recruitment by these contacts could increase the reef area in the northwestern Gulf by 38% compared to the FGB, and support eastward propagation of corals. A majority of actual and simulated drifter contacts occurs within 40 km of the FGB; contacts increased at 70 km and beyond 150 km from the FGB. This contact distribution suggest a high potential for self-seeding, and connectivity of Gulf reefs at long time scales.

Vermilion Snapper (139-535mm TL) were collected from May 2015 through October 2016 from artificial and natural reefs in the north-central GOM. Ages ranged from 0.8 to 13years, and there was no significant difference in growth between males and females. Nonlinear curve fitting was used to estimate growth parameters and Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to determine relative model fit. The two-parameter von Bertalanffy growth function provided the best model fit and lowest AIC score. Histological examination indicated that Vermilion Snapper are batch spawners with asynchronous oocyte development. Additionally, 17% of female Vermilion Snapper in the actively spawning subphase had 24-h postovulatory follicles (POF) suggesting daily spawning is occurring. No immature fish of either sex were collected during this study. Both histologically determined phases and gonadosomatic index patterns defined a spawning season occurring from April through September. The spawning interval for Vermilion Snapper, 1.3 and 2.1d, was estimated using the hydrated oocyte and POF methods, respectively. Batch fecundity estimates from 5,497 to 284,468 eggs per batch were determined using fish macroscopically classified as actively spawning (n=25), and total annual fecundity was estimated to range from 450,754 to 32,549,776 eggs per spawning season.

Initiation of this response coincides with the onset of the carbon isotope excursion (CIE) but precedes the benthic foraminiferal mass extinction. The top-to-bottom succession in the biotic response indicates that the surface ocean/atmosphere was affected before the deep sea. The earliest stage of the faunal response entailed a conspicuous turnover within the shallow-dwelling genus Acarinina and a succession of stratigraphic first appearances. The genus Morozovella, large (>180 m) biserial planktonics, and A. wilcoxensis are all restricted to the lower CIE within this PETM section. Acarininid populations crashed as the ocean/climate system ameliorated during the CIE recovery, reflecting atypical surface water conditions. This transient decline in acarininids is paralleled by a marked increase in carbonate content of sediments. It is postulated that this interval of carbonate enrichment, and its unusual microfauna, reflects enhanced carbon storage within reservoirs of the global carbon cycle other than the marine carbonate system (sensu Broecker et al., 1993, doi:10.1029/93PA00423; Ravizza et al., 2001, doi:10.1029/2000PA000541).

J,,,,,,,,,,,Foraging ecology of great black-backed gulls and their impact on Atlantic puffin populations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2019,2019,"Populations of many species of seabirds have declined significantly over the past 30 years, with climate change identified as a primary cause. One species undergoing large declines is the Atlantic puffin, a species of high conservation concern that has recently been re-classified as 'vulnerable' by BirdLife International. The reduction in availability of prey (sandeels) has been proposed as a principal cause for declines, however, predation by predatory seabirds such as the great black-backed gull and great skua may also play a role, especially as these species are showing marked increases in many locations. Since both seabird predator and prey are legally protected, this may lead to wildlife conflicts, especially if management measures such as culling are proposed. Furthermore, conflicts will be shaped by the effects of other pressures on both species e.g. great black-backed gulls and puffins are potentially at risk from the development of offshore renewable energy installations such as wind farms and from the ingestion of [micro]plastics. It is therefore vital that detailed information is available on the interactions between the species involved in order to ascertain the population dynamic consequences of this predator-prey relationship, and to devise effective management strategies to alleviate this wildlife conflict.The PhD would examine the consequences of the significant increase in the great black-backed gull population on the Isle of May, south-east Scotland, on the Atlantic puffin populations. Atlantic puffins on the Isle of May have declined by more than a third in the last decade, while the great black-backed gulls have more than doubled over the same period. Past work at this colony has demonstrated that the majority of predation is undertaken by a subset of specialist gulls that generally target juvenile puffins [1, 2]. However, the extent to which this predation has population-level effects on puffins, and whether this is predicted to change in the future, has not been tested. Further, it is not clear whether potential effects on puffins are apparent more widely, because of limited knowledge of the population trends of great black-backed gull and the extent of interactions with local puffin populations. Therefore the project would involve focussed research on the Isle of May and analyses at the national scale to address the following key questions: a) What is the degree of foraging specialism among individual gulls? b) What is the age structure of predated puffins? c) What are the population-level consequences of predation by gulls on the puffin population? d) What are the predicted changes in puffin and gull population sizes associated with future changes in predator-prey interactions on the Isle of May and at the UK scale? e) What are the predicted changes in populations of both species caused by multiple drivers including offshore renewable effects and ingestion of marine plastics? Addressing these questions would provide conservation managers with the evidence they need to select the best options for alleviating this wildlife conflict.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2302685,,,,,,,,University of the Highlands and Islands,University of the Highlands and Islands,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15349464,,

To address this information gap, we sampled nearshore fish assemblages with a beach seine and a small bottom trawl at six stations in the northeastern Chukchi Sea in August 2007, 2008, and 2009, and in September 2009. Catch and species composition differed by gear type and between sample periods, including the two in 2009. A total of 16 039 fish representing 18 species were captured in 24 beach seine hauls, and 3108 fish representing 24 species were captured in 48 trawl tows. Beach seine catch was dominated by capelin (83%), and trawl catch was dominated by Arctic cod (56%). Species that were good discriminators between gear types were capelin (seine) and slender eelblenny (trawl), and unidentified small sculpins were the most common taxa caught with both gear types. Capelin and Arctic cod captured by either gear type were mostly juveniles (judging by size). Variability among sampling periods in catch and species composition within gear types can likely be attributed to annual variations in environmental conditions, including differences in water temperature (range: 2 degrees-9 degrees C). The shallow nearshore environment of the northeastern Chukchi Sea provides important habitat for many fish species and is extremely vulnerable to disturbance. Loss of sea ice from global warming may open up formerly inaccessible areas to oil and gas exploration, vessel traffic, and commercial fishing. Thus, long-term monitoring of nearshore fish assemblages in the Alaskan Arctic is necessary for managers to make informed decisions in this fragile environment.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,6,0,13,,,0004-0843,1923-1245,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Juneau, AK 99801 USAUS Army Corps Engineers, Elmendorf AFB, AK 99506 USA",,,,2013-11-07,WOS:000325309500002,,

Because there apparently is sufficient onshore storage in the northeastern and midwestern United States, offshore storage is not necessary or economical unless there are additional costs or suitability issues associated with the onshore reservoirs.

Sparse colonization on SCAR by adult Macrocystis occurred within 6 months after reef construction via drifters (i.e. individuals from neighboring kelp beds that became dislodged and set adrift). The abundance of drifters on SCAR declined exponentially with distance from the nearest source population (San Mateo), suggesting that San Mateo was the likely source of drifters. Dense recruitment of small Macrocystis sporophytes was observed within 8 months of reef construction. The density of recruits on SCAR showed an initial increase with distance from San Mateo before declining exponentially. Nonetheless, substantial recruitment was observed at the most distant locations on SCAR located 3.5 km from San Mateo. In contrast to drifters, the density of recruits was positively correlated to the bottom cover of artificial reef substrate.

Based on 88 bathyal fish and crustaceans (Decapoda and Peracarida) dominant in these communities, we compared the maximum depth of occurrence (MDO) of (upper) middle-slope species and the minimum depth of occurrence (mDO) of lower-slope dwelling species. Mid-slope fish, decapods, peracarids and, within the latter, amphipods and cumaceans had a deeper MDO in the cCS than in the SWB. Depth differences between MDO of species were significant for all taxa, except isopods. In the same way, lower slope fish and decapods had a shallower mDO in the SWB than in the cCS. Within peracarids, the dominant taxon (amphipods) also followed this trend. Depth differences in mDO of species between the areas were significant for decapods and for amphipods (not for fish, nor all peracarids nor cumaceans). In summary, most taxa showed a deeper depth distribution of middle-slope species in the cCS, and a shallower depth distribution of lower-slope dwelling species in the SWB. This suggests that the whole community, from small detritus-feeders (peracarids) to top predators (fish) have a similar response to a common signal. Much basic information on the biology and possible environmental factors affecting deepsea species distribution is not available, so causes of the trends demonstrated here cannot be fully evaluated. In spite of these obvious limitations, we have shown that (1) mesopelagic decapods (e.g., Gennadas elegans and Sergia robusta), with a higher dependence upon primary sources of food close to the surface primary production, showed greater differences in their mDO between the areas than benthopelagic (e.g., A canthephyra eximia, Nenzatocarcinus exilis) and benthic (e.g., Stereomastis sculpta, Munida tenuimana, Geryon longipes) species, and (2) fish at lower trophic levels, deduced from fractional trophic levels, showed higher differences in the MDO than fish at higher trophic levels. Trophic position of species in food webs seems the most important factor affecting the distributional differences between contrasting areas. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The discharges contain dispersed crude oil, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkylphenols (APs), metals, and many other constituents of environmental relevance. Risk-based regulation, greener offshore chemicals and improved cleaning systems have reduced environmental risks of PW discharges, but PW is still the largest operational source of oil pollution to the sea from the offshore petroleum industry. Monitoring surveys find detectable exposures in caged mussel and fish several km downstream from PW outfalls, but biomarkers indicate only mild acute effects in these sentinels. On the other hand, increased concentrations of DNA adducts are found repeatedly in benthic fish populations, especially in haddock. It is uncertain whether increased adducts could be a long-term effect of sediment contamination due to ongoing PW discharges, or earlier discharges of oil-containing drilling waste. Another concern is uncertainty regarding the possible effect of PW discharges in the sub-Arctic Southern Barents Sea. So far, research suggests that sub-arctic species are largely comparable to temperate species in their sensitivity to PW exposure. Larval deformities and cardiac toxicity in fish early life stages are among the biomarkers and adverse outcome pathways that currently receive much attention in PW effect research.

In particular, CCS technologies are still presented as a solution to reach ambitious climate targets. However, avoiding the required Gt of CO2 emissions by investing in CCS technologies supposes the development of carbon storage capacities. This analysis, conducted with TIAM-FR and based on a wide review of geological storage potential and various data, aims to discuss the impact of this potential on the development of the CCS option. We also specify a scenario allowing the exclusion of onshore storage due to a hypothetic policy considering public resistance to onshore storage, and carbon transport costs variation effects. The implementation of CCS is less impacted by the level of carbon storage potential - except in the lowest case of availability - than by the type of sequestration site. However, the development of CCS is lower at the end of the period in the case of a decrease in carbon storage potential. Indeed, the question of type of storage site appears to have a greater impact, with an arbitrage between deep saline aquifers and depleted basins and enhanced recovery. Doubling the cost of carbon transport does not limit the penetration of carbon capture technologies, but it does impact the choice of site. Finally, a limitation of onshore storage could have a significant impact on the penetration of the CCS option. The explanation for this limited deployment of CCS is thus the higher cost of offshore storage more than the level of storage potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the number and variety of human activities affecting ecosystems, relatively few empirical studies are adequately comprehensive to inform these decisions. Consequently, management often turns to expert judgment for information. Drawing on methods from decision science, we offer a method for eliciting expert judgment to (1) quantitatively estimate the relative vulnerability of ecosystems to stressors, (2) help prioritize the management of stressors across multiple ecosystems, (3) evaluate how experts give weight to different criteria to characterize vulnerability of ecosystems to anthropogenic stressors, and (4) identify key knowledge gaps. We applied this method to the California Current region in order to evaluate the relative vulnerability of 19 marine ecosystems to 53 stressors associated with human activities, based on surveys from 107 experts. When judging the relative vulnerability of ecosystems to stressors, we found that experts primarily considered two criteria: the ecosystem's resistance to the stressor and the number of species or trophic levels affected. Four intertidal ecosystems (mudflat, beach, salt marsh, and rocky intertidal) were judged most vulnerable to the suite of human activities evaluated here. The highest vulnerability rankings for coastal ecosystems were invasive species, ocean acidification, sea temperature change, sea level rise, and habitat alteration from coastal engineering, while offshore ecosystems were assessed to be most vulnerable to ocean acidification, demersal destructive fishing, and shipwrecks. These results provide a quantitative, transparent, and repeatable assessment of relative vulnerability across ecosystems to any ongoing or emerging human activity.

There are two major sources for PAHs to marine ecosystems in Norway: the inshore smelter industry, and offshore oil and gas production activities. A distinction is generally made between petrogenic (oil-derived) and pyrogenic (combustion-derived) PAHs. Although petrogenic PAHs appear to be bioavailable to a large extent, pyrogenic PAHs are often associated with soot particles and less available for uptake into organisms. There is extensive evidence linking sediment-associated PAHs to induction of phase-I enzymes, development of DNA adducts, and eventually neoplastic lesions in fish. Most studies have focused on high-molecular-weight, carcinogenic PAHs such as benzo[ a] pyrene. It is less clear how two- and three-ring PAHs affect fish, and there is even experimental evidence to indicate that these chemicals may inhibit some components of the phase I system rather than produce induction.

Initiation of this response coincides with the onset of the carbon isotope excursion (CIE) but precedes the benthic foraminiferal mass extinction. The top-to-bottom succession in the biotic response indicates that the surface ocean/atmosphere was affected before the deep sea. The earliest stage of the faunal response entailed a conspicuous turnover within the shallow-dwelling genus Acarinina and a succession of stratigraphic first appearances. The genus Morozovella, large (>180 m) biserial planktonics, and A. wilcoxensis are all restricted to the lower CIE within this PETM section. Acarininid populations crashed as the ocean/climate system ameliorated during the CIE recovery, reflecting atypical surface water conditions. This transient decline in acarininids is paralleled by a marked increase in carbonate content of sediments. It is postulated that this interval of carbonate enrichment, and its unusual microfauna, reflects enhanced carbon storage within reservoirs of the global carbon cycle other than the marine carbonate system [sensu Broecker et al., 1993 ; Ravizza et al., 2001 ].",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012-10-20,DRCI:DATA2012208001797026,,

Microzooplankton grazing is an important mortality factor in coccolithophore blooms, however little is currently known regarding the mortality (or growth) rates within non-bloom populations. Measurements of coccolithophore calcite production (CP) and dilution experiments to determine microzooplankton (<= 63 mu m) grazing rates were made during a spring cruise (April 2015) at the Central Celtic Sea (CCS), shelf edge (CS2), and within an adjacent April bloom of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi at station J2.CP at CCS ranged from 10.4 to 40.4 mu mol C m(-3) d(-1) and peaked at the height of the spring phytoplankton bloom (peak chlorophyll-a concentrations similar to 6 mg m(-3)). Cell normalised calcification rates declined from similar to 1.7 to similar to 0.2 pmol C cell(-1) d(-1), accompanied by a shift from a mixed coccolithophore species community to one dominated by the more lightly calcified species E. huxleyi and Calciopappus caudatus. At the CCS, coccolithophore abundance increased from 6 to 94 cells mL(-1), with net growth rates ranging from 0.06 to 0.21 d(-1) from the 4th to the 28th April. Estimates of intrinsic growth and grazing rates from dilution experiments, at the CCS ranged from 0.01 to 0.86 d(-1) and from 0.01 to 1.32 d(-1), respectively, which resulted in variable net growth rates during April. Microzooplankton grazers consumed 59 to >100% of daily calcite production at the CCS. Within the E. huxleyi bloom a maximum density of 1986 cells mL(-1) was recorded, along with CP rates of 6000 mu mol C m(-3) d(-1) and an intrinsic growth rate of 0.29 d(-1), with similar to 80% of daily calcite production being consumed.Our results show that microzooplankton can exert strong top-down control on both bloom and non-bloom coccolithophore populations, grazing over 60% of daily growth (and calcite production). The fate of consumed calcite is unclear, but may be lost either through dissolution in acidic food vacuoles, and subsequent release as CO2, or export to the seabed after incorporation into small faecal pellets.

We have analyzed hydrocarbon concentrations in eleven sediment cores collected from northern Baffin Bay during 2008 and 2009 Amundsen expeditions and have examined the hydrocarbon compositions in both pre- and post-industrial periods (i.e., before and after 1900) to assess the sources of hydrocarbons, and their temporal and spatial variabilities. Concentrations of Sigma PAHs ranged from 341 to 2693 ng g(-1) dw, with concentrations in cores from sites within the North Water (NOW) Polynya generally higher. Individual PAH concentrations did not exceed concentrations of concern for marine aquatic life, with one exception found in a core collected within the NOW (one of the seven sediment core samples). Hydrocarbon biomarkers, including alkane profiles, OEP (odd-to-even preference), and TAR (terrigenous/aquatic ratios) values indicated that organic carbon at all sites is derived from both terrigenous higher plants and marine algae, the former being of greater significance at coastal sites, and the latter at the deepest sites at the southern boundary of the NOW. Biomarker ratios and chemical profiles indicate that petrogenic sources dominate over combustion sources, and thus long-range atmospheric transport is less significant than inputs from weathering. Present-day and historic pre-1900 hydrocarbon concentrations exhibited less than an order of magnitude difference for most compounds at all sites. The dataset presented here provides a baseline record of hydrocarbon concentrations in Baffin Bay sediments in advance of offshore exploration and increased shipping activities.

As a result, certain restrictive regulations concerning drilling operations in the vicinity of the well documented coral reefs and biostromal communities at the East and West Flower Gardens were established by BLM, and Signal Oil Company was required to provide a biological and geological baseline study of the less well known Stetson Bank before a drilling permit could be issued. Considering the almost total lack of knowledge of the geology and biotic communities associated with the South Texas OCS banks lying in or near lease blocks to be offered for sale in 1975, BLM contracted with Texas A&M University to provide the biological and geological baseline information required to facilitate judgments as to the extent and nature of restrictive regulations on drilling near these banks which might be required to insure their protection. In pursuit of this, scientists from Texas A&M University were to direct their attention toward assessments of ground fish populations, unique biological and geological features, substratum type and distribution, and the biotic and geologic relationships between these banks and those farther north.

Corals successfully colonised the artificial reef, despite the relatively harsh environmental conditions at the site (annual water temperature range 18-32 degrees C, intermittent high turbidity, frequent cyclones, frequent nearby ship movements). Coral settlement to the artificial reef was examined by terracotta tile deployments, and later stages of coral community development were examined by in-situ visual surveys within fixed 25 x 25 cm quadrats on the rock and concrete substrates. Mean coral density on the tiles varied from 113 +/- 17 SE to 909 +/- 85 SE per m(2) over five deployments, whereas mean coral density in the quadrats was only 6.0 +/- 1.0 SE per m(2) at eight months post construction, increasing to 24.0 +/- 2.1 SE per m(2) at 62 months post construction. Coral taxa colonising the artificial reef were a subset of those on the surrounding natural reef, but occurred in different proportions-Pseudosiderastrea tayami, Mycedium elephantotus and Leptastrea purpurea being disproportionately abundant on the artificial reef.

Assessing the vulnerabilities of seabirds to maritime hazards requires an understanding of their species distribution, and a means for combining this information across groups. Using at-sea survey data gathered as part of a regional monitoring program, an efficient framework for integrating multi-species data was developed. Survey data was incorporated within a distance sampling framework to generate bias-corrected seabird densities for an area of over 730,000 km(2) size, which were used to construct multiple species distribution models (SDMs). The structural difficulties associated with sampling sparsely distributed individuals that also occur in large, localized concentrations led to the use of three modelling techniques potentially well suited for this type of data: negative binomial, ''hurdle'', and random forest methods. Predicted abundances were combined to produce an ensemble forecast, which met or exceeded the accuracy of predictions from the individual models. Multi-species potential sensitivity maps were developed to identify core areas, confirming the general importance of physiographic features such as the shelf break and bathymetry. Distribution was also seasonally influenced, with spring and winter standing out as periods of peak importance. When combined with an oil pollution layer derived from aerial surveillance, vulnerability was highest in the vicinity of major ports (e.g., Halifax and Sydney, Nova Scotia). However, the vulnerability map also indicated lower but widespread levels of oiling risk throughout the shelf, presumably associated with persistently high levels of shipping traffic and ongoing petroleum extraction and exploration. Outside of this region, migratory connectivity is expected to expose seabirds to a wider network of hazards and further underscores the need for the coordinated and routine collection of marine hazard data alongside at-sea distributional data.

In this study, we investigate the effect of sea-level rise on benthos, vegetation, and ecosystem diversity in a tidal wetland in west Wales, the UK. Present relationships between plant communities and environmental variables were investigated through 50 plots at which vegetation (species and coverage), hydrological (surface or groundwater depth, conductivity) and soil (matrix chroma, presence or absence of mottles, organic content, particle size) data were collected. Benthic communities were sampled at intervals along a continuum from saline to freshwater. To ascertain future changes to the wetlands' hydrology, a GIS-based empirical model was developed. Using a LiDAR derived land surface, the relative effect of peat accumulation and rising sea levels were modelled over 200 years to determine how frequently portions of the wetland will be inundated by mean sea level, mean high water spring and mean high water neap conditions. The model takes into account changing extents of peat accumulation as hydrological conditions alter.Model results show that changes to the wetland hydrology will initially be slow. However, changes in frequency and extent of inundation reach a tipping point 125 to 175 years from 2010 due to the extremely low slope of the wetland. From then onwards, large portions of the wetland become flooded at every flood tide and saltwater intrusion becomes more common. This will result in a reduction in marsh biodiversity with plant communities switching toward less diverse and occasionally monospecific communities that are more salt tolerant.While the loss of tidal freshwater wetland is in line with global predictions, simulations suggest that in the Teifi marshes the loss will be slow at first, but then rapid. While there will be a decrease in biodiversity, the model indicated that at least for one ecosystem service, carbon storage, there is potential for an increase in the near future.

Based on a review of 21 windfarm projects (> 50 MW) approved by the Scottish Government we provide an overview of current practice and identify and discuss how the 12 principles of the Ecosystem Approach can help identify options for more appropriate impact assessment. These include defining functional units of analysis that reflect the spatial and temporal linkages of peatland elements through hydrological connections, rather than a focus on individual vegetation types and simple distance buffers. Our conclusions are not limited to peatland and are relevant wherever meaningful functional management units can be defined, including in marine environments.

(II) Marine ecological safety has not become the main concern of national security. Oil spills are disasters because humans spare no efforts to get economic benefits from oil. The present paper draws another conclusion that marine ecological damage caused by oil spills can be roughly divided into two categories: damage to marine resource value (direct value) and damage to marine ecosystem service value (indirect value). Marine oil spills cause damage to marine biological, fishery, seawater, tourism and mineral resources to various extents, which contributes to the lower quality and value of marine resources.",,,,,,,,,14,3,0,0,3,0,19,,,1672-5182,1993-5021,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China, Law and Polit Sch, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China",,,,2009-09-01,BCI:BCI200900488213,,

The associated emissions may partly counteract efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel infrastructure. We have developed an approach for assessing methane leakage from marine decommissioned wells based on a combination of existing regional industrial seismic and newly acquired hydroacoustic water column imaging data from the Central North Sea. Here, we present hydroacoustic data which show that 28 out of 43 investigated wells release gas from the seafloor into the water column. This gas release largely depends on the presence of shallow gas accumulations and their distance to the wells. The released gas is likely primarily biogenic methane from shallow sources. In the upper 1,000m below the seabed, gas migration is likely focused along drilling-induced fractures around the borehole or through non-sealing barriers. Combining available direct measurements for methane release from marine decommissioned wells with our leakage analysis suggests that gas release from investigated decommissioned hydrocarbon wells is a major source of methane in the North Sea (0.9-3.7 [95% confidence interval = 0.7-4.2] kt yr(-1) of CH4 for 1,792 wells in the UK sector of the Central North Sea). This means hydrocarbon gas emissions associated with marine hydrocarbon wells are not significant for the global greenhouse gas budget, but have to be considered when compiling regional methane budgets.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,1,0,32,,,1750-5836,1878-0148,,,,,,,,,,"GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, GermanyChristian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany",,,,2020-09-23,WOS:000567882900001,,

A Pb-210-dated sediment core, from the continental shelf of the Coatzacoalcos River, was studied to assess the contamination impact by the oil industry in the southern Gulf of Mexico. The sedimentary record showed the prevalence of petrogenic PAHs between 1950s and 1970s, a period during which waste discharges from the oil industry were not regulated. Later on, sediments exhibited higher contents of pyrogenic PAHs, attributed to the incineration of petrochemical industry wastes and recurrent wildfires in open dumpsites at the nearby swamps. The total concentration of the 16 EPA-priority PAHs indicated low levels of contamination (<100 ng g(-1)), except a peak value (>1000 ng g(-1)) during the late 1970s, most likely due to the major oil spill produced by the blowout of the Ixtoc-I offshore oil rig in deep waters of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Most of the PAH congeners did not show defined temporal trends but, according to a Factor Analysis, apparently have a common origin, probably waste released from the nearby oil industry. The only exceptions were the pyrogenic benzo(b)fluoranthene and benzo(a)pyrene, and the biogenic perylene, that showed increasing concentration trends with time, which we attributed to erosional input of contaminated soil from the catchment area.

To support the development of effective noise management policies, this paper explores the economic and policy context to noise abatement in three major noise-generating industries: shipping, offshore windfarm construction, and seismic surveying for oil and gas. In each case, tractable policy options are identified which make considered use of command-and-control and incentive-based measures in light of the available noise abatement methods.

Few studies have examined basin-scale variation in Hg accumulation in marine ecosystems, and determining if Hg concentrations in fish tissue vary across marine ecosystems is a key monitoring question. The present study evaluated Hg concentrations in red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) tissue across three regions of the northern Gulf of Mexico (Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas, USA) and between two habitat types (oil and gas platforms and nonplatforms) within each region. Nitrogen (d15N), carbon (d13C), and sulfur (d34S) stable isotopes were used to investigate ecological differences that may affect Hg concentrations among regions and between habitats. Mercury concentrations in red snapper tissue were positively correlated with fish total length. Regional differences in Hg concentrations were significant, with fish collected from Alabama having the highest concentrations and fish collected from Louisiana having the lowest. No significant difference existed in Hg concentrations between habitats, suggesting that association with platforms may not be a significant factor contributing to red snapper Hg concentrations. While d15N did not differ significantly among the three regions, Texas red snapper were more enriched in d34S and depleted in d13C compared with Alabama and Louisiana red snapper. Although the majority of red snapper collected in the present study had Hg concentrations below safe consumption guidelines, regional differences suggest that spatially explicit monitoring programs may be important for basin-wide assessments.

In Canada and theUS, the Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) supports lucrative fisheries, which were originally founded on an extensive scientific framework focusing on stock assessment. The sea scallop is an ideal sentinel species, as it is highly sensitive to changes in marine conditions. We used a drop camera system to estimate the number and size of scallops, as well as the distribution of their reproductive potential, over 70,000 km(2)of the continental shelf in 2016-2018, an area that nearly covers the entire range of this species. In total, we estimated that there were 34 billion individual scallops (95% confidence limits: 22-46 billion) within the species' range.

Identifying the organisms or functional groups that are responsible for nutrient transfer, and quantifying their influence on ecosystem structure and carbon capture is an essential step for informed management of ecosystems in physically distant, but ecologically linked areas. Here, we combine natural abundance stable isotope tracers and survey data to show that mid-water and bentho-pelagic-feeding demersal fishes play an important role in the ocean carbon cycle, bypassing the detrital particle flux and transferring carbon to deep long-term storage. Global peaks in biomass and diversity of fishes at mid-slope depths are explained by competitive release of the demersal fish predators of mid-water organisms, which in turn support benthic fish production. Over 50% of the biomass of the demersal fish community at depths between 500 and 1800 m is supported by biological rather than detrital nutrient flux processes, and we estimate that bentho-pelagic fishes from the UK-Irish continental slope capture and store a volume of carbon equivalent to over 1 million tonnes of CO2 every year.

AR-released fish were also identified more frequently across the entire array, with the majority (90%) of detections between receiver stations located within the AR system.

These unique hard banks, in most cases located in or adjacent to areas of intensive oil and gas production and transportation or in some cases near expanding areas of anthropogenic eutrophication, harbor diverse benthic assemblages including large numbers of undescribed species. The goal of this project, to be conducted by Drs. Fredericq and Felder at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in conjunction with a network of US and Mexican collaborators, is an intensive three year program to sample macroalgae and macrocrustaceans from 45-90 m depths on deep banks in the NE Gulf (vicinity of the Florida Middle Ground), SE Gulf (vicinity of the Dry Tortugas) and SW Gulf (off Yucatan, Mexico). Data from this project will be combined with information from available NW Gulf collections to establish comprehensive biodiversity inventories as well as descriptions of anticipated numerous new species, while increasing knowledge of endemism and distribution ranges of these dominant biotic assemblages. All seaweeds, as well as crabs, shrimp, lobsters, mantis shrimp, and related crustaceans will be identified using morphological and molecular evidence. The project produces a specimen database from new and existing collections that will be web-accessible and will include taxonomic, accession and life history data along with illustrations, photographs, checklists, new species descriptions, identification keys to problematic groups, sources of available DNA extracts and references to relevant DNA sequences. In the absence of documented diversity, and because most hard banks are afforded little attention in conservation and management plans that might otherwise protect them from negative impacts of oil and gas production or impacts from adjacent areas of regional anthropogenic eutrophication, the project provides resources essential to future research and educational training of students in taxonomy, phylogenetics, population genetics, ecology and conservation of the dominant groups in the Gulf of Mexico.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,315995,,,,,,,,University of Louisiana at Lafayette,University of Louisiana at Lafayette,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14034644,,

It has a complex topography and exposed nature, consisting of a mosaic of sandbanks and shallow channels amongst islands and rocky outcrops and as such gives rise to a range of biological communities which include maerl beds and coarse sands. Survey work is underway to improve knowledge of the habitats and species that occur in these sites. Survey work has also been undertaken to monitor the features of interest within these sites to allow for temporal analysis of the protected features. The aim of the current investigation was to improve knowledge of the current condition of the maerl and coarse sediment habitats on the eastern side of the Sound of Barra SAC. Surveys were carried out by SNH and Marine Scotland Science on board the MRV Alba na Mara during 18th-22nd April 2016. This work consisted of quantitative drop-down video surveys as well as the collection of 72 infaunal grab samples and granulometry samples for Particle Size Analysis (PSA). The Institute of Estuarine and Coastal Studies was commissioned to undertake the faunal analysis and PSA of the samples and produce a brief interpretative report to assign biotopes to all of the collected samples. Analysis of the associated video footage is reported separately (Moore, 2017). Main findings. Sediments collected within and in the vicinity of the Sound of Barra SAC were generally poorly sorted and made up of sandy-gravel and gravelly-sand, with the gravel and sand components accounting for >95 % of the sediment weight in most cases. The exception was survey box, S1, where the sediments had a mean mud content of 32 %, compared to < 9 % elsewhere. There was a gradual increase in mean particle size from S1 in the north to S6 in the middle, then size decreased again towards S9 in the south. Live maerl (Phymatolithon calcareum), a slow growing, coralline alga, was found in 45 out of 72 samples. Live encrusting coralline algae of the family Corallinaceae were also recorded across the site. A total of 588 taxa were identified in the grab samples. The total number of taxa per sample ranged from 22 taxa per 0.1 m2 at S9 to 138 taxa per 0.1 m2 at S6. Benthos abundance in the samples ranged between 65 individuals per 0.1 m2 to 498 individuals per 0.1 m2. An increasing pattern in the mean abundance was detected towards the centre of the SAC, with values peaking in S4, S5 and S6. Samples from S1 and S9 differentiated from the other areas mostly due to the absence of the maerl-forming species Phymatolithon calcareum and the absence or lower frequency of occurrence of several bryozoan species (e.g. Chorizopora brongniartii, Escharoides mamillata, Microporella ciliata and Aetea sica) which were common in the other areas.. Ten different biotopes or combinations of biotopes were identified across the the sampling area. The most common biotopes were SS.SCS.ICS.MoeVen, Mediomastus fragilis, Lumbrineris spp. and venerid bivalves in circalittoral coarse sand or gravel; SS. SCS. CCS. MedLumVen, Mediomastus fragilis, Lumbrineris spp. and venerid bivalves in circalittoral coarse sand or gravel; SS. SCS. CCS. Blan, Branchiostoma lanceolatum in circalittoral coarse sand with shell gravel; SS. SSa. CFiSa. ApriBatPo, Abra prismatica, Bathyporeia elegans and polychaetes in circalittoral fine sand and SS. SSa.

In addition P. calcareum was recorded in a number of samples, but not covered by the main biotope description. Note: assigning biotope combinations is not considered an appropriate method for habitat classification and primary biotopes assigned here will be used by SNH for further analysis and interpretation.

Until recently, fisheries managers and researchers have struggled to develop effective methods and data for social and economic analysis that can integrate with the predominantly biological approaches to fisheries management. The field is now growing fast, however, and globally, researchers are developing and testing new methods. This paper uses three divergent case studies to demonstrate the value of using qualitative social science approaches to complement more conventional quantitative methods to improve the knowledge base for fisheries management. In all three cases, qualitative interview and document review methods enabled broad surveying to explore the research questions in particular contexts and identified where quantitative tools could be most usefully applied. In the first case (the contribution of commercial fisheries to coastal communities in eastern Australia), a wellbeing analysis identified the social benefits from particular fisheries, which can be used to identify the social impacts of different fisheries management policies. In the second case (a gender analysis of fisheries of small islands in the Pacific), analysis outlined opportunities and constraints along fisheries supply chains, illuminated factors inhibiting community development and identified ecological factors that are typically overlooked in conventional fisheries management. In the third case (sea cucumber fisheries in Papua New Guinea), an interactive governance analysis assessed how well fisheries management tools fit the ecological, social and economic reality of the fishery and the trade in its products, including market influences and stakeholder values. The qualitative approach adopted in these three case studies adds a new dimension to understanding fisheries that is not possible with a focus solely on quantitative data. With the development of new policies on release programs (stock enhancement, restocking) and artificial reefs, and the momentum to use these interventions from recreational fishing groups, the qualitative approach will provide an important contribution to understanding their wider costs and benefits.

We examine two marine-based industries that incidentally take migratory birds in Canada: (1) commercial fisheries, through bycatch, and (2) offshore oil and gas exploration, development, and production. We summarize information from the scientific literature and technical reports and also present new information from recently analyzed data to assess the magnitude and scope of mortality. Fisheries bycatch was responsible for the highest levels of incidental take of migratory bird species; estimated combined take in the longline, gillnet, and bottom otter trawl fisheries within the Atlantic, including the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and Pacific regions was 2679 to 45,586 birds per year. For the offshore oil and gas sector, mortality estimates ranged from 188 to 4494 deaths per year due to the discharge of produced waters resulting in oil sheens and collisions with platforms and vessels; however these estimates for the oil and gas sector are based on many untested assumptions. In spite of the uncertainties, we feel levels of mortality from these two industries are unlikely to affect the marine bird community in Canada, but some effects on local populations from bycatch are likely. Further research and monitoring will be required to: (1) better estimate fisheries-related mortality for vulnerable species and populations that may be impacted by local fisheries, (2) determine the effects of oil sheens from produced waters, and attraction to platforms and associated mortality from collisions, sheens, and flaring, so that better estimates of mortality from the offshore oil and gas sector can be obtained, and (3) determine impacts associated with accidental spills, which are not included in our current assessment. With a better understanding of the direct mortality of marine birds from industry, appropriate mitigation and management actions can be implemented. Cooperation from industry for data collection, research to fill knowledge gaps, and implementation of mitigation approaches will all be needed to conserve marine birds in Canada.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cawthron Inst, Coastal & Freshwater Grp, Nelson, New Zealand",,,,2014-06-26,ZOOREC:ZOOR15007033963,,

Recent advances in structure-from-motion and photogrammetry have resulted in a proliferation of 3D digital representations of habitats from which structural complexity can be measured. Little attention has been paid to quantifying the measurement errors associated with these techniques, including the variability of results under different surveying and environmental conditions. Such errors have the potential to confound studies that compare habitat complexity over space and time. This study evaluated the accuracy, precision, and bias in measurements of marine habitat structural complexity derived from structure-from-motion and photogrammetric measurements using repeated surveys of artificial reefs (with known structure) as well as natural coral reefs. We quantified measurement errors as a function of survey image coverage, actual surface rugosity, and the morphological community composition of the habitat-forming organisms (reef corals). Our results indicated that measurements could be biased by up to 7.5% of the total observed ranges of structural complexity based on the environmental conditions present during any particular survey. Positive relationships were found between measurement errors and actual complexity, and the strength of these relationships was increased when coral morphology and abundance were also used as predictors. The numerous advantages of structure-from-motion and photogrammetry techniques for quantifying and investigating marine habitats will mean that they are likely to replace traditional measurement techniques (e.g., chain-and-tape). To this end, our results have important implications for data collection and the interpretation of measurements when examining changes in habitat complexity using structure-from-motion and photogrammetry.",,,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,29,0,56,,,2045-7758,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sydney, Australian Ctr Field Robot, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaUniv Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaMacquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW, AustraliaUniv Sydney, Sch Med & Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,,,2017-08-24,WOS:000407485300012,28808546,

Given the potential negative consequences of an oil spill on marine wildlife populations in the Arctic, it is important to understand the magnitude of impact a large spill could have on wildlife to inform response planning efforts. In this study we simulated oil spills that released 25,000 barrels of oil for 30 days in autumn originating from two sites in the Chukchi Sea (one in Russia and one in the U.S.) and tracked the distribution of oil for 76 days. We then determined the potential impact such a spill might have on polar bears (Ursus maritimus) and their habitat by overlapping spills with maps of polar bear habitat and movement trajectories. Only a small proportion (1-10%) of high-value polar bear sea ice habitat was directly affected by oil sufficient to impact bears. However, 27-38% of polar bears in the region were potentially exposed to oil. Oil consistently had the highest probability of reaching Wrangel and Herald islands, important areas of denning and summer terrestrial habitat. Oil did not reach polar bears until approximately 3 weeks after the spills. Our study found the potential for significant impacts to polar bears under a worst case discharge scenario, but suggests that there is a window of time where effective containment efforts could minimize exposure to bears. Our study provides a framework for wildlife managers and planners to assess the level of response that would be required to treat exposed wildlife and where spill response equipment might be best stationed. While the size of spill we simulated has a low probability of occurring, it provides an upper limit for planners to consider when crafting response plans.

Hydrocarbons from commercial oil and gas reserves escape into the sea bottom at natural seeps found commonly across the Gulf of Mexico's northern continental slope. Chemosynthetic animals utilize chemical energy from hydrocarbons to maintain colonies that have unusually high biomass compared with the sea bottom elsewhere. Chemosynthetic communities at hydrocarbon seeps were discovered in 1984 and have been previously investigated in studies funded by MMS. However, more knowledge was needed about the life history and ecology of chemosynthetic communities in the Gulf of Mexico.

However, our knowledge on post-dredging evolution of paleo-river channels is still very limited. In this study we focus on infilling rate, sediment acoustic characteristics, slope change and surficial morphology, all of which have implications for the management of seafloor oil and gas infrastructure. Bathymetric data collected during nine bathymetric surveys over 13 years were used to study the long-term changes of the Peveto Channel dredge pit, which is similar to 5 km offshore of Holly Beach in western Louisiana, USA. This pit was constructed in 2003 and was completely infilled in or before 2016. Initial pit infilling rates began at 214 cm/year from 2003 to 2004 and then rapidly decreased to an average rate of only 33 cm/year from 2006 to 2016. This corresponds volumetrically to 418,753 and 80,816 m(3)/year for the same intervals. Pit wall margins displayed small lateral migration, moving <30 m outwards over 13 years, posing minimal threat to adjacent infrastructure. After complete infilling, numerous small mounds were found on 2016 bathymetry, morphologically resembling 'mud volcanoes' that have been reported on deltas, continental shelves and slopes around the world. Newly deposited sediment on seafloor surface had a reflectivity lower than the ambient seafloor environment. Massive amounts of sediments were transported to the pit despite no proximity to direct riverine inputs, making the pit act as an efficient sediment trap. Inferred depth-integrated lateral sediment transport rates were 9.91-12.73 g/m/s. Despite the fact that Peveto Channel pit was filled up, consolidation continues and the filled sediment surface hasn't reach a condition in equilibrium with ambient seafloor yet. Our results highlight the continuing dewatering and long consolidation processes at the pit site even after a complete infilling. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of the present study was to assess the long-term impact of OA on a suite of physiological parameters of the sea urchin Echinometra mathaei in more realistic food conditions. A long-term experiment was conducted in mesocosms provided with an artificial reef in which the urchins principally fed on algae attached to the reef calcareous substrate. Contrasted pH conditions (pH 7.7 vs control) were established gradually over six months and then maintained for seven more months. Acid-base parameters of the coelomic fluid, growth and respiration rate were monitored throughout the experiment. Results indicate that E. mathaei should be able to regulate its extracellular pH at long-term, through bicarbonate compensation. We suggest that, within sea urchins species, the ability to accumulate bicarbonates is related to their phylogeny but also on the quantity and quality of available food. Growth, respiration rate and mechanical properties of the test were not affected. This ability to resist OA levels expected for 2100 at long-term could determine the future of coral reefs, particularly reefs where E. mathaei is the major bioeroder. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The Commission's decision was made after extensive review of alternative techniques for mitigating the impacts of the power plant, and recognizing that there is some uncertainty about the successful implementation of this requirement. Although techniques for preventing resource losses are generally preferred over techniques that provide replacement resources, such as the artificial reef, in this case the prevention techniques were ineffective, logistically infeasible, technically difficult, and/or very expensive; one technique, constructing cooling towers, would also have created other environmental and visual impacts. Of the various potential replacement techniques, only an artificial reef could replace the lost resources with the same type of resources. Data from artificial and natural reefs in Southern California indicate that the algal, invertebrate and fish communities are generally similar on artificial and natural reefs, so that a properly designed reef should be able to provide the types of resources impacted by the power plant. To insure that the mitigation reef successfully replaces the lost resources, the Coastal Commission established specific conditions that the reef must meet, required independent long-term monitoring to determine whether these standards are met, and required the power company undertake necessary remediation if the standards are not met.",,,,,,,,,47,1,0,0,25,0,49,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400037,,

A thick ice sheet covers 98% of the continent, the environment is harsh, and the movement of people and equipment is difficult and costly. Yet in recent decades the McMurdo Sound region has attracted intensive geological drilling because it is crucial for better understanding of past ice sheet behavior, including the evolution of both the East and West Antarctic Ice Sheets. Drilling started with the Dry Valley Drilling Project (DVDP) in 1973, resulting in 15 boreholes ranging in depth from 4 to 381 m. The last hole, DVDP-15, was drilled in 1975 from the local fast sea-ice covering McMurdo Sound. Since then, eight offshore sites (MSSTS, CIROS-2, CIROS-1, CRP-1, CRP-2/2A, CRP-3, AND-1B, AND-2A) have been cored, with much experience gained in both operational support and drilling procedures. Penetration depth has increased from 64.6 m (DVDP-15, 1975) to 1284.9 m (AND-1B, 2006) below the seafloor.

In the Gulf of Mexico, large colonies of the black coral Leiopathes glaberrima have been estimated to be over 2000 years old. As such, they are vulnerable to disturbance and slow to recover from adverse interactions with anchors, fishing gear, sedimentation, oil and gas extraction, and sampling. There is a growing need for non-lethal scientific collections and new information on the distribution, ecology, and population connectivity of L. glaberrima aggregations to support management decisions. A large number of remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys have been conducted in the Gulf of Mexico deep sea since 2008, including telepresence cruises that broadcast live seafloor images to shore. Visual observations from these surveys were collated and geo-referenced in a regional database with national museum records in order to: (1) map the distribution of L. glaberrima throughout the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, (2) predict the distribution of L. glaberrima based upon environmental correlates using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling, and (3) correlate the size-class structure to the age-class structure using growth rate estimates from previous radiocarbon studies. We found that L. glaberrima has a broad distribution in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, with suitable habitat spanning depths between 200 and 1000 m that are concentrated near the Mississippi Canyon and along the West Florida Shelf. On average, L. glaberrima colonies had a height of 34.2 cm and a basal diameter of 0.42 cm, which correlates to an age of similar to 143 yrs.

To better understand interactions between birds and human activities in the marine environment, telemetry is routinely used to characterize the area use of species, but evaluations are often based on a small number of individuals taken as representative of a local population studied. Furthermore, the relative importance of the number of animals required and for what duration they should be tracked has received little attention. We examined the central-place foraging movements of 24 lesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus) from a protected population from 1 March to 31 August during 2010-2013. Using bootstrapping and non-linear modeling, we investigated whether sample sizes were sufficient to characterize offshore area use by considering the cumulative area use for an increasing number of birds and duration of tracking. Box-and-whisker analysis suggested a minimum of 13 birds and a precautionary upper maximum of 41 birds were needed to describe 95% of the estimated area use of the population (defined by 100% occupancy). Tracking fewer birds for longer was more important than tracking more birds for less time. A period of 145 days was required to characterize area use for 13-41 birds; however, offshore areas were used primarily after May, meaning that a 97-day tracking period from May onwards was also representative. Predicted and observed areas were strongly correlated, and the predicted area of 15 birds for 151 days was 91% of the total estimated for the population. These findings suggest that the data were suitable for determining interaction with offshore developments, and were characteristic of the population. This study has revealed the power of a long-term tracking dataset, and has uncovered further complexities surrounding study design and analysis that may shape conclusions drawn. The method and considerations raised have wider applicability for other datasets where human-wildlife resource use conflicts need to be assessed.

The presence of benthic vegetation, such as seagrass, can attenuate wave and tidal energy, thereby altering suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) and microphytobenthos (MPB) biomass that secrete biogenic compounds that can increase sediment cohesion. The dual role of seagrass and MPB in altering the seasonal critical bed shear stress, tau(c), necessary to suspend sediment was studied within a Zostera marina seagrass meadow and an adjacent unvegetated region within a shallow coastal bay in Virginia, USA. Hydrodynamics and MPB biomass were recorded seasonally to determine the critical bed shear stress and subsequent SSC response. Results show that seagrasses reduced mean currents and waves, thus lowering SSC within the meadow. In addition, seagrass created favorable conditions for MPB growth, with annual mean sediment carbohydrate concentrations, a proxy for MPB activity, to be double within the seagrass compared to the unvegetated site. Sediment carbohydrate concentrations within the seagrass bed were higher during winter than summer due to enhanced light penetration, which coincided with an increase in tau(c) to 0.056 Pa compared to 0.024 Pa. tau(c) was found to be 0.021 Pa at the unvegetated site, with bed shear exceeding this threshold > 85% of the time.

They are located in the Atlantic and in the Eastern and Western Pacific oceans and in the Mediterranean Sea, in depths ranging between 400 and 6000 m in different geological contexts in passive and active margins. Our study is based on a review of the existent literature on 24 deep cold seeps. The geographic distribution of seeps, the variations of origin and composition of fluids, and rates of fluid flow are presented as they are important factors which explain the spatial heterogeneity and the biomass of biological communities. Methane-rich fluid of thermogenic and/or biogenic origin is the principal source of energy for high-productive communities; however, production of sulphide by sulphate reduction in the sediment also has a major role. The dominant seep species are large bivalves belonging to the families Vesicomyidae or Mytilidae. Other symbiont-containing species occur belonging to Solemyidae, Thyasiridae, Lucinidae bivalves, Pogonophora worms, Cladorhizidae and Hymedesmiidae sponges. Most of the symbiont-containing cold-seep species are new to science. Different symbiont-containing species rely on sulphide or methane oxidation, or both, via chemoautotrophic endosymbiotic bacteria. A total of 211 species, from which 64 are symbiont-containing species, have been inventoried. Patterns in biodiversity and biogeography are proposed. A large majority of the species are endemic to a seep area and the symbiont-containing species are mainly endemic to the cold-seep ecosystem. A comparison of species found in other deep chemosynthesis-based ecosystems, hydrothermal vents, whale carcass and shipwreck reduced habitats, reveals from the existing data, that only 13 species, of which five are symbiont-containing species occur, at both seeps and hydrothermal vents. The species richness of cold-seep communities decreases with depth. High diversity compared to that on hydrothermal vent sites is found at several seeps. This map be explained by the duration of fluid flow, the sediment substrate which may favour long-term conditions with accumulation of sulphide and the evolution of cold seeps.

The model study suggests that in Inner Silver Pit deposition of fine sediment is only possible under weak tidal (neap) flows. Under all other conditions the flow is too energetic to allow deposition. A transport path for fine sediment across Inner Silver Pit is established but does not significantly modify the sediment dynamics in the pit. Experiments including wave action show that 50-year return period waves induce bed shear velocities sufficiently large to remove coarse sediment. For Sole Pit a cycle of deposition followed by erosion at spring tides will inhibit deposition in the pit. Long term accretion of fine sediment does not seem possible in either pit.

There are well- developed tidal flats along the coast and around islands, together with offshore sand ridges several tens of kilometers long in the west. The effects of bottom boundary layer ( BBL) sediment stratification on sediment- transport and tidal dynamics in this environment were examined using a sediment transport model coupled with a three- dimensional tidal hydrodynamic model. Model experiments using two scenarios, with and without the effect of sediment- induced stratification, showed that BBL sediment- stratification influenced the spatial distribution and reduced the magnitude of net sedimentation. The presence of a sediment- stratified BBL also led to a reduction in suspended sediment fluxes and an increase in the vertical gradient of sediment concentrations in the water column. These variations occurred because sediment- induced BBL stratification leads to not only a reduction in bottom shear stress but also a decrease in buoyancy production of turbulent kinetic energy and an associated dampening of turbulence. The significant reductions in turbulence and bottom shear stress result in changes to the vertical- current structure of the M-2 tide, including alteration of the tidal ellipse configuration and an increase in vertical shears of the tidal current amplitude and phase. These reductions also lead to a slight increase in tidal amplitudes due to the decreased tidal- energy dissipation. The model results indicate that feedback between the sediment- transport dynamics and hydrodynamics is an important factor in modeling sediment transport dynamics in tidally dominated, turbid, coastal environments. Such environments include the west coast of Korea and the Yellow Sea. A suitable approach to simulating the effects of this feedback may be the use of a modified bottom- drag coefficient as a stability function, together with the inclusion of the effect of sediment stratification on the hydrodynamics.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,7,0,33,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New S Wales, Australian Def Force Acad, Sch Phys Environm & Math Sci, Canberra, ACT 2600, AustraliaJeollanamdo Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Resource Res, Sinangun, Jeonnam, South Korea",Jeollanamdo Fisheries Res Inst,,,2005-03-08,WOS:000227642100004,,

Planting, expanding or protecting seagrass meadows has, accordingly, been proposed as a form of geoengineering. Seagrasses are reported to account for up to 18% of the carbon burial in the world's oceans, which is on the same order of magnitude as other proposed geoengineering techniques, including iron fertilization. International protocols have been developed to quantify carbon sequestration in seagrass meadows, with a view to awarding carbon credits under the Verified Carbon Standard. Unfortunately, because these protocols do not adequately account for post-depositional processes in marine sediment, they significantly overestimate carbon capture by seagrass beds and give an incorrect view of its distribution. Specifically, neglecting biomixing and remineralization of carbon in surface sediments biases burial rates high, while using sediment carbon inventory (soil carbon stock) over the top 1 m as a proxy for burial rate incorrectly identifies areas of high carbon burial. Seagrass beds likely provide a limited setting for geoengineering, because they generally comprise slowly-accumulating, fine to medium sand, which captures organic carbon less efficiently than fine-grained sediments or rapidly-accumulating delta deposits. While there is no question that seagrass meadows provide valuable habitat, nor that they are disappearing rapidly, their contribution to the global burial of carbon has not yet been established. The danger of geoengineering with seagrasses before reliable assessment methods have been established is that overestimated carbon offsets could lead to a net increase in emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.",,,,,,,,,58,0,0,0,38,0,68,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Ocean Sci, 9860 W Saanich Rd,POB 6000, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada",,,,2016-11-01,WOS:000387357600001,,

PAHs in fish species found in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) were significantly higher than those from the Yachen (YC) gas fields (p < 0.05). Planktivorous fish exhibited significantly higher concentrations of PAHs than carnivorous and omnivorous fish (p < 0.05). The PAHs were dominated by three ring compounds. Source identification analyses indicated that the PAH pollution originated from petroleum inputs. The cancer and non cancer risk assessments concluded that the probable risk associated with the intake of PAHs via fish consumption is minimal. Long-term monitoring is necessary to determine the ecological impacts of PAHs associated with oil and gas activities.",,,,,,,,,65,3,0,0,54,0,68,,,0147-6513,1090-2414,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Fishery Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Fishery Ecol & Environm, Key Lab South China Sea Fishery Resources Exploit, Minist Agr,South China Sea Fisheries Res Inst, Guangzhou 510300, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaSouth China Inst Environm Sci, Minist Ecol & Environm, State Environm Protect Key Lab Environm Pollut Hl, Guangzhou 510655, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China Inst Environm Sci,,,2019-09-30,WOS:000473836100083,31152988,

The present situation is different, as the gravel and oyster habitats have (almost) disappeared due to bottom trawling activities. In addition to bottom trawling, the marine ecosystem of the Belgian part of the North Sea has been exposed to a multitude of pressures related to many human activities, which can be both located at sea (i.e. off shore wind farming) or find their origin on land (i.e. eutrophication). While legislation exists and measures are taken to protect the biodiversity and the functioning of the marine ecosystem, they regulate local activities but do not act on the exposure of the marine ecosystem to global changes (sea surface temperature warming, ocean acidification). Future initiatives to strengthen the impoverished communities in the Belgian part of the North Sea can include decreasing fishing pressure and the delineation of no-take zones.

Larvae are given a suite of idealized behaviors designed to reveal the importance of the surface boundary layer (SBL) to transport and settlement. Larvae remain near 5 m, 30 m, or transition between these depths using various strategies, including diel vertical migration (DVM) and ontogenetic vertical migration. Some behaviors result in modeled densities qualitatively similar to observed cross-shelf larval distributions. By remaining primarily below the SBL, larvae released from central California are 500 times more likely to be retained within 5 km of the coast at 30 days from release relative to those that stay near surface, and 145 times more likely to settle along the coast within a 30 to 60 day pelagic larval duration. For most behaviors, nearshore retention over time could be approximated as a modified exponential decay process. Vertical swimming also greatly affects alongshore dispersal, with each behavior resulting in a unique structure of alongshore settlement. Maintaining a depth near 30 m increases settlement throughout most of the CCS by at least an order of magnitude relative to passive larvae. Remaining near surface reduces settlement from Pt. Conception to Pt. Arena, but has less of an effect north of Cape Mendocino. Relative to passive larvae, DVM increases settlement in regional hotspots, but does not greatly alter overall recruitment in the CCS, and ontogenetic vertical migration increases settlement for central California regions south of Bodega Bay.",,,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,31,0,51,,,0022-2402,1543-9542,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ocean Sci Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USAUniv Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA USAUniv Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USAOregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,,,2013-07-01,WOS:000341707700003,,

The East Irish Sea Basin (EISB) is a prospective area for CCS in the western UKCS. 3D seismic from the EISB were used in this study to characterise the fault network and potential fault reactivation risks associated with CO2 injection. Two main structural domains are present: a Northern domain with NW-SE faults, and a Southern domain with faults following a N-S orientation. The main storage sites consist of structural closures in Triassic strata of the Sherwood Sandstone Formation (SSF), overlain by alternations of mudstones and evaporites of the Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group (MMG). The closures occur predominantly at fault-bounded horsts, with adjacent grabens filled by thick sequences of the Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group (MMG). The fault framework was used to test, in 3D, the stress model published for the EISB and assess the fault reactivation risk associated with CO2 storage. Slip tendency values were pre-dominantly below 0.6, suggesting the presence of stable structures in the EISB. Under the tested conditions, faults are capable of withstanding pressure increases between 3 MPa and 10 MPa before the onset of slip. The limited fault reactivation risk suggests CCS operations are suitable prospects for the EISB.

Light traps and passively-fished plankton nets were used nocturnally between 1995-2000 to collect fishes in surface and deep (15-23 in depth) waters within the platform structure, and light traps were also used in surface waters directly down-current of the platforms. Light traps fished at the surface, as opposed to at-depth, collected greater CPUEs and greater diversity of larval and juvenile fishes. Of the dominant taxa collected by light traps, clupeids, engraulids, synodonfids, and presettlement blenniids were most common in surface waters within the platform, while postflexion sconibrids and settlement-size blenniids and pomacentrids were most common in surface waters down-current of the platforms. Deep plankton nets collected greater densities of non-clupeiform larval fishes, although surface plankton nets collected greater numbers of taxa. The vertical distribution patterns described for dominant larval fish collected by plankton nets were generally consistent with those from other studies, i.e. clupeid, carangid, sciaenid and scombrid larvae more abundant in surface waters at platforms, and synodontid, bregmacerotid, gobiid and bothid larvae more abundant in deeper waters. Oil and gas platforms likely impact larval and juvenile fish populations, particularly considering their proliferation in the Gulf (i.e., over 4000 platforms).

There is particular concern over the extension of these activities into previously undeveloped areas of the oceans, including Polar Regions and areas of coral reef habitat. Most of the concern by regulators and others has focussed upon effects upon marine mammals and other protected species. However, examining the impacts upon the overall ecology of affected habitats is also important as it may be dominated by effects upon the far larger biomasses of fishes and invertebrates, which do not have the same degree of legal protection. Many of these assessments of the impact of noise on fishes and invertebrates have overlooked important issues, including the sensitivity of a substantial proportion of these species to particle motion rather than sound pressure. Attempts have been made to establish sound exposure criteria setting regulatory limits to the levels of noise in terms of effects upon mortality levels, injury to tissues, hearing abilities, behaviour, and physiology. However, such criteria have almost exclusively been developed for marine mammals. Criteria for fishes and invertebrates have often had to be assumed, or they have been derived from poorly designed and controlled studies. Moreover, the metrics employed to describe sounds from different sources have often been inappropriate, especially for fishes, and invertebrates, as they have been based on sound pressure rather than particle motion. In addition, the sound propagation models employed to assess the distances over which effects might occur have seldom been validated by actual measurements and are especially poor at dealing with transmission under shallow water conditions, close to or within the seabed, or at the surface. Finally, impacts on fish and invertebrate populations are often unknown and remain unassessed. This paper considers the problems of assessing the impact of noise upon fishes and invertebrates and the assessment procedures that need to be implemented to protect these animals and the marine ecosystems of which they form an integral part. The paper also suggests directions for future research and planning that, if implemented, will provide for a far better scientific and regulatory basis for dealing with effects of noise on aquatic life.",,,,,,,,,123,1,0,0,88,0,132,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"Aquat Noise Trust, Aberdeen AB12 5YT, ScotlandUniv Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Aquat Noise Trust,,,2017-04-14,WOS:000398662100003,,

Their disproportionate contribution to carbon sequestration is now perceived as a means for conservation and restoration and a way to help ameliorate greenhouse gas emissions. Of immediate concern are potential carbon losses to deforestation (90-970 Tg C y(-1)) that are greater than these ecosystems' rates of carbon storage.

Sediment dry bulk density, mean grain size, sorting coefficient, % mud, elevation above sea level, and pore water salinity showed high levels of association with C-stocks when assessed individually. Multivariate analyses showed that sediment dry bulk density, sorting coefficient, % mud, and pore water pH and concentration of nutrients greatly influenced C-stock.

It triggered massive tsunamis which caused extensive devastation on land and unprecedented loss of lives, and will go down as one of the worst human tragedies in history. Four out of the 10 Southeast Asian countries were affected by the December 26, 2004 earthquake and tsunami - Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Myanmar, all with coastlines lying within the Indian Ocean. Indonesia The northern sections of the island of Sumatra suffered the most severe damage. Pre and post-tsunami satellite images of northern Sumatra show considerable changes to the coastline morphology, including changes to the bathymetry of the surrounding waters. The tsunamis infiltrated several kilometers in to mainland in many areas, destroying not just coastal areas but entire cities and villages. An early estimate of coral reef damage falls in the range of 30%. Thailand A total of six provinces were affected by the tsunami [long dash] Phuket, Ranong, Phang-Nga, Krabi, Trang and Satun, with Phang-Nga experiencing the greatest impact. A total of 174 sites covering the six affected provinces were assessed. 12% of the sites showed severe impact; with 47% of the sites showing low to moderate impact and 41% of the sites had no visible impact from the tsunami. Malaysia The tsunamis reached the northwestern coast of Malaysia 2-3 hours following the earthquake. Coral reefs along the northwestern region of Malaysia were assessed in March 2005, and no tsunami related damage was observed at all sites surveyed, including Pulau Langkawi, Pulau Paya and Pulau Perek. Myanmar Official government reports that followed stated that Myanmar was only mildly affected by the tsunami, and subsequent assessments by NGOs and unofficial reports by tour operators and tourists substantiated the government reports. An assessment of the coral reefs of western Mergui Archipelago by Reef Check Europe and WorldFish Center in March 2005 indicated that the reefs were literally untouched by the tsunami waves with little environmental damage. CURRENT STATUS OF CORAL REEFS Cambodia Coral reefs are distributed along the offshore islands and rocky coastlines of Cambodia, covering a total reef area of approximately 28.065 km2. Seven sites have been identified and established for long term monitoring. Diversity studies have indicated that 111 species of hard coral, 17 species of soft corals and 9 species of seafans and seawhips are present in Cambodian waters. The average live coral cover at the seven monitoring sites range from 23% to 58%. Indonesia Indonesia is a large archipelagic nation with about 14% of the world's coral reef area. Results form coral monitoring activities between 1993 to 2003 showed an overall improvement in coral reefs in poor condition, while reefs in the good and excellent condition remained relatively stable and unchanged. However, progressive degradation of coral reefs within the last 10-15 years in several areas has been recognized. The best reefs were mostly restricted to remote areas or areas with some level of active management in place. Philippines Changes in the percent cover of different benthic lifeform categories on coral reefs in the Philippines that are in excellent condition indicate that the reefs may be experiencing a steady state of decline (from 5% to 3% to >1% of reefs in excellent condition). However, reefs in good condition are still present in the Celebes Sea, Southern Philippine Sea, Sulu Sea and the Visayas biogeographic regions. About 15% of the reefs surveyed in South China Sea and Sulu Sea sustained very high fish biomass. Singapore Singapore is a small island state with an estimated 54km2 of coral reefs. Almost the entire coastline of the main island, particularly the southern half have been altered by land reclamation and many of the southern offshore islands merged by reclamation to form larger islands. Coral reefs, once abundant along the southwest coastline of the main island have been lost to coastal reclamation and are now restricted to narrow fringing bands and patches among the southern offshore islands. Despite the limited reef area and high anthropogenic impacts, some reefs still support good coral cover (50% - 70% coral cover) and diversity (over 150 species of corals). Thailand The coastal areas of Thailand between latitudes 6[degree] and 13[degree]N offer suitable environmental conditions for coral reef development. Three types of coral distribution are recognized in Thailand - coral communities with no true reef structure; developing fringing reefs; and early formation of fringing reefs. The surveys of coral reefs in certain provinces during 2002-2004 showed obvious changes condition of some reefs within the Gulf of Thailand, while the condition of coral reefs in the Andaman Sea have remained relatively unchanged. Vietnam Coral reefs are distributed within the shallow waters of the main coastline and around the offshore islands. Coral reefs in better condition are found within the central coastal areas and around the southeastern islands, where temperatures are normally greater than 20[degree]C, and where the reefs experience some offshore influences. Recent coral survey data indicate a dominance of reefs with fair to poor condition (18% and 30% hard coral cover respectively at 50 monitoring sites). Declining abundance of key invertebrate and fish indicators also indicate a reduction of economically important reef organisms. Reefs in better condition were only recorded at some reefs in Ninh Thuan and Phu Quoc. China The lack of warm water along much of China's coast has inhibited coral reef growth. Typical fringing reefs occur mainly on part of coasts of Hainan Island and Taiwan Island. Before 1984, coral reefs in China were in good condition with more than 70% in coral cover. In the 1990s, coral reef conditions declined occurred in great pace due to the fast social-economic growth. Coral percent cover was 32% in Daya Bay in 1991 and 38% in Luhuitou, Sanya, in 1994. During the recent surveys in 2002 in China, coral percent cover was still low as 35% in Daya Bay and 19% in Luhuitou. However, some areas have higher coral percent cover such as 68% in Yongxing Island, Xisha Island. Hong Kong Coral Communities are mainly found in the eastern and northeastern coasts of Hong Kong. There are currently four marine parks and one marine reserve in Hong Kong and all the MPAs are now being monitored for various physical parameters and biodiversity and abundance of corals, fish, other invertebrates and algae. The corals within the marine parks in the northeast are so far, generally healthy and some increase in coral cover has been registered over the last four years. Taiwan Coral reefs are found in all the waters around Taiwan except in the sandy area on the west coast. No significant changes in coral cover among years were found between 1997 and 2004, because both increasing and decreasing trends were observed. However, more increasing trends at reef slope and more decreasing trends at reef flat were found, suggesting that the reef flat biota was more frequently influenced by anthropogenic disturbances than that of the reef slope. Japan Corals widely distribute from Ryukyu Islands to northern islands of Japan including Kyushu, Shikoku and Honshu. Although most of the coral have been recovered gradually in 10 to 20 years after the outbreak of crown of thorns starfish (COTs), the number of COTs has been increasing again in 2000's. After the catastrophic bleaching event in 1998, relatively small scale bleaching occurred in 2001, 2002 and 2003. On the other hand, coral coverage is increasing in the northern islands because of elevated water temperature in winter relaxing the limits for coral growth in the area. Korea Korean waters do not have any typical coral reefs by reef building corals, because of the low water temperature. Only the area around Jeju Island affects the influence of warm current and has temperate, subtropical and tropical marine species. 134 of soft and hard coral species are found in Korea including 15 species of stony corals. Most of researches have been conducted on soft corals mainly in Jeju Island THREATS TO CORAL REEFS Cambodia There are many anthropogenic impacts to coral reefs including destructive fishing practices, over-fishing, coastal development, agricultural run-off, sedimentation and seaweed farming on reefs. Reef fish and invertebrates densities are low due to over-fishing. Indonesia Many coastlines are being rapidly degraded mainly through inappropriate land development. Rapid population growth, land-based industry, domestic waste and tourism have resulted in a wide range of environment and resource management problems. The marine resources are severally threatened by destructive fishing methods such as dynamite, cyanide, compressors, fish traps, reef gleaning and over fishing. Philippines Philippines has a large coastal population that is highly dependent on reef resources for their livelihoods. Over-fishing and destructive fishing practices are by far the greatest threats to the reefs, followed by coastal development and land-based activities. Singapore Ongoing land reclamation since the early 1970's has resulted in elevated sedimentation. Regular dredging of shipping lanes and the offshore dumping of dredged spoils contribute to the sediment load. This chronic impact has resulted in the decline in reef condition since 1986, with a marked reduction in the vertical growth zone along the reef slopes. Thailand The first tsunami disaster in the history of Thailand occurred on December 26, 2004. 13% of the reef monitored showed high impact, with around 40% showing no impact. 21%, 17% and 9% of the reefs showed very low, low and moderate impact respectively. Vietnam There were serious outbreaks of the Crown-of-Thorns starfish in Van Phong and Nha Trang bays, while algal bloom killed almost all the coral reefs in Ca Na bay (Binh Thuan province), with the recovery occurring slowly after the event. Sedimentation continues to have a strong impact in Ha Long and Cat Ba islands. China Overfishing and destructive fishing practices have badly damaged coral communities around Hong Kong and Xisha islands, causing most high-value fish species to become locally extinct. Blast fishing has been widely practiced in Hainan Island. Cyanide fishing is carried out by large-scale commercial operators who take fish from remote areas such as Xisha Island and Nansha Island. Cyanides are also used for collecting aquarium fishes. Sedimentation, freshwater incursion, and sewage outflows have adversely impacted China's reefs, particularly near the mainland. Failure in proper managing the land resources have caused problems of siltation. Local governments has bombed out Mabian Zhou, Daya Bay for oil industry in late 1990s, although coral reef transplantation has been carried out to reduce the reef destruction, the damage to coral reefs is still great. Hong Kong Occasional bleaching, predation, human or storm disturbances have been observed in Hong Kong waters. High sedimentation due to dredging and land reclamation, high nutrients due to effluence of untreated sewage and high heavy metal contents due to industrial effluence are some of the main marine pollution problems in Hong Kong. Extensive mortality of corals was reported in South Ninepin attributable to heavy siltation brought about by dredging in Tung Long Wan Borrow area. Hong Kong waters are generally considered as being overfished. Taiwan Soil erosion and landslides frequently occur in coastal areas especially after storms, and these runoffs have carried large amounts of sediment and nutrients to reef areas. Sewage of most towns and villages in coastal areas are often ill-treated and discharged to reef areas. This induces serious nutrient enrichment to reef ecosystems especially in northeastern and southern Taiwan, and Hsiaoliuchiu. Although blast and poison fishing methods have been officially banned, there are still sporadic reports on these illegal fishing methods. Anchor damages could be found sporadically on most reefs. Bottom-trawlers, with their heavy gears sweep over reef surface, have caused severe damage to coral reefs in Penghu Islands. Trampling and mechanical breakage of coral skeleton by divers and tourists have been a serious problem at diving hotspots in Lutao, Penghu, and southern Taiwan. Construction of fishing ports and coastal highway in northeastern and eastern Taiwan has caused damage to coral reefs. Extensive coral bleaching was observed in southern Taiwan, Penghu Is., and Hsiaoliuchiu reefs following heavy rainfalls associated with typhoons in June and July, 2004. Outbreak of a sea anemone, Condylactis nanwanensis, was noticed in Nanwan Bay, southern Taiwan and caused severe damage to coral reefs since it destroys coral tissue and weakens coral skeleton. Typhoon is another disturbance on corals in Taiwan. Coral communities at Chitou, Penghu Islands and Tiaoshi, Nanwan Bay were heavily damaged (up to 90% coral mortality) by Typhoon in 2001, and have not recovered since then. Japan The number of COTs has been increasing again in southern part of Japan since 2000's. After the catastrophic bleaching event in 1998, relatively small scale bleaching occurred in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Soil runoff by the coastal development is also one of the major threats on the reefs in Okinawa and mainland Japan. The corallivorous gastropod, Drupella is still major predator of corals in northern islands. Korea The increase of tourists for SCUBA diving and tourist submarine have become the cause of reef destruction. CORAL REEF MANAGEMENT Cambodia The Cambodian government has very limited human resources, infrastructures, and finances for scientific research and monitoring. There are no laws that relate to the protection of coral reefs, with the exception of a Fisheries law. A national action plan that integrates coral reef management and conservation, capacity building and maintenance, infrastructure and institutional development, improved legislations, better administrative framework and enforcement, public awareness, communication, education, and participation, biodiversity assessments and regular monitoring is urgently needed. Indonesia The new 1999 legislation (Autonomy laws No. 22/1999 and No. 25/1999) effectively integrated all previous legislations concerning marine management. The ministry of Forestry's Directorate General for Protection and Nature Conservation (PKA) is the agency responsible for nature conservation in Indonesia. The government has set a target to establish 10 million ha of marine conservation area; however, only some 5.8 million ha has been officially declared, which includes 37 marine conservation area. Coral reef ehabilitation and Management Program (COREMAP) have conducted public communication programs for the last two years. All target sites were positively affected by the campaign. Philippines The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and the Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DA-BFAR) are the two national government agencies that have the mandate to establish MPAs or fishery refuges. Under the 1998 Philippine Fisheries Code, at least 15% of the total coastal areas in each municipality should be identified as fish sanctuaries. Of over 600 MPAs that have been established in the Philippines, only around 10% of these MPAs are actually being managed effectively. A National Coral Reef Strategy is currently being prepared to provide a clear and integrated management framework for the protection, conservation and rehabilitation of the coral reefs in the country. Singapore There are no marine protected areas covering coral reefs, although proposals to protect identified reefs have been made. Currently, only two legislated nature areas have marine components, but they do not contain reefs. The establishment of the Biodiversity Center within the National Parks Board in 2004 has increased the focus on the marine environment. Artificial reefs and coral translocation activities have been initiated since the mid-1990's to address the issue of coral reef remediaion. Thailand There are numerous institutions involved in coral reef monitoring and management, coordinated through the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources and several universities. A National Coral Reef Strategy: Policies and Action Plan was adopted by the cabinet in 1992. All the major coral reefs in Thailand are assigned to one of four management categories - general use zones, intensive tourism zones, ecotourism zones and ecosystem reserve zones. The majority of coral reefs are classified as ecotourism zones. There have been a few studies on community-based management of coral reefs in Thailand, such as Had Chaolao in Chantaburi Province where local people manage coral reefs for tourism. Vietnam National government and international agencies have supported the development of a network of marine protected areas in Vietnam. A national action plan for coral reef management is being developed under the framework of UNEP GEF/SCS project. China Coral reefs are protected and managed by the regulations, such as; the State Law of Marine Environment Protection issued in 1983 and new revised edition issued in 2000; the Hainan Province Regulation of Coral Reef Protection issued in 1998; and the State Law of Ocean Use Management issued in 2001 demand that all coastal development programs need accord with the Division of Marine Functional Zonation made by government. There are 3 Marine Coral Reefs Reserves in mainland of China and more MPAs are in the planning process. Marine Coral Reefs Reserves are no-take areas where only scientific research is allowed within the boundaries. A program named Restoration of Coral Reef Ecosystem and Protection and Management of Its Biodiversity in South China Sea of China is one of the priority programs of 21 Century Ocean Agenda of China. Hong Kong The most important legislature that has a direct bearing on the protection of coral communities is the Marine Parks Ordinance that enacted in 1995 and took effect in July 1996. This Ordinance provides for the designation, control and management of marine parks and marine reserves under the Country and Marine Parks Authority of the Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD). The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD, former AFD) of the Hong Kong SAR Government is the lead agency overseeing the protection of Hong Kong marine parks. The Authority is advised by the Country and Marine Parks Board that is made up of representatives from different government departments, the academia, NGOs and the public. There are currently four Marine Parks and one Marine Reserve in Hong Kong. AFCD provides the funding for research teams from tertiary institutions to monitor the parks. Taiwan Most coral reefs in Taiwan are within national parks, national scenic areas or coastal conservation zones and these areas are protected by the National Park Law and the Coastal Environmental Protection Plan. However, the current laws are inadequate to protect coral reefs. The revision of laws and the planning of MPAs with effective management are currently processing by governmental administrations. Japan There are several management practices conducted in the local communities to control the disturbances, such as COTs and Drupella. The government has established the Law for the Promotion of Nature Restoration and focus on integrated coastal management involving different stakeholders for coral conservation. There are two programs of Nature Restoration Projects targeting coral conservation. Korea Southern coast of Jeju-do were designated as MPA in the name of Wetland Protection Areas by Ministry of Maritime Affaires and Fisheries (MOMAF) as well as Man and Biosphere (MAB) by UNESCO in 2002. There are some overlapping between designation of protected area and development plan in different level (agencies) and they made local stakeholders confused.

Such dramatic environmental changes will have strongly affected the ecosystem in the Gulf of Corinth, and with it the cycling of bioessential elements like carbon and phosphorus. In similar situations where a lake was flooded and gradually salinified by the incursion of seawater, like in the Black Sea or Baltic Sea at the end of the last ice age, very distinct geochemical regimes developed in the water column that had strong impacts on the chemistry of the water column: A stable stratification developed between fresh lake waters on top and saline seawater below, and this restricted mixing of the water column. As a result, the deep waters became completely free of oxygen, and thus inhospitable to multi-cellular life - even poisonous due to the production of hydrogen sulphide. It is currently unknown if the Gulf of Corinth experienced similarly dramatic environmental changes and the development of an oxygen-free deep water mass. If so, this would have had important implications for the preservation of organic carbon in the sediments - the raw material for our modern oil and gas resources - as organic matter is much less degraded under oxygen-depriven conditions.

In such relatively high latitude area, sea surface temperature (SST) is an important factor affecting the development of coral reef ecosystem. Measurements of the latest 42 years' SST of Weizhou Island showed that with 3 apprx 4 years and 7 apprx 8 years fluctuating cycles, the SST almost had a synchronous increase with global warming, especially since the later 1980s. Overall, the coral reef of Weizhou Island could benefit from the SST warming, especially the cold months SST increase, because it's the north margin of tropical zone. But, the warming of the warmest month may be a thermal stress on the development of coral reef. It reaches the upper limits of coral reef development, and leads the coral reef bleaching. Mankind activities, including wide scale building, oil gas factory near the island, traveling, fishing and breeding, may be also the potential stresses on limiting the coral reef development.

Populations fluctuate following severe or mild weather conditions, disappearing after harsh winters and coming back more rapidly then in the past. Some offshore species are stranded or wrecked more often. Species new to the area, including aliens, turn up and establish. These observations are believed to be mainly triggered by changes in the oceanographic/climatic conditions, luring or forcing southern species into the southern North Sea and the coastal waters. The marine fauna and flora of the English Channel is acting as a waiting or retreating room, from which establishment or rapid recovery can take place.

J,,,,,,,,,David Bailey,,Sundarbans fisheries: a model system for the application of landscape ecology and social science approaches to management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Dec 01 2018,2018,"Coastal ecosystems provide important services to human communities, the most well-known being food provision from fishing. Fisheries are critically important, providing food security and income to communities worldwide. However, the removal of marine species and damage to marine habitats from fishing activity may affect other services, like coastal protection and carbon capture. Other industries that depend on healthy marine ecosystems and biodiversity, such as tourism, may also be affected. Fishing activity can also damage resources on which targeted fish species depend, including important nursery areas for young fish.In response to declines in fish numbers and environmental damage many countries have signed international agreements to use an ecosystem approach to fisheries. An ecosystem approach links fish and their environment. To do this we need to understand what aspects of the marine environment are important to fish. A typical method has been to identify essential fish habitat - the type of seabed which seems to be most important to the fish in question. This method identifies one essential fish habitat and differs from best practice on land, where we have long recognised that species use different habitats through their lives. On land, we understand that different habitats need to be linked so that animals can move between them. This landscape ecology approach is not applied to fisheries management, as we lack sufficient information about spatial distribution of different seabed types and biodiversity patterns across underwater landscapes.Using underwater camera systems and seabed maps we have previously demonstrated that fish in a UK marine protected area are affected by the seabed type and biodiversity in their immediate area, and also by the wider landscape. Using underwater landscape information has huge potential to improve management of fisheries in the developed and developing world. But we need sufficient information about the different habitat types, biodiversity patterns and how fish are affected by them.This presents a paradox. How can we test and develop ideas of huge scientific and practical value about fish landscape ecology without incurring the great expense associated with biodiversity and environmental mapping? How can we persuade others to pay for the necessary mapping without more evidence of the usefulness of marine landscape approaches?Fortunately, a suitable landscape exists in the Sundarbans Mangrove forest (SMF). The project partner, Sarker, has carried out a mapping and modelling project which has resulted in a comprehensive map of the physical and biological characteristics of the SMF. The waters in this forest are rich fishing grounds, providing food and livelihoods to millions. However, fisheries in the SMF are in trouble and lack any effective management.We will sample fish throughout the SMF to understand what aspects of the SMF environment are associated with increased abundance, diversity and size of fish. We will investigate how fish are affected by their immediate environment and also how they are affected by the landscape around them (whether it is a patchwork of different habitats, or a uniform environment consisting of one habitat type).We will also interview fishers to understand how they choose where to fish, and whether they use the same types of signs that we detect from our sampling. In particular, we want to know whether fishers consider the wider landscape around their fishing locations, or just the immediate environment. These questions are important as we need to know how to choose management measures which do not hinder fishers, while ensuring that fish and their essential habitat is protected.This short project will greatly develop fish landscape ecology, applicable to fisheries worldwide. The work will inform the management of the SMF fisheries so that they can provide sustainable food supplies and livelihoods.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/S008233/1,,,,,,,,University of Glasgow,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15310435,,

To the North and South of Mar del Plata City, extense dune fields conform the Eastern and Southern barriers. These dune fields are very modern, since they have been formed as consequence of a Holocene sea-level fluctuation (Schnack et al., 1982; Violante and Parker 1993; Isla, 1997). The objective of the study was to analyse the natural and artificial morphological changes of the beaches of Pinamar, Villa Gesell, Mar Chiquita, General Pueyrredón, General Alvarado, Lobería and Necochea counties, and the description and discussion of results obtained from 1983 to 2004. Special emphasis was made to the sedimentary dynamics of these beaches and the changes induced by man-made structures (groynes fields) and sand mining. The beaches have different orientation, dynamics, grain size, as well as different human alteration degree. The work was based on the comparison of beach profiles according to conventional methods (Fox and Davis, 1978; Isla, 1992; Isla et al., 1994; Bértola, 2001), the evaluation of the morphological classification based on Dean's number (Dean, 1973), Omega parameter (Masselink and Short, 1993), Battje´s number (Short, 1996), and the parameter of Guza and Inman (1975). Surface grain sizes were analysed using the parameters of Folk and Ward (1957) and evaluating beach slope changes. North Area Morphology: These are oceanic beaches, with average width of 72 m., The berm remains stabilised or it is in setback. Berm width increases at the touristic area in Mar de las Pampas. Villa Gesell beaches (Spa Los Históricos) suffered significant variations. In the pristine areas, there is presence of dunes after the backshore, although many of them are forested. Balance: In this area, there are no structures or estuaries that could affect the littoral drift. The Pinamar-Cariló sector has recorded an important accumulation (27,580 m³) diminishing toward the North of the urban area. The beach of Villa Gesell has also registered accumulation (18,200 m³), except in certain areas of the centre of the urban area, where erosion existed. Toward the South of Mar de las Pampas, the trend is depositional again. Grain sizes: The sediments of the backshore have increased their size up to 1994 and begin stable since 2000. In the foreshore, the mean (phi) has a reduction tendency. It diminished from 1994 to 1996 where it stops then increases very slowly. In some samples of Mar de las Pampas and Mar Azul, bioclastic composition dominates that would indicate a source of contribution from the South that coincides with old places of extraction of sands for construction. In addition, to the South of Villa Gesell, the erosion of dunes exhumes old beach crests or non-operative overwash composed by sand with shells and gravels (Isla, 1998). Slopes: Slope increases from South to North, with anomalous values in the centre of Pinamar. Temporarily, the general slopes increase their value in the time since 1998. Central Area Morphology: General Pueyrredón beaches change from North to South in: a) beaches among closed groynes, b) artificially refilled beaches, c) oceanic open beaches, and d) beaches at the foot of cliffs; in Miramar there are also beaches among groynes, but these with more spacing to each other (e). Beaches between groynes characterise La Perla area, with average widths of 64 m. Beach fills were conducted from Playa Popular to Playa Grande, their widths are of 107 m. The oceanic beaches extending from Mar del Plata Harbour to the Punta Mogotes Lighthouse and have 102 m. Beaches at the foot of cliffs (Costa Hermosa to Los Acantilados) are narrow, about 60 m. Those beaches between groynes from Chapadmalal to Miramar are 75 m. The beaches oriented to the Southeast have higher dynamics (Alfar, Chapadmalal and Miramar) with volumetric variations of the order of several thousands of cubic meters. Some have antrophic action that modifies totally and in a few days their morphology, for what we should absorb of the seasonal effects of erosion in winter and accumulation in the analysis of the results in spring. To the end of winter, beaches recover. Balance: The beaches of General Pueyrredón and Miramar are mixed and complex. There are pocket beaches, and beaches with abrasion plains; there is an important component of constructions of coastal defences. Mar del Plata beaches recorded an erosive trend (-2.266 m³) excluding the refilled volumes of 1998. This demonstrates the natural eroded tendency in the beaches without artificial feeding. Toward the North of the urban area of Mar del Plata there is accumulation, in their Central section there is erosion and toward the South of the urbanisation (Punta Mogotes Lighthouse) there is accumulation again. To the South -cliff areas-, erosion dominates. As expected, the highest variability was recorded at the refilled beaches, but there are significant dynamics at other of them (Acevedo, Spa Camping El Faro and Los Acantilados). General Alvarado beaches registered an important accumulation of 28.000 m³ of sand, of which 20% belongs to the urban coastline of Miramar (Spa HR). Grain sizes: In these beaches, the sediments have gone increasing the mean from 1998. The beaches increased the size of their sands toward the North, with fine grains in the refilled beaches and for the effect of tombolo in Los Pinos Beach (Alfar). In some samples of Chapadmalal, coarse grains of basaltic and andesitic composition have been detected in the bottom of the backshore, and pebbles of loess in the top of the backshore. This would indicate a particular dynamics that accumulates rolling stones transported by coastal drift from the South, the first one presumably of patagonic pebbles and of eroded material of the cliff bordering, in the second. Slopes: Beach slopes decrease from North to South, with abrupt peaks in the centre of the urban areas of Mar del Plata. The extreme values in the slopes were observed in the resort places from the downtown. Temporarily, the variations in the slopes were very important; in general a tendency was appreciated to increase the slope of the general beach along the time (except in beaches like Alfonsina, Las Dunas and Los Acantilados). South Area Morphology: The beaches of this area are open and with Loess cliffs. From Miramar to Mar del Sur beach widths extend to 79 m, and from Mar del Sur to Necochea they are narrower (68 m). Touristic activities diminish southwards. The beaches with more dynamics are those that possess groynes, cliffs and abrasion plains, as long as the beach open of Cruz del Moro has had smaller volumetric variations. Some beaches have suffered antrophic action (Costa Bonita or Cruz del Moro) that modified their morphology. Balance: They are heterogeneous beaches, with cliffs and engineering works in Mar del Sur and Costa Bonita, and open beaches in Cruz del Moro and Arenas Verdes. It begins to be important the action of the streams that in certain cases obstruct the longshore drift or they are plugged by effect of the same one. In General Alvarado accumulation is appreciated toward the North and South of the urban area of Miramar, with an important accumulation in Mar del Sur. Lobería presents erosion in its entire coast (-14.746 m³) with more loss in its Eastern sector. Costa Bonita beaches have more dynamics and Cruz del Moro suffer less variability. In both municipalities, erosion cycles and accumulation were observed along the year in correspondence to seasonal variations. Grain sizes: In the beaches of this area, an increase of the value of the mean is appreciated from 1995. In the backshore, grain size diminishes toward the South and in the foreshore, increase toward the South. Slopes: Slopes increase from North to South. With relationship to the foreshore, the slopes are had increasing through the time and all the beaches have had important variations equally. In the discussion, morphodynamics and grain sizes were evaluated, considering specially the dynamics of beaches composed of sand and gravel. The human impact was evaluated in relation to groin construction, nourishment works, buildings at the beach, dune afforestation and sand mining. The conclusions sustain the idea of four interaction processes: 1) seasonal cycles, 2) storms and flood effects, 3) human impact, 4) presence of sand ridges that modify the angle of incidence of the waves producing local effects. The refilled beaches have passed of being reflective to dissipative; as it has only modified slopes and grain size (but not climate of waves), there is still erosive. Erosive beaches have higher slopes (more than 4%). The increase of the slope toward the North indicates more narrow beaches with smaller areas of dry sand. Southeastern beaches are therefore more vulnerable to storm effects. The differential refraction of the waves in the Southeast, generates the continuous energy concentration in certain places of the coast (for example the cliffs in Mar del Plata). Induced for sand ridges there is convergence -erosion- and divergence -sedimentation- of orthogonal separated by few kilometres of distance. The protection of the coast cannot be considered as an individual responsibility, and for it, although local solutions exist, they don't work to regional scale; therefore, the coastal defence should be a cooperative effort among all the coastal municipalities.","En las costas del sudeste de Buenos Aires hay dos relieves geomorfológicos de importancia, las playas arenosas bajas con grandes campos de médanos, y las playas de bolsillo ubicadas entre acantilados de loess u ortocuarcitas. Al Norte y Sur de la ciudad de Mar del Plata, hay extensos campos de médanos que conforman la Barrera Oriental y Austral. La conformación de estas costas es relativamente moderna ya que se han formado con posterioridad a la fluctuación holocena del nivel del mar. El objetivo del presente estudio se centró en analizar los cambios morfológicos naturales y artificiales de las playas de los partidos de Pinamar, Villa Gesell, Mar Chiquita, General Pueyrredón, General Alvarado, Lobería y Necochea, mediante la descripción y discusión de resultados obtenidos en relevamientos de playa realizados desde 1983 al 2004, con especial énfasis en la dinámica sedimentaria de sus playas y las características físicas naturales o introducidas por el hombre, como por ejemplo construcción de obras de defensa o movimiento de arenas. Los relevamientos se ejecutaron en playas con diferente orientación, dinámica, cantidad y calidad de sedimento, así como distinto grado de alteración producido por las actividades humanas. Los perfiles permitieron analizar la magnitud y velocidad de los cambios morfológicos, al tiempo que se estudiaron las variaciones texturales de las distintas zonas de la playa, reconociendo su variabilidad y la significación estadística de la misma. El trabajo se basó en la comparación de relevamientos planialtimétricos de las playas según métodos convencionales, en la evaluación de las características físicas de las olas que llegan a ellas para alcanzar una clasificación morfodinámica basada en las ecuaciones del número de Dean, parámetro W, el número de Battjes y el parámetro de Guza e Inman. Las texturas se analizaron de muestreos superficiales de sedimentos de la playa distal y de playa frontal mediante los parámetros de Folk y Ward. También fueron evaluadas las pendientes de las playas. En la discusión se evaluó la morfodinámica de playas, sus texturas, la respuesta de las playas mixtas de arena/grava, los ciclos estacionales, tormentas sudestadas y eventos El Niño, así como el efecto de las dorsales de arena (sand ridges) y la refracción. También se evalúa la actividad antrópica, con la construcción de espigones, el relleno artificial, las construcciones sobre la playa, los pluviales, la fijación de médanos y las actividades extractivas. Las conclusiones sostienen la idea de cuatro procesos que interactúan en las modificaciones morfodinámicas de las playas analizadas como son los ciclos estacionales invierno/verano, los ciclos episódicos ligados a períodos tormentosos y de inundaciones, los efectos antrópicos, y la presencia de bancos arenosos submareales que modifican el ángulo de incidencia de las olas produciendo efectos locales.",,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,10,7,22,,,1851-4979,,,,,,,,,,,CONICETUniversidad Nacional de Mar del Plata,CONICETUniversidad Nacional de Mar del Plata,,,2006-07-01,SCIELO:S1851-49792006000100002,,

The more frequent use of larger jack-ups in highly stratified regions, such as the Sunda Shelf in Southeast Asia, contributes to this concerning increase in punch-through incidents, which can lead to buckling of a leg or even toppling of the rig. An industry practice known as perforation drilling is sometimes used to mitigate the punch-through risk in layered clays, extracting soil from the upper strong layer before the jack-up is installed. This paper reports results from centrifuge model tests exploring the efficiency of perforation drilling. The soil conditions tested simulate offshore strength profiles that have reported punch-through failures. An experimental method for drilling sites in an enhanced gravity centrifuge environment was developed and the installation responses of model spudcan foundations penetrating through multi-layered clays with interbedded stiff layers were recorded. The experimental results show that the removal of soil inside the spudcan perimeter, with an area of 9% perforated, eliminated rapid leg run and severe punch-through on the two- and four-layer seabed profiles tested. This confirms the effectiveness of perforation drilling and indicates how the offshore drilling plan may be optimized.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,12,,,0008-3674,1208-6010,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, COFS, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",,,,2012-02-07,WOS:000298208200006,,

It is thus very important to check in which offshore region of the Polish coast the littlest consequences of the OWE construction may be expected. The area of 9000 km(2) in the central part of the Polish economic zone was selected for sediments sampling. In total, sediments from 46 stations were collected by gravity twin corer or geo-vibro corer. Heavy metal (Hg, Pb, Cd, As, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Fe, Mn) concentrations were measured by AAS and ICP-MS while (137) Cs activity concentrations were measured by gamma spectrometer. Sediment accumulation rates were quantified by Pb-210 geochronology at 7 stations to follow the history of contaminants accumulation. Study areas located between isobaths of 20 m and 40 m were characterized by the lowest concentration of heavy metals, often below natural environmental background (e.g. Pb = 6.7 - 11.4 mu g. g(-1), As = 0.3 - 8.4 mu g.g(-1)). The largest contamination by heavy metals (e.g. Pb reached 86.1 mu g.g(-1) while As = 21.0 mu g.g(-1)) was visible at the outer part of Bornholm Basin and in Slupsk Furrow, the deepest studied regions. Highest accumulation of heavy metals in this area is connected to large fraction of pelite sediments and large proportion of organic matter at those stations. It may be concluded that shallow sandy sediments of the Southern Baltic are unpolluted and appropriate for OWE construction. Deeper sea regions e.g Slupsk Furrow and Bornholm Basin may be regarded as moderately polluted and therefore not recommended for OWE acquisition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Several environmental parameters were measured and bacterial assemblages were analyzed by 16S-rDNA pyrosequencing. The average OTU found per sample was 527.3 +/- 122.5, showing similar richness and diversity among them. However, sites having the highest and lowest salinity displayed higher bacterial diversity. Assemblages from a site nearby an oil refinery, showing the lowest salinity and oxygen concentration, were clearly distinct from the rest. The weight of this splitting relied on OTUs belonging to Thauera, known by its ability to metabolize aromatic compounds. Our results suggest that intertidal bacterial assemblages would be structured by major estuarine variables such as salinity, and that anthropogenic-induced environmental parameters might also be relevant.

This will in turn rely on ensuring adequate supply and survival of propagules - for the main habitat-forming taxa of coastal marine ecosystems these are mainly fruits, seeds, viviparous seedlings, zoospores or larvae. The likelihood of propagule survival - and so restoration success - depends on species- and context-specific knowledge to guide choices about appropriate methods to use. Here, we briefly review life-histories of the main habitat-forming taxa of six coastal marine ecosystems: mangrove forests, tidal marshes, seagrass meadows, kelp forests, coral reefs and bivalve reefs. Restoration of several of these ecosystems has long harnessed the unique properties of propagules, sometimes because they are simple to use (for example, planting propagules of some mangroves), and sometimes because we can draw on knowledge gained from other applications (for example using knowledge of oyster culture to restore bivalve reefs). For other ecosystems, like seagrass meadows, kelp forests and coral reefs, propagules have not yet been widely used, but there is compelling evidence that they can be. Most restoration efforts have used relatively simple techniques, such as manual collection and direct planting or seeding. Some approaches use more complex techniques which include a stage in which propagules are reared in nurseries or aquaria to a size or age at which they are viable, when they are then planted or released at the site to be restored. Other approaches use minimal intervention, and focus instead on providing the conditions that will promote growth from naturally dispersed propagules (such as restoring hydrological conditions to facilitate mangrove recruitment). Future approaches could incorporate knowledge applied from other fields, such as genetics and agriculture, and harness the possibilities provided by technology. Understanding the importance of propagule quality will likely also yield insights, as will effective use of models to help refine restoration methods for testing. Deeper partnerships between practitioners and researchers will help test and develop better methods so that we can learn from each other and strive to improve.

In this study, we characterized the trade-offs between (a) urban development and individual mangrove environmental indicators (habitat quality and ecosystem services), and (b) between different environmental indicators in the tropical nation of Singapore. A range of biological, biophysical, and cultural indicators, including carbon, charcoal production, support for offshore fisheries, recreation, and habitat quality for a threatened species were quantified using field-based, remote sensing, and expert survey methods. The shape of the trade-off Pareto frontiers was analyzed to assess the sensitivity of environmental indicators for development. When traded off individually with urban development, four out of five environmental indicators were insensitive to development, meaning that relatively minor degradation of the indicator occurred while development was below a certain threshold, although indicator loss accelerated once this threshold was reached. Most of the pairwise relationships between the five environmental indicators were synergistic; only carbon storage and charcoal production, and charcoal production and recreational accessibility showed trade-offs. Trade-off analysis and land use optimization using Pareto frontiers could be a useful decision-support tool for understanding how changes in land use and coastal management will impact the ability of ecosystems to provide environmental benefits.",,,,,,,,,30,2,0,0,15,0,33,,,0364-152X,1432-1009,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, 1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, SingaporeSingapore ETH Ctr, Future Cities Lab, ETH Zurich, 1 Create Way,06-01 Create Tower, Singapore 138602, Singapore",Singapore ETH Ctr,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000412755900012,28835991,

Sea walls rigidly separated the land from the sea. Dynamic transitional habitats have vanished. Areal loss has diminished the capacity of the Wadden Sea to dissipate wave and tidal energy. A coastal ecosystem once rich in marsh plants, seagrass and diatoms on mud flats became transformed into one with less autochthonous phototroph production, dominated by sandy tidal flats, and dependent primarily on allochthonous plankton supply. The large estuaries have been dredged to serve as shipping canals, and have lost most of their former retention and filter capacity. Riverine loads are now flushed right into the North Sea.

To achieve this goal, the Norwegian oil and gas industry initiated the Zero Discharge Programme for discharges of produced formation water from the hydrocarbon-containing reservoir, in close communication with regulators. The environmental impact factor (EIF), a risk-based management tool, was developed by the industry to quantify and document the environmental risks from produced water discharges. The EIF represents a volume of recipient water containing concentrations of one or more substances to a level exceeding a generic threshold for ecotoxicological effects. In addition, this tool facilitates the identification and selection of cost-effective risk mitigation measures. The EIF tool has been used by all operators on the Norwegian continental shelf since 2002 to report progress toward the goal of zero discharge, interpreted as zero harmful discharges, to the regulators. Even though produced water volumes have increased by approximately 30% between 2002 and 2008 on the Norwegian continental shelf, the total environmental risk from produced water discharges expressed by the summed EIF for all installations has been reduced by approximately 55%. The total amount of oil discharged to the sea has been reduced by 18% over the period 2000 to 2006. The experience from the Zero Discharge Programme shows that a risk-based approach is an excellent working tool to reduce discharges of potential harmful substances from offshore oil and gas installations.

There is a multitude of uses in the seas worldwide: fishing, shipping, tourism, exploitation of oil and gas, sea-bed mining, waste disposal, etc. They all compete for space and resources. Each of them has its specific impact on marine ecosystems. Furthermore, they interact with each other and with the marine environment. Fisheries are the most deleterious interactions of man with marine ecosystems by withdrawing a major part of the annual production of large fish, molluscs and crustacea. Many marine habitats are destroyed by fishing, particularly by heavy bottom trawling.Basics of Fisheries. The production of a fish stock can be increased by removing the old fish. Fishing is sustainable as long as it is restricted to the removal of the surplus production. Subventions and market forces are opposed the rational way of effort reduction aiming at the recovery of overexploited stocks. Fishing has collateral effects on target species. Heavy selective fishing of large, slow-growing predatory fish will favour small, fast-growing species of a lower level in the trophic pyramid. Fishing in marine ecosystems is a complex process in which biological and economic factors interact. At different scales of space ment. Climatic variations and global warming of the Ocean differ in their effects from region to region, and they affect distribution, composition and fishing yield of the various exploited fish stocks. Politics has a major impact on the development of fisheries; historical examples are the collapse of the Eastern Bloc with its big distant water fishing fleets, or the introduction of the 200 nm Economic Zones, putting most fish stocks under national jurisdiction.Discussion. Fishery science is still striving to understand the variability of year-class strength in fish stocks. In the foreground of modern research, however, are the interactions in multi-species communities in relation to changes in the abiotic and biotic environment and to different kinds of management. We have no possibility to study the complex interactions in marine fish communities by controlled experiments. The only information we have are records on landings and fishing efforts. They provide the basis for sophisticated mathematical models. Ecosystem modelling is a relatively young field in marine ecology. In Europe and North America fishery science is more than hundred years old. It is not possible, however, to apply the methods and models of, e.g., North Sea research to low latitude ecosystems and fisheries.Conclusions. The sustainable use and protection of the marine living resources and biodiversity are global challenges. Each Large Marine Ecosystem calls for specific solutions in terms of research and management. Problems have to be tackled not only by computer models and remote sensing, but also by field research in all parts of the world. The further development of marine and fisheries research in developing countries is a matter of north-south-partnerships with high win-win spin-offs. Over the past decades some excellent groups of marine scientists from several tropical countries have been established who are very open for partnership projects in the true sense. They offer great opportunities to jointly study the richness of marine fauna, flora, and ecosystems in tropical and subtropical shelf seas and up-welling regions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0934-3504,1865-5084,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Kiel, Inst Polarokol, Wischhofstr 1-3,Geb 12, D-24148 Kiel, Germany",,,,2008-04-01,BCI:BCI200800376143,,

Wake regions of AR modules (reef ball, cylinder reef, and cube reef) and sets were numerically estimated considering tropical seawater temperatures and water flow variation in Vietnamese coastal waters. In addition, we considered an efficiency index (i.e., total wake volume per reef volume) and wake volume diagram (i.e., wake volume dependency on water flow direction) to characterize wake volumes. From the results, first, it was found that the effect of temperature on the wake volumes was minor in comparison with the effect of flow direction. It was also found that the optimum installation angles were 30 degrees (reef ball and its set), 30 degrees (cylinder reef and its set), and 0 degrees (cube and its set) along the major flow direction. Second, it was found that the cylinder reef and its set were attractive because they generated the maximum wake volumes, regardless of seawater temperature. Thus, the module and set showed better average efficiency indices (9.28 for module and 6.81 for set) than the other cases.

Natural terrestrial run-off of iron is non-existent and aerial deposition is extremely low. However, a number of ship groundings have occurred on these atolls. The reefs surrounding the shipwreck debris are characterized by high benthic cover of turf algae, macroalgae, cyanobacterial mats and corallimorphs, as well as particulate-laden, cloudy water. These sites also have very low coral and crustose coralline algal cover and are call black reefs because of the dark-colored benthic community and reduced clarity of the overlying water column. Here we use a combination of benthic surveys, chemistry, metagenomics and microcosms to investigate if and how shipwrecks initiate and maintain black reefs. Comparative surveys show that the live coral cover was reduced from 40 to 60% to <10% on black reefs on Millennium, Tabuaeran and Kingman. These three sites are relatively large (>0.75 km(2)). The phase shift occurs rapidly; the Kingman black reef formed within 3 years of the ship grounding. Iron concentrations in algae tissue from the Millennium black reef site were six times higher than in algae collected from reference sites. Metagenomic sequencing of the Millennium Atoll black reef-associated microbial community was enriched in iron-associated virulence genes and known pathogens. Microcosm experiments showed that corals were killed by black reef rubble through microbial activity. Together these results demonstrate that shipwrecks and their associated iron pose significant threats to coral reefs in iron-limited regions.

The principal driver is the planned exploitation of substantial marine aggregate resources in this area and the need to place these resources in a wider spatial context to inform management decisions relating to sustainable use and conservation. The EECMHM study provides this context through regional scale geological and biological interpretations and will contribute to the effective stewardship of the marine environment by providing a broader understanding of how the potential resource areas relate to the wider regional ecology and physical processes. The study covers an extensive sea bed area of approximately 5090 km2 between Selsey Bill and Dungeness, out to the UK/France median line, centred on ten current aggregate licence application areas. Survey strategy The survey strategy adopted for the study reflected the requirement to cover a large area within budget, provide information on the regional distribution of dominant habitat types and on the presence or absence of 'rocky reef' habitat listed under Annex 1 of the EU Habitats Directive. The surveys were based on a 'corridor grid' design to maximise spatial coverage, with the corridors covered by geophysical survey followed by a campaign of directed ground-truth sampling. Thirty eight corridors up to 120 km long, [approximately]500 m wide and spaced between 2 and 16 km apart were completed for geophysical data using multibeam, sidescan sonar and sub-bottom profiling. Approximately 6000 line km of geophysical data were collected. Subsequent ground-truth surveys used a suite of complementary techniques targeting a proportion of the grid nodes and specific sea bed features interpreted from the geophysical surveys. Sampling effort was weighted [approximately]60% towards grabs (0.1m2 Hamon grab) as these provide quantitative data on both the sea bed substrate and their infaunal communities. The remaining effort was split between 2-metre beam trawls and drop-down camera techniques (video and stills), providing semi quantitative data on epifauna and substrate-type. A total of 225 grab, 73 beam trawl and 65 video stations were collected. No replicate samples were taken. Some data from aggregate company surveys were included in the interpretation. Geological interpretation Characteristic or common physical and geological features enabled five Physical Regions to be distinguished in the study area, namely: Region 1 - Northern Palaeovalley and Margin (1260 km2) Region 2 - North-East Platform and Margin (350 km2) Region 3 - Western Axial Platform (1050 km2) Region 4 - Central Axial Platform (1640 km2) Region 5 - Greater Bassurelle Sands (790 km2)A series of palaeochannels cut into bedrock during the Quaternary period (last 2 Million years) lie beneath Region 4 and 5. The Quaternary deposits over the palaeochannel systems in Region 4 generally constitute the resource material for marine aggregate. All bar one of the aggregate licence application areas fall within Region 4. Although bedrock of solid geology underlies the whole EECMHM study area, it is only where it is exposed orcovered by thin sediment that rock will influence sea bed habitat. Elsewhere thicker Quaternary and mobile sediment provides the sea bed surface for habitat. In terms of sea bed character around 43% of the study area is covered by rock and thin sediment (<1.5 m thick), 27% by coarse sediment and 30% by sandy sediment. Rock and thin sediment extends over much of the two northern Regions (1 and 2), and is particularly extensive in the south-west in Region 3. Coarse sediment dominates Region 4 in the central south of the study area with sandy sediment increasing in significance to the east and encompassing all of Region 5 in the south-east. The areas of current aggregate licence applications are concentrated in Region 4. Both the areas of coarse sediment and much of rock and thin sediment are particularly scarce in sandy bedforms. Sand waves are most common in the north and east of Region 5, where there is an extensive sand wave field. Sand streaks, patches, sand ribbons and megaripple trains are more common in the two northern regions. Grab sample analysis showed Region 1, 2 and 5 are dominated by sandy sediment, especially gravelly sand. Region 1 and 2 include some areas of sandy gravel but this is most extensive in Region 4 and extends westward into Region 3, which also has an extensive area of muddy sandy gravel at its core. Video footage showed Region 3 is also characterised by a cobble-rich sediment veneer on Tertiary and Chalk rock outcrop, the underlying rock providing the source for a significant proportion of the sea bed gravel, particularly the cobbles and boulders. From west to east across the three southern regions (3, 4 and 5) there is a grain size trend of increasing sand content and decreasing gravel content. The west to east sediment fining trend can be related to a number of factors including: - The extensive area of immobile rock and coarse sediment with cobbles in the west in Region 3. Predominantly gravelly Quaternary sediment infilling the channel systems which underlie the central Region 4. The winnowing and transport of finer sediment from these coarse substrates towards the north and east. In Region 5, seismic records provide evidence of long term eastward sand transport with the deposition of a thin transgressive sand sheet immediately beneath the sea bed. This provides an important context in which to view the potential remobilisation of similar fine sediment resulting from proposed aggregate extraction, feeding into a natural process of transport and deposition. Biological interpretation Data from grabs, trawls and camera techniques were treated separately, using a suite of multivariate analyses, including clustering techniques, to determine groups of samples that could reasonably be interpreted to represent broadscale biotope classes. A suite of environmental variables were analysed to determine which combination of variables best matched the observed patterns in the faunal communities. The physical and biological descriptors of the biotopes were subsequently matched against The Marine Habitat Classification for Britain and Ireland v 04.05 (Connor et al., 2004). Cluster analysis for grab samples showed 28 infaunal groups. Selection criteria were applied to exclude those groups that were poorly represented, leaving a total of nine Infaunal Biotopes (IB). One of these, IB4 was subdivided into 4a and 4b, to reflect the greater abundance of the bivalve Glycymeris in the latter. Most groups showed some spatial relationship; only IB6 occurred at spatially isolated stations. Analysis for beam trawl samples identified 14 epifaunal groups, nine of which showed a spatial relationship giving some insight into the distribution of regional epifaunal biotopes. This was complemented by a consolidated interpretation of the video and stills analyses that grouped the observed stations into seven broad biotope classes. The concurring evidence from beam trawl and video/still photo analyses enabled the identification of 11 'Epifaunal Biotope Complexes' (EBC). Integrated assessment and map production An integrated assessment of the geological and biological interpretations generated thematic regional scale habitat maps of the distribution of Infaunal Biotopes and Epifaunal Biotope Complexes. While the extent of each of the mapped polygons reflects a spatial association of sampling stations assigned to the same biotope group, the precise placement of borders between polygons relied heavily on geological mapping, particularly of the sea bed sediments and sea bed character. In some cases the placement of boundaries was speculative due to the relatively low density of sampling stations and evidence of sea bed heterogeneity or extensive transition zones between some sea bed types. The principal characteristics of the morphology, geology, sediments, biology, habitats and biotopes of the study area have been integrated within the physical region framework produced for the study area and are outlined in a summary table for each of the five Physical Regions. Few of the mapped biotopes were exclusive to any one region; a notable exception being those associated with the cobble substrates in Region 3. The biotopes often straddled borders between Physical Regions and this was more marked for the Epifaunal Biotope Complexes as epifauna tend to show lower fidelity and exclusivity to particular substrate types than infauna. A number of anthropogenic features and impacts on the sea bed were evident in some areas including a variety of wrecks and fishing gear trawl marks Principal Conclusions Large scale geological processes and features are evident across the study area and influence the nature of the sea bed and the distribution of sediment and biotopes. The physical nature of the sea bed appears to be one of the most important factors in controlling the form, diversity and frequency of taxa particularly sediment grain size and sea bed substrate type with distinctions between areas of sand, and gravel/cobble dominance, the latter having a more diverse biotope. Difficulties were experienced in assigning biotopes to the infaunal and epifaunal assemblages identified by this study using The Marine Habitat Classification for Britain and Ireland v 04.05 (Connor et al., 2004). Matches could be made at the rudimentary levels of the classification hierarchy, which deals mostly with the physical characteristics of the habitats, but were more equivocal at higher levels of the classification dealing with faunal assemblages, indicating a need to further develop these higher levels with respect to 'offshore' biotopes. No extensive areas of potential Annex 1 'rocky reef' habitat were noted. However, the western tip of the Bassurelle Bank extends into the south east corner of the study area and may have some characteristics of the Annex 1 habitat Sandbanks which are slightly covered by sea water all the time. The multidisciplinary approach of marrying geophysical nd physical techniques and interpretations is recommended for future marine habitat mapping studies.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1467-5609,,,,,,,,,,,"British Geological Survey, Kingsley Dunham Centre, Nicker Hill, Keyworth, Nottingham, NG12 5GG, United Kingdom",,,,2007-07-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14405031108,,

A significant proportion of global CO2 storage capacity is located offshore, with some regions of the world having no onshore stores. To assure regulatory bodies and the public of CO2 storage integrity it is important to demonstrate that robust offshore monitoring systems are in place. A range of chemical tracers for leakage have been tested at onshore pilot CCS projects worldwide, but to date they have not been trialled at injection projects or CO2 release experiments located offshore. Here, for the first time, we critically review the current issues surrounding commercial scale use of tracers for offshore CCS projects, and examine the constraints and cost implications posed by the marine environment. These constraints include the logistics of sampling for tracers offshore, the fate of tracers in marine environments, tracer background levels, marine toxicity and legislative barriers - with particular focus on the Europe and the UK. It is clear that chemicals that form a natural component of the CO2 stream are preferable tracers for ease of permitting and avoiding cost and risks of procuring and artificially adding a tracer. However, added tracers offer more reliability in terms of their unique composition and the ability to control and regulate concentrations. We identify helium and xenon isotopes (particularly 124,129Xe), and artificial tracers such as PFCs and deuterated methane as the most suitable added tracers. This is due to their conservative behaviour, low environmental impact and relative inexpense. Importantly, we also find that SF6 and C-14 are not viable tracers for CCS due to environmental concerns, and many other potential tracers can be ruled out on the basis of cost. Further, we identify key challenges that are unique to using tracers for offshore monitoring, and highlight critical uncertainties that future work should address. These include possible adsorption or dispersion of tracer compounds during ascent through the overburden, longevity of tracers over the timeframes relevant for CCS monitoring, the permissible environmental effects of tracer leakage, and tracer behaviour in seabed CO2 bubble streams and in dissolved CO2. These uncertainties directly affect the selection of appropriate tracers, the injection program and concentrations necessary for their reliable detection, and appropriate sampling approaches. Hence offshore tracer selection and associated expense are currently poorly constrained. Further, there is limited experience of sampling for tracers in the marine environment; current approaches are expensive and must be streamlined to enable affordable monitoring strategies. Further work is necessary to address these unknowns so as to evaluate the performance of potential tracers for CO2 leak quantitation and provide more accurate costings for effective offshore tracer monitoring programs.",,,,,,,,,35,1,0,0,5,1,36,,,1750-5836,1878-0148,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Strathclyde, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Glasgow G1 1XJ, Lanark, ScotlandUniv Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh EH9 3FE, Midlothian, ScotlandCSIRO Energy, Natl Geosequestrat Lab, 26 Dick Perry Ave, Kensington, NSW 6151, Australia",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000412457800020,,

The stabilization process used in the construction of the reef bricks reduced the extractability of PAH from reef bricks by hot organic solvents. Because of the toxicity of some PAH, there is concern for leaching of the PAH by seawater from the waste ash used for construction of the reef. Leaching studies of the reef materials with seawater, however, indicated PAH are retained within the reef materials and that seawater is not an effective medium for removing PAH from reef bricks or the ash. Furthermore, the reef materials were found to adsorb PAH from the seawater phase.

Fibreglass was used to make specially designed reef enhancement units (REUs) for three reef sites in Singapore. Units were established in areas measuring approximately 20 x 50 m.2. The units are compact and light enough to be deployed from small boats by Scuba divers, and are suitable for shallow reefs with limited visibility.3. The design of the REUs precludes excessive sediment build-up on the settlement Surfaces, while allowing water currents to flow through the system.4. The REUs were monitored monthly over two years to observe community development and scleractinian coral recruitment Oil the exterior Surfaces. Recruitment was compared between REUs and rubble quadrats at one study site.5. The REUs were colonized by WIT algae within the first month, followed by crustose coralline algae, macroalgae, ascidians and hydroids. At the end of two years, the percentage cover Of crustose coralline algae at all three sites was more than 50%.6. The first incidence of coral recruitment was six months post deployment, and recruitment rates at the end of the monitoring period ranged from 0.10 to 4.75 recruits per square metre for the three sites. Recruits show better Survival and growth on REUs compared to rubble areas.7. The most abundant recruit was Pocillopora damicornis, followed by favids, acroporids and poritids.

In order to develop a current and more comprehensive estimate of fecundity, we collected California sheephead from seven locations off southern California throughout the spawning season (July through September). To estimate both total fecundity and batch fecundity, we categorized and counted oocytes from ovarian subsamples of 28 and 24 (respectively) mature females (stage 3, spawning capable; determined by histological analysis). Total and batch fecundity increased with somatic mass, standard length, and ovary mass. We found total fecundity to increase with somatic mass to a power of 5.5, which is considerably greater than the value (2.95) reported previously.

Coastal reclamation causes the destruction and severe degradation of wetland ecosystems, which may affect their abilities to store blue carbon. To assist with international accords on blue carbon, we evaluated the dynamics of blue carbon storage in coastal wetlands under coastal reclamation in China. By integrating carbon density data collected from field measurement experiments and from the literature, an InVEST model, Carbon Storage and Sequestration was used to estimate carbon storage across the reclamation area between 1990 and 2015. The result is the first map capable of informing about blue carbon storage in coastal reclamation areas on a national scale. We found that more than 380,000 hectares of coastal wetlands were affected by reclamation, which resulted in the release of ca. 20.7 Tg of blue carbon. The carbon loss from natural wetlands to artificial wetlands accounted for 72.5% of total carbon loss, which highlights the major task in managing coastal sustainability. In addition, the top 20% of coastal wetlands in carbon storage loss covered 4.2% of the total reclamation area, which can be applied as critical information for coastal redline planning. We conclude that the release of blue carbon due to the conversion of natural wetlands exceeded the total carbon emission from energy consumption within the reclamation area.

Scale model experiments are performed with respect to different density difference heads, horizontal current velocities, and tube geometries. The results show that the downwelling flow rate is dependent on horizontal current velocity, tube geometry parameters, and the density profile of ambient water. In addition, increasing the equivalent diameter and bend radius of the device can decrease the total loss coefficient in the tube, which in turns enhance the downwelling efficiency. The two symmetrical-guide plates also generate obvious downwelling of surface water which further improves the whole performance of the device.

Sustainable ocean development in the Faroe-Shetland Channel Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area (FSC NCMPA; northeast Atlantic), which harbors sponge aggregations, now requires adaptive management in the face of encroachment of multisectorial activities in this area (e.g., fishing, oil and gas, shipping) and climate change. We examined sponge morphotype composition, richness, diversity, density and body-size distribution inside and outside the FSC NCMPA, and the role of environmental variability and human impact in these sponge aggregations. Analyses were based on the examination of 465 high resolution images from 13 towed-camera transects. A catalog for regional sponge morphotypes was also developed and applied for these analyses. Analysis revealed that morphotype composition did not differ between inside and outside the FSC NCMPA but richness, diversity and densities of massive/spherical/papillate and flabellate/caliculate sponges were higher inside than outside the boundary. The sponge aggregations occurred within a narrow zone between 450 and 530 m depth, within relatively warm and saline water masses. Furthermore, multiple size cohorts of sponges were recorded inside the FSC NCMPA, in contrast to the single cohort outside. Distance-based linear modeling showed that demersal fisheries, substratum, salinity and temperature explained a statistically-significant amount of variation (48%, p < 0.001) of sponge density across the study area. Findings on density and size cohorts suggest that the FSC NCMPA boundary currently encloses the most vulnerable area, which also demonstrates normal ecosystem functions (e.g., recruitment). However, sponges were constrained to a narrow environmental niche shaped by fisheries and interactions of FSC NCMPA water masses with the slope that in turn likely determine, food supply to the sponge aggregations. Our study illustrated the vulnerability of the FSC NCMPA sponge aggregations to fisheries and changes to water mass properties over time. The morphotype catalog and suite of indicators (i.e., density and body-size distribution) allow for baseline and future assessments of anthropogenic and climate change impacts on sponge aggregations' environmental status in the FSC NCMPA, thus guiding management as sectoral encroachment continues in this area.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,22,0,28,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Grant Inst, Changing Oceans Lab, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandHeriot Watt Univ, Sch Energy Geosci Infrastruct & Soc, Inst Life Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandMarine Scotland, Marine Lab, Aberdeen, Scotland",,,,2019-04-09,WOS:000465441700001,,

For CCS to work, there must be effectively no leakage from the injection site, so the nature of the top-seal is an important aspect for consideration when appraising prospective CCS opportunities. The Lower Cretaceous Rodby Shale and the Palaeocene Lista Shale have acted as seals to oil and gas accumulations (e.g., the Atlantic and Balmoral fields) and may now play a critical role in sealing the Acorn and East Mey subsurface carbon storage sites. The characteristics of these important shales have been little addressed in the hydrocarbon extraction phase, with an understandable focus on reservoir properties and their influence on resource recovery rates. Here, we assess the characteristics of the Rodby and Lista Shales using wireline logs, geomechanical tests, special core analysis (mercury intrusion) and mineralogical and petrographic techniques, with the aim of highlighting key properties that identify them as suitable top-seals. The two shales, defined using the relative gamma log values (or Vshale), have similar mean pore throat radius (approximately 18 nm), splitting tensile strength (approximately 2.5 MPa) and anisotropic values of splitting tensile strength, but they display significant differences in terms of wireline log character, porosity and mineralogy. The Lower Cretaceous Rodby Shale has a mean porosity of approximately 14 %, a mean permeability of 263 nD (2.58 x 10(-19)m(2)), and is calcite rich and has clay minerals that are relatively rich in non-radioactive phases such as kaolinite. The Palaeocene Lista Shale has a mean porosity of approximately 16% a mean permeability of 225 nD (2.21 x 10(-19)m(2)), and is calcite free, but contains abundant quartz silt and is dominated by smectite. The 2% difference in porosity does not seem to equate to a significant difference in permeability. Elastic properties derived from wireline log data show that Young's modulus, material stiffness, is very low (5 GPa) for the most shale (clay mineral)-rich Rodby intervals, with Young's modulus increasing as shale content decreases and as cementation (e.g., calcite) increases. Our work has shown that Young's modulus, which can be used to inform the likeliness of tensile failure, may be predictable based on routine gamma, density and compressive sonic logs in the majority of wells where the less common shear logs were not collected. The predictability of Young's modulus from routine well log data could form a valuable element of CCS-site top-seal appraisals. This study has shown that the Rodby and Lista Shales represent good top-seals to the Acorn and East Mey CCS sites and they can hold CO(2)column heights of approximately 380 m.

Seeps area dynamic component of the carbon cycle and can be important indicators for economically significant hydrocarbon deposits. The northern Gulf of Mexico contains hundreds of active seeps that can be studied experimentally with the use of submarines and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV). Hydrocarbon flux through surface sediments profoundly alters benthic ecology and seafloorgeology at seeps. In water depths of 500-2000 m, rapid gas flux results in shallow, metastable deposits of gas hydrate, which reduce sediment porosity and affect seepage rates. This paper details the processes that occur during the final, brief transition - as oil and gas escape from the seafloor, rise through the water and dissolve, are consumed by microbial processes, or disperse into the atmosphere. The geology of the upper sediment column determines whether discharge is rapid and episodic, as occurs in mud volcanoes, or more gradual and steady, as occurs where the seep orifice is plugged with gas hydrate. in both cases, seep oil and gas appear to rise through the water in close proximity instead of separating. Chemical alteration of the oil is relatively minor during transit through the water column, but once at the sea surface its more volatile components rapidly evaporate. Gas bubbles rapidly dissolve as they rise, although observations suggest that oil coatings on the bubbles inhibit dissolution. At the sea surface, the floating oil forms slicks, detectable by remote sensing, whose origins are laterally within similar to1000 m of the seafloor vent. This contradicts the much larger distance predicted if oil drops rise through a 500 m water column at an expected rate of similar to0.01 m s(-1) while subjected to lateral currents of similar to0.2 m s(-1) or greater. It indicates that oil rises with the gas bubbles at speeds of similar to0.15 m s(-1) all the way to the surface.",,,,,,,,,167,16,3,0,41,0,216,,,1468-8115,,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, GERG, College Stn, TX 77843 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chem, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAEarth Satellite Corp, Rockville, MD USA",Earth Satellite Corp,,,2002-05-01,WOS:000180445900003,,

An integration of natural and social sciences research is required by policy-makers to better understand, and manage sustainably, natural changes and anthropogenic activities within particular marine systems. Given the uncertain development of activities in the marine environment, future scenarios assessments can be used to investigate whether marine policy measures are robust and sustainable. This paper develops an interdisciplinary framework, which incorporates future scenarios assessments, and identifies four main types of evaluation needed to integrate natural and social sciences research to support the integrated management of the marine environment: environmental policy and governance assessments; ecosystem services, indicators and valuation; modelling tools for management evaluations, and risk assessment and risk management. The importance of stakeholder engagement within each evaluation method is highlighted. The paper focuses on the transnational spatial marine management of the Dogger Bank, in the central North Sea, a site which is very important ecologically, economically and politically. Current management practices are reviewed, and research tools to support future management decisions are applied and discussed in relation to two main vectors of change affecting the Dogger Bank, namely commercial fisheries and offshore wind farm developments, and in relation to the need for nature conservation. The input of local knowledge through stakeholder engagement is highlighted as a necessary requirement to produce site specific policy recommendations for the future management of the Dogger Bank.

We used passive acoustic telemetry to monitor the distribution and movements of summer flounder at an artificial reef during their summer residency in Chesapeake Bay. Larger fish (> 425 mm) primarily occupied deeper waters in close proximity to the reef, whereas smaller fish occupied shallower waters on the periphery of the reef. Mean residency was 54 days, but fish were observed leaving the reef for a brief period during a strong storm. Residency at the reef was sufficient to relate fish (n=42) movements to a spectrum of tidal stages, diurnal period, lunar phases, and temperatures using a generalized linear mixed model. A repeated measures model was used to account for the autocorrelation inherent in observations of individuals through time. Smaller fish were more likely to move than larger fish, especially during the quarter moons. Movement relative to lunar phase was most apparent at night. Movements peaked at 24 degrees C and were least likely at the lowest (< 22 degrees C) and highest (> 27 degrees C) temperatures.

J,,,,,,,,,"LAYMAN, CR, AN.",,FISH AGGREGATIONS AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL HOT SPOTS ACROSS REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 01 2013,2013,"Consumers have long been acknowledged for their role in top-down regulation of ecosystems (resource consumption), but their influence through bottom-up mechanistic pathways (resource supply) is often underappreciated. Namely, through physiological processes of consumption, assimilation and regeneration, consumers cycle nutrients that are readily available for biological uptake by primary producers and microorganisms. Despite seminal research over three decades ago, consumermediated nutrient supply has not been integrated into models of coastal ecosystem dynamics. Yet nutrient supply from consumers may be a regulating factor of ecosystem processes, especially when consumers aggregate, e.g., fishes around structurally complex habitat. Examining this bottom-up mechanistic pathway is essential for a more holistic understanding of seagrass ecosystems - one of the most important, yet threatened, ecosystems globally. Questions that frame the research include: (1) Does concentrated nutrient supply from consumers result in distinct biogeochemical hot spots in seagrass beds?, and (2) How do consumer effects on ecosystem processes vary across regional environmental contexts, i.e., across gradients in nutrient availability and fishing pressure? The experimental design incorporates environmental variation by selecting multiple sites within three biogeographic regions in the Caribbean (The Bahamas, Hispaniola, and Grenada/St.Vincent/Grenadines). The experiments will utilize artificial reefs that mimic natural patch reef habitats by serving to concentrate animals at high densities. Response variables reflecting ecosystem processes (e.g., seagrass nutrient content, seagrass biomass, primary producer diversity) will be measured at reef sites and compared with control sites (seagrass sites without reefs). The spatial extent over which ecosystem processes may be affected, i.e., distance from artificial reef, will be quantified and used to detect ecological thresholds in ecosystem responses. Predictor variables, including measures of ambient nutrient availability, fish densities and fish grazing rates, will be used to contextualize the relative importance of consumer-mediated nutrient supply. The hierarchical experimental design and two-pronged analysis will characterize relationships across environmental gradients (e.g., terrestrial land use practices) found among and within the biogeographic regions, facilitating a conceptual framework needed to predict when, where, and why consumer-mediated nutrient supply is an important control of ecosystems processes in seagrass beds. The project is designed to maximize broader impacts at regional, national, and local levels, through extensive integration of research and education efforts. The entire program is designed in partnership with The Nature Conservancy, for which the PI serves on the Caribbean Advisory Board. The Nature Conservancy is at the forefront of the Caribbean Challenge, an effort to protect 20% of marine habitats by the year 2020. All of the planned study sites are part of current, or proposed, marine protected areas as part of the Caribbean Challenge initiative. Data from the research will inform monitoring plans, management strategies and prioritization of conservation measures. For example, the site in Haiti will be within boundaries of the country's first proposed marine protected area, the design of which the PI is working with The Nature Conservancy to designate. Outreach initiatives at local and national levels, will be designed with sensitivity to local environmental and social opportunities/challenges. We will work with different local partners in each country, crafting educational efforts that are best suited to challenges and opportunities at each individual site. For example, in The Bahamas, the PI will help design and develop a new center on Abaco Island intended to support research, education and conservation activities: ACRE (Abaco Conservation, Research & Education Center). The outreach website The Abaco Scientist will also be expanded, continuing to provide a platform for quick dissemination of information to the general public. Emphasis will be placed on training minority students underrepresented in the sciences through FIU, providing experiences within an integrated science, education, and cross-cultural integration model. As such, the project will provide for broad advances regarding the function of seagrass ecosystems, while being embedded in an extensive outreach context in which conservation and education benefits will be prioritized.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1001040; 599711,,,,,,,,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:12724276,,

The aim of this study is to compare (1) bacterial isolates of pelagic heterotrophic bacteria from two sites, each with a different trophic status (4 mu g/l at Kpass and 23 mu g/l at Layo for chlorophyll index) located in the Ebrie lagoon, and (2) the bacteria associated with periphyton growing on an artificial reef of bamboos stuck into the sediment of the two sites. Hierarchical classifications were performed from morphological and biochemical tests of 343 heterotrophic bacterial strains isolated from the two sites and for each habitat. Despite differences in trophic status, numerical taxonomic analysis of the pelagic bacterial strains (n = 165) showed a dominant cluster (72% of strains) of mixed origin (close to 50% of isolates from each site). The majority of these strains were non-fermentative rods producing neither amino-acids decarboxylases, nor acid from any carbohydrates. In the more eutrophic site (Layo), few differences of proper ties were observed between pelagic and periphyton-associated bacteria. On the contrary, a large part of bacteria isolated from bamboo at Kpass was characterized by specific particularities such as the degradation of arginine, tryptophan and citrate. Numerical taxonomic analysis allowed the distinguishing of specific characteristics of bacteria according to the habitat. Our results suggest that hydrological and biological conditions (especially photosynthetic exudates from periphyton) may induce an obvious specialization of the periphytic bacteria in the less eutrophic ecosystem (Kpass) compared to the bacteria isolated from the more eutrophic environment (Layo).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0003-9136,,,,,,,,,,,"CRO,ORSTOM,ABIDJAN,COTE IVOIREUSTL,LAB HYDROBIOL,F-34060 MONTPELLIER,FRANCE",USTL,,,1997-09-01,WOS:A1997YG77000007,,

Twenty-seven entire tubes were collected ranging from 23 to 60 cm in length and from 0.6 to 13 mm in diameter. Clear annulations were present near the tube openings. Only two of the tubes contained specimens of Lamellibrachia, both lacking most of the posterior portion (including the opisthosoma); the obturaculum was 13 mm long in both specimens; three sheath lamellae and eight branchial lamellae occurred in one specimen, and six and 14 in the other. DNA analysis through COI sequencing suggests a close similarity with specimens collected in the eastern Mediterranean (GenBank EU046616) and belonging to a new species recently described. It needs still to be clarified which type of energy source the obligate symbiotic bacteria of these worms may use for nutrition, since no sulphur emissions can be documented on and around the shipwreck. The 'Catania' contained some wooden structures and was transporting cotton balls and oil seeds, so the symbiotic bacteria may rely on degradation of these materials.

Documentation of the links between climate variability, ecosystem change and predator dynamics is absent for most top predators. Identifying species that may be useful indicators and elucidating these mechanistic links provides insight into current ecological dynamics and may inform predictions of future ecosystem responses to climatic change. We examine humpback whale response to environmental variability through stable isotope analysis of diet over a dynamic 20-year period (1993-2012) in the California Current System (CCS). Humpback whale diets captured two major shifts in oceanographic and ecological conditions in the CCS. Isotopic signatures reflect a diet dominated by krill during periods characterized by positive phases of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), cool sea surface temperature (SST), strong upwelling and high krill biomass. In contrast, humpback whale diets are dominated by schooling fish when the NPGO is negative, SST is warmer, seasonal upwelling is delayed and anchovy and sardine populations display increased biomass and range expansion. These findings demonstrate that humpback whales trophically respond to ecosystem shifts, and as a result, their foraging behavior is a synoptic indicator of oceanographic and ecological conditions across the CCS. Multi-decadal examination of these sentinel species thus provides insight into biological consequences of interannual climate fluctuations, fundamental to advancing ecosystem predictions related to global climate change.",,,,,,,,,97,0,0,0,84,0,111,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla, CA 92037 USANOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USAUniv Alaska Fairbanks, Sch Fisheries & Ocean Sci, POB 757220, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USACascadia Res Collect, Olympia, WA 98501 USA",Cascadia Res Collect,,,2016-03-09,WOS:000370491400021,26599719,

In this study drilling was carried out in the Morvin drill field in proximity to a number of small Lophelia pertusa coral reefs (closest reefs 100 m upstream and 350 m downstream of point of waste drill material release). In a novel monitoring study, ROV video surveys of 9 reefs were conducted prior, during, immediately after and > 1 year after drilling operations. Behavior of coral polyps inhabiting reefs exposed to differing concentrations of drill cuttings and drilling fluids (waste drilling material) were compared. Levels of expected exposure to these waste materials were determined for each reef by modelling drill cutting transport following release, using accurate in-situ hydrodynamic data collected during the drilling period and drill cutting discharge data as parameters of a dispersal model. The presence / absence of associate reef species (Acesta excavata, Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis) were also determined from each survey video. There were no significant differences in Lophelia pertusa polyp behavior in corals modelled to have been exposed to pulses of > 25 ppm drill cutting material and those modelled to be exposed to negligible concentrations of material. From the video data collected, there were no observed degradations of reef structure over time, nor reductions of associate fauna abundance, regardless of modelled exposure concentration at any of the surveyed reefs. This study focused exclusively on adult fauna, and did not assess the potential hazard posed by waste drilling material to coral or other larvae.

Furthermore, climate change increasingly threatens the integrity of marine ecosystems, thereby affecting the economies of coastal communities. Political support for the adoption of offshore renewable energy has increased in order to assist a transition away from carbon-based economies. These drivers have triggered Scotland to construct and implement the world's first sectoral marine plan for tidal energy (SMPTE). As this SMPTE is the first of its kind, it is important to include a quality assurance element in the plan framework. The authors have undertaken a quality management review of Scotland's SMPTE against guidelines set out in the International Council for Exploration of the Sea's Marine Spatial Planning Quality Management System (ICES MSP QMS).

These characteristics are related to the frequency and the intensity of disastrous hydrometeorological phenomena. Organization of long-term observations in offshore areas is often infeasible. current attempts to calculate these characteristics on the basis of interpolation of data obtained on coastal stations are not methodically justified Consequently, the only means of studying these hydrometeorological variables is to use integrated methods that include computer processing of the available data and hydrodynamic and probabilistic modeling.The description of sea levels and currents must include estimates of rare values. The most important features in the hydrodynamics of coastal seas and gulfs are related to motions arising as a result of propagation of long waves through open boundaries. That is why the majority of storm surge studies and prediction methods use 2D hydrodynamic models based on shallow water equations. Design and installation of stationary shelf oil and gas platforms require information about the vertical structure of currents. These characteristics are obtained by the simulation of 3D hydrodynamic models. Probabilistic modeling permits to obtain climate characteristics with long return periods.

Selected species include some protected and non-indigenous species, ecosystem engineers, species sensitive to climate change, and/or threatened by human activities. Taken together, these taxa represent key ecological aspects of Mediterranean subtidal habitats (Cerrano et al., 2017) and can be used to calculate the MedSens, an index of the environmental status of subtidal rocky coastal habitats based on species sensitivity (Turicchia et al., 2021). Observations were carried out by the EcoDivers (trained scuba divers, freedivers and snorkelers) according to a rigorous protocol (RCMed U-CEM) developed by the association Reef Check Italia onlus. Observations were carried out by the EcoDivers (trained scuba divers, freedivers and snorkelers) according to a rigorous protocol (RCMed U-CEM) developed by the association Reef Check Italia onlus. Records include geographic coordinates (decimal degrees, WGS84), site name, date, survey depth range (min and max, in metres), prevailing habitat (from an options list), the sampling size in term of searching time (minutes), taxon name, abundance category (coded from 0 to 6), occurrence depth range (min and max, in metres) and the name of the EcoDiver who made the identification.The Reef Check Med Underwater Coastal Environment Monitoring (RCMed U-CEM) protocol is a Citizen Science initiative, developed by the Italian non-profit association Reef Check Italia onlus, aimed to assess the ecological status of the Mediterranean marine coastal habitats (Cerrano et al., 2017; Turicchia et al., 2021). Taxa were selected based on a combination of criteria including identification easiness and being key indicators of the shifts Mediterranean subtidal habitats may undergo under local pressures and climate change. When it is not easy to discriminate between species, genus level or higher was chosen, as in the case of the two protected Mediterranean seahorses. Before diving, each EcoDiver (i.e. the trained volunteer scuba divers, freedivers and snorkelers) chooses which and how many of the 43 taxa, included in the protocol, will be searched for, according to the expected habitat typology and personal motivations. Abundance (using numerical or descriptive classes according to the countability of organisms) and occurrence depth range (min and max, in metres) of searched taxa are recorded. Taxa actively searched for, but not encountered, are recorded as absent.Diving sites are localised by using global positioning system (GPS) receivers, nautical charts or known points (e.g., mooring buoys at MPAs). Geographical coordinates (WGS84) are recorded with 6 arc-second (i.e. about 200 m) accuracy, which is in the distance range usually explored by divers in a single dive.The adopted abundance categories are (in brackets the corresponding descriptive categories):Category 0: 0 specimens (absent)Category 1: 1 specimen (isolated specimen)Category 2: 2 specimens (some scattered specimens)Category 3: 3-5 specimens (several scattered specimens)Category 4: 6-10 specimens (a crowded area)Category 5: 11-50 specimens (some crowded areas)Category 6: 50 specimens (several crowded areas)The prevailing habitat is identified according to the following categories:- Coastal rocks- Offshore rocks- Rocky cliff- Posidonia- Posidonia and sand- Posidonia and rocks- Cave- Metal wreck- Sand- Mud- Breakwaters and ports- River mouth- Coastal lagoon Copyright: Attribution (CC BY)",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-23,DRCI:DATA2021148022251576,,

It was designed to monitor changes in the distribution and concentrations of selected chemicals in the nearshore Alaskan Beaufort Sea environment and determine if any changes observed were related to offshore oil and gas development activities. Task 5 of cANIMIDA focuses on an assessment of concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), saturated hydrocarbons (SHC), and sterane/triterpane (StTr) petroleum biomarkers, and 13 to 19 metals in soft tissues of representative species of marine bivalve mollusks, crustaceans, and fish from the offshore areas in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea near ongoing or planned oil and gas development activities. This report describes the results of chemical and biochemical monitoring of marine animals collected from the study area during the summers of 2004, 2005, and 2006. There were five objectives for Task 5 of the cANIMIDA Program: Objective 1 [long dash] Improve and validate the Contractor's proposed conceptual model of bioaccumulation and trophic interaction in cANIMIDA biota Objective 2 [long dash] Measure bioaccumulation in selected species by co-collection and analysis of indigenous bivalves, benthic amphipods, and fish and deployment, retrieval, and analysis of caged bivalves and SPMDs Objective 3 - Compare bioaccumulation data to published results for the same or similar species outside the cANIMIDA area Objective 4 - Develop a strategy for longer-term upper trophic contaminant monitoring Objective 5 - Develop a strategy and rationale for future Boulder Patch contaminant monitoring in conjunction with Task Order 006 Biota samples (amphipods, isopods, clams, and fish) were collected and mussels and semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) were deployed and then recovered at several sampling sites near the Northstar production facility, the Liberty prospect, and at reference locations, mostly east (up-current) of development activities. The samples were analyzed for a complete suite of PAH (naphthalene through benzo(ghi)perylene and selected alkyl homologues) and 19 metals (silver, aluminum, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, mercury, manganese, nickel, lead, antimony, selenium, thallium, vanadium, and zinc); fish samples were not analyzed for aluminum, beryllium, cobalt, antimony, and thallium. Clam, amphipod, and isopod tissues also were analyzed for SHC and StTr crude oil biomarkers. Fish tissues were evaluated histochemically for cytochrome P450 mixed function oxygenase (CYP1A) activity and fish bile was analyzed for fluorescent aromatic compounds (FAC) as evidence of PAH exposure. Concentrations of hydrocarbons (PAH, SHC, StTr) and all metals analyzed were relatively low in all three sampling years in tissues of several species of fish, amphipods, isopods, and clams collected in the Northstar and Liberty prospect areas and in reference areas, and in mussels deployed in cages at several Beaufort Sea locations (Tables ES-1 through ES-4). PAH concentrations in all biota were higher in 2004 and 2006 than in 2005 (Tables ES-1 and ES-2). Northstar is the only area in Federal waters of the Alaska outer continental shelf with oil production. PAH concentrations usually were similar in resident marine animals and deployed mussels and SPMDs near Northstar and at other stations in all three years. Table ES[long dash]1. Mean Concentrations of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (TPAH), total saturated hydrocarbons (TSHC), pristane, and steranes/triterpanes (StTr) in tissues of indigenous fish, clams, amphipods, isopods, and mysids collected at several locations in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea in 2004 through 2006. BSMP is the Beaufort Sea Monitoring Program area where monitoring was performed in the ANIMIDA Program. Table ES-2. Mean Concentrations of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (TPAH), total saturated hydrocarbons (TSHC), pristane, and steranes/triterpanes (StTr) in tissues of reference and deployed mussels and of TPAH in blank and deployed SPMDs used to monitor hydrocarbon concentrations in the water column of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea in 2004 through 2006. There were no consistent patterns of concentrations of any metals in tissues of indigenous animals from the different sampling locations. Metals concentrations in soft tissues of fish, amphipods, and clams from all Beaufort Sea sampling locations combined (Table ES-3) and in deployed mussels from Beaufort Sea and reference stations (Table ES-4) were similar in 2004, 2005, and 2006. Concentrations of most metals were lower in fish than in amphipods or clams. Aluminum, iron, and manganese concentrations tended to be higher in clams than in crustaceans, possibly indicating that the clams are retaining sediment particles in the gut and gills. Copper concentrations were higher in amphipods than in clams and fish, probably reflecting the presence of copper-containing respiratory pigments in many crustaceans. Metals concentrations were similar in undeployed reference mussels and mussels that had been deployed in the Beaufort Sea, indicating little exchange of tissue metals during deployment. Concentrations of most metals were similar in indigenous clams and deployed mussels. Table ES[long dash]3. Range of concentrations of metals in soft tissues of combined fish species (up to eight species), amphipods, and clams from all sampling locations in the western Beaufort Sea in 2004, 2005, and 2006. There were no consistent trends in concentrations of hydrocarbons or metals in fish tissues. Demersal species, such as four horn sculpin tended to contain higher concentrations of hydrocarbons and metals than the more pelagic species. The anadromous species, arctic char, tended to contain lower concentrations of metals and hydrocarbons than the other species did, perhaps because they spend more time offshore. Table ES[long dash]4. Range of concentrations of metals in reference mussels and mussels deployed at several stations in the Beaufort Sea in 2004, 2005, and 2006. The concentrations of metals and TPAH in the tissues of most of the bivalve mollusks, crustaceans, and fish sampled in this program were in the range expected for the same or similar species in relatively unpolluted marine environments throughout the world (Table ES-5). Concentrations of different metals vary widely in tissues of different taxa of marine animals. Zinc is particularly abundant in mollusks and copper often is abundant in crustaceans. Mercury tends to be more abundant in fish tissues, particularly muscle, than in tissues of marine invertebrates. PAH usually are more abundant in mollusks than in crustaceans and fish. Fish and crustaceans have a well-developed, inducible cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxygenase system that rapidly metabolizes bioaccumulated PAH, facilitating their excretion. This pattern of distribution of metals and TPAH was evident in bivalve mollusks, crustaceans, and fish in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. Table ES[long dash]5. Concentrations of several metals and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (TPAH) in whole or muscle tissues of marine bivalve mollusks, crustaceans, and fish from unpolluted marine environments throughout the world. Concentrations are [mu]g/g dry wt. From Neff (2002a). An unexpected observation was the extremely high concentrations of pristane in tissues of indigenous amphipods. Pristane is an abundant aliphatic hydrocarbon in petroleum, peat, and in some species of marine plants and animals. Copepods, particularly some species in the genera Calanus and Neocalanus, contain percent levels of pristane in their lipids. Calanoid copepods bioaccumulate phytol, a monounsaturated diterpenyl alcohol that is esterified with chlorophyll, in their phytoplankton food and convert it to pristane; the pristane accumulates to high concentrations in oil droplets in the copepods (Avigan and Blumer, 1968). The benthic amphipods may be bioaccumulating pristane from ingestion of detritus and copepod feces. Indigenous clams and deployed mussels contained much lower concentrations of pristane than amphipods did, indicating a different diet. CYP1A staining and bile FAC analysis were evaluated as biomarkers of petroleum exposure in several species of fish collected in the Beaufort Sea in 2004 and 2005. CYP1A staining was very light in several tissues of five species of fish collected at sampling sites in 2004 and 2005. Usually, CYP1A activity was lower in fish from Northstar than in those collected near Liberty or at other sampling sites. Bile FAC concentrations were similar in fish from Northstar and Liberty in both 2004 and 2005. These results are consistent with the tissue residue data indicating very low-level exposure to PAH, possibly of petroleum, at all stations. Some of the Beaufort Sea fish, crustaceans, and clams contained concentrations of one or more metals higher than the median value for mussels and oysters collected in the National Status and Trends Mussel Watch Program (Table ES-6). These elevated concentrations probably are natural and attributable to species differences and to inputs of metal-laden sediments to the Beaufort Sea from river runoff, particularly during the spring breakup (Rember and Trefry, 2004), or upwelling of metal-rich deep water from the Beaufort Sea continental slope. Table ES[long dash]6. Concentration ranges of several metals in fish, mussels, amphipods, and clams collected in the Beaufort Sea between 2000 and 2006 as part of the ANIMIDA and cANIMIDA Programs, compared to the National Status and Trends median concentration ranges for mussels or oysters collected in US coastal waters between 1986 and 2003 (From O'Connor and Lauenstein, 2006). Concentrations are [mu]g/g dry wt (ppm). The coastal marine environment of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea is nutrient-poor with relatively short near-shore and offshore food webs (Figure ES-1). Crustaceans, including the species monitored in this program, are the most important primary consumers. Crusteacean zooplanton, especially calanoid copepods and euphausiids, are particularly important to top consumers in the local food web. Calanoid copepods and euphausiids are consumed by bowhead whales during their spring and fall migrations through the Beaufort Sea development area. These zooplankton also are consumed by arctic cod, which in turn are a major part of the diet of beluga whales, ringed seals, and several marine bird species. Because zooplankton, particularly large copepods and euphausiids, are so important in the Beaufort Sea food web, they should be collected and analyzed for contaminants in any future monitoring program. Any contaminants released in large amounts from offshore oil and gas activities are likely to bioaccumulate in the local food web and spread through the ecosystem. None of the chemicals monitored in this investigation (petroleum hydrocarbons and several metals), except possibly mercury as methylmercury, biomagnify through marine food webs (Neff, 2002a,b); therefore, concentrations of metals and hydrocarbons are not likely to be high in tissues of top consumers, such as whales, seals, and polar bears. This study has shown that oil development activities in the Beaufort Sea are not contributing ecologically significant amounts of petroleum hydrocarbons and metals to the near-shore marine food web of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. Mean TPAH concentrations in fish, deployed mussels, amphipods, isopods, mysids, and clams collected from all stations in 2004, 2005, and 2006, as well as fish collected in 2001 and amphipods, clams, and deployed mussels collected in 2000 and 2002 in the ANIMIDA Program, ranged from 9.44 ng/g dry wt to 157 ng/g (parts per billion) (Tables ES-1 and ES-2). By comparison, the median concentration of TPAH in tissues of mussels and oysters collected in coastal waters of the United States in 2002/2003 and analyzed in the National Status and Trends Mussel Watch Program was 220 ng/g dry wt (O'Connor and Lauenstein, 2006). The lowest concentration of TPAH measured in mussels and oysters in the Mussel Watch Program was 7.3 ng/g. Thus, invertebrates and fish from the Beaufort Sea contain low concentrations of TPAH, compared to mussels and oysters (the greatest bioaccumulators) from the other US states. The PAH profiles in tissues of fish and invertebrates from the Beaufort Sea is consistent with a mixed petrogenic/pyrogenic source; petrogenic PAH probably are derived from aerial deposition, oil and gas operations in the vicinity, and runoff from land (Steinhauer and Boehm, 1992). TPAH concentrations were not higher in tissues of marine animals from the vicinity of the Northstar Development, the only facility that produced crude oil from Federal waters of the Beaufort Sea, than in the same species from other locations. The concentrations of individual and total PAH in tissues of Beaufort Sea marine animals are well below concentrations that would represent a health risk to marine animals and the animals, including man, that might consume them (Neff, 2002a). Concentrations of 18 metals in tissues of several species of fish, amphipods, isopods, clams, and deployed mussels collected in the Northstar development and the Liberty prospect areas and in other reference areas were similar in 2004, 2005, and 2006 (Tables ES-3 and ES-4). A few metals concentrations were slightly higher in marine animals from Northstar than in the same species from the other sampling sites; however, there were no consistent metal, year, or species patterns.

We assessed coral recruitment on platforms possessing adult corals around the FGB. In this preliminary experiment, we used terra cotta plates mounted on racks, deployed on six platforms at depths of 15-27 m for a duration of <= 1 yr in two consecutive years. Data on coral spat taxonomic identification, distribution, and densities were collected. Platform spat densities on plates averaged <1/450 cm(2), a low value when compared with the East-FGB (E-FGB; data from earlier similar experiment), other Caribbean sites, or the Great Barrier Reef. Spat density was not significantly different between platforms, suggesting that distance between the platforms and the E-FGB, a potential larval source, was large enough (>0.6-1.2 km) to permit extensive larval diffusion. Total spat density also did not vary significantly between settlement racks, indicating that settlement at the spatial scale of meters was relatively homogeneous. Only three species of spat were found-Tubastraea coccinea, Madracis decactis, and Montastraea sp.; the taxonomic composition of coral spat varied from those observed earlier on the E-FGB-Agaricia and Porites. The dominant recruits matched the dominant adults on the platforms an unusual situation. Tubastraea and Madracis spat densities, respectively, did not vary significantly between platforms or between racks. Because of low recruitment levels, these artificial reef communities may be considered fragile in comparison to many natural ones because of the time required for recovery in the event of a mass coral mortality. These low recruitment levels, however, when integrated over similar to 30 yr, can result in the successful establishment of adult coral communities on the platforms.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,1087-688X,,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium, LUMCON, 8124 Highway 56, Chauvin, LA 70344 USA",,,,2015-06-24,BCI:BCI201500468999,,

Predicting how this transition affects ecosystem functioning is difficult because little is known about pond biogeochemistry. We characterized sediment organic matter sources and transformations in three ponds with different plant communities, over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, using a combination of stable isotopes, lipid biomarkers, and benthic fluxes. Sediment respiration rates (1.66 +/- 0.09 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) to 28.53 +/- 7.76 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) were comparable to shallow estuaries and driven by sulfate reduction. Rates varied across ponds, reflecting differences in summertime Ruppia maritima and macroalgae abundances, but were similar between seasons. Interactions between above-ground plant and sediment bacterial communities translated into distinct biogeochemical processes across the three ponds. Tidal isolation and summer weather intensified plant and bacterial community effects on pond carbon dynamics, resulting in algal biomass and lipid delta C-13 values that were 3-12 parts per thousand enriched, compared to nearby habitats. Surface sediment organic matter mainly derived from pond microalgae and was compositionally distinct from tidal creeks and marshes. Surprisingly, sediment bacteria were not tightly coupled to benthic microalgae but decomposed multiple carbon sources in surface sediments and became increasingly reliant on buried peat at deeper horizons. Pond development over time could largely be explained by sediment respiration and the simultaneous accretion of the surrounding marsh platform. The role of decomposition in pond expansion is consistent with previous assessments based on whole-pond metabolism rates. Consequently, future pond expansion could alter ecosystem biogeochemistry and reduce carbon storage.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,6,0,12,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,,,,,,,"Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Marine Chem & Geochem Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",,,,2018-08-20,WOS:000440928800012,,

A comparison of three different larval densities (low, middle, and high) indicated that the number of settlers was proportional to the larval density, suggesting that settler density is determined by the number of larvae supplied. However, the survival rate of settlers on high-density plates was much lower than the corresponding rates on low- or middle-density plates during the first month after settlement.

Under US law, federal and state governments have joint responsibility for facilitating restoration to compensate quantitatively for ecosystem services lost because of oil spills and other contaminant releases on tidal marshes. This responsibility is now met by choosing and employing metrics (proxies) for the suite of ecosystem services to quantify injury and scale restoration accordingly. Most injury assessments in tidal marshes are triggered by oil spills and are limited to: (1) documenting areas covered by heavy, moderate and light oiling; (2) estimating immediate above-ground production toss (based on stem density and height) of the dominant vascular plants within each oiling intensity category and (3) sampling sediments for chemical analyses and depth of contamination, followed by sediment toxicity assays if sediment contamination is high and likely to persist. The percentage of immediate loss of ecosystem services is then estimated along with the recovery trajectory. Here, we review potential metrics that might refine or replace present metrics for marsh injury assessment. Stratifying plant sampling by the more productive marsh edge versus the less accessible interior would improve resolution of injury and provide greater confidence that restoration is truly compensatory. Using microphytobenthos abundance, cotton-strip decomposition bioassays and other biogeochemical indicators, or sum of production across consumer trophic levels faits as a stand-alone substitute metric. Below-ground plant biomass holds promise as a potential proxy for resiliency but requires further testing. Under some conditions, like chronic contamination by organic pollutants that affect animals but not vascular plants, benthic infaunal density, toxicity testing, and tissue contamination, growth, reproduction and mortality of marsh vertebrates deserve inclusion in the assessment protocol. Additional metrics are sometimes justified to assay microphytobenthos, use by nekton, food and habitat for reptiles, birds and mammals, or support of plant diversity. Empirical research on recovery trajectories in previously injured marshes could reduce the largest source of uncertainty in quantifying cumulative service losses.",,,,,,,,,23,1,0,0,20,0,33,,,0065-2881,2162-5875,978-0-12-374351-0,,,,,,,,,"Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USARutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, Marine Field Stn, Tuckerton, NJ 08087 USAUniv Wisconsin, Arboretum & Bot Dept, Madison, WI 53711 USAUniv Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000261529600004,18929066,

For offshore activities this water is usually discharged to the marine environment. Produced water contains traces of hydrocarbons such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well as alkylphenols, which are relatively resistant to biodegradation and have been reported to cause adverse effects to marine organisms in laboratory studies. For management of produced water, risk-based tools have been developed using toxicity data for mainly non-Arctic species. Reliable risk assessment approaches for Arctic environments are requested to manage potential impacts of produced water associated with increased oil and gas activities in Arctic regions. In order to assess the applicability of existing risk tools for Arctic areas, basic knowledge on the sensitivity of Arctic species has to be developed. In the present study, acute and chronic toxicity of artificial produced water for 6 Arctic and 6 temperate species was experimentally tested and evaluated. The hazardous concentrations affecting 5% and 50% of the species were calculated from species sensitivity distribution curves. Hazardous concentrations were compared to elucidate whether temperate toxicity data used in risk assessment are sufficiently representative for Arctic species. From the study it can be concluded that hazardous concentration derived from individual species' toxicity data of temperate and Arctic species are comparable. However, the manner in which Arctic and non-Arctic populations and communities respond to exposure levels above established thresholds remains to be investigated. Hence, responses at higher levels of biological organization should be studied to reveal potential differences in sensitivities to produced water between Arctic and non-Arctic ecosystems.

REEFS can contribute to shore protection because it originates storm waves breaking like natural reefs do. Due to its stay vanes and variable porosity enveloping surface the REEFS WEC creates an inner sea water flow that drives a low head turbine located inside the device.

High-frequency parallel measurements from two instruments placed within 1 m from each other, relocation of one of the instruments at the release site and 2D horizontal mapping of the release and control sites confirmed a localized impact from CO2 emissions.

This is particularly the case when testing for the effects of barotrauma, where the incision for an internal tag would inadvertently vent the fish, precluding an unvented or control treatment. The rise of barotrauma experimentation has increased the need for methods facilitating this design. Here, we develop and test a novel technique to externally attach acoustic tags, without causing the release of gasses from the fish's body cavity. In addition, this method does not require anesthetics, thereby allowing researchers to eliminate artifacts associated with sedation when trying to more accurately replicate real-world fishery conditions. We used accelerometer/depth tags to provide information on how long an externally tagged fish would retain its tag in situ. Changes in acceleration or changes in depth were used as a proxy to determine whether the fish was alive or dead or had shed its tag. Results showed that 80% of the fish (n = 20) detected retained their tags for at least 48 h. Seventy-five percent of the fish tagged retained their tags for at least 23 d. After 23 d, tags were shed periodically until day 49. Thirty-three percent of fish tagged retained their tags until day 57, when the experiment was ended. The ability of these modified tags to stay attached for at least 23 d suggests that the technique would be successful for maintaining a balanced experimental design for measuring postrelease mortality or changes in behavior in deepwater fishes while eliminating artifacts typically associated with internal tag implantation.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,10,0,13,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USATexas Tech Univ, Dept Biol, Lubbock, TX 79409 USAUniv Western Sydney, Sch Sci & Hlth, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia",,,,2015-08-26,WOS:000358854700017,,

The parts of the pipeline and seafloor surveyed were situated in waters 95-235 m deep. Some sections of the surveyed pipe were covered with both sessile and motile invertebrates, such as sea anemones (Metridium cf. farcimen) and sea urchins (Allocentrotus fragilis), sea stars (particularly Hippasteria cf. spinosa and Stylasterias cf. forreri), basket stars (Gorgonocephalus eucnemis), spot prawns (Pandalus platyceros), and king crabs (Paralithodes californiensis). Based on differences in fish assemblages, four habitats (shallow and deep pipeline and shallow and deep seafloor) were categorized. Fish densities along the shallow portion of the pipeline were about seven times higher than on the adjacent seafloor and densities along the deep pipeline portion were nearly six times that of the deeper seafloor. Along the pipeline, rockfishes comprised 84% of the fishes and included 22 species. Unidentified sanddabs (probably most or all Citharichthys sordidus), forming 33.2%, and combfishes (Zaniolepis frenata and Z. latipinnis), comprising 19% of the total, were most often observed on the seafloor. Most of the fishes living on the pipeline were either juveniles of such larger taxa as blackgill (Sebastes melanostomus), flag (S. rubrivinctus), and vermilion (S. miniatus) rockfishes, cowcod (S. levis), and lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), or diminutive species such as halfbanded (S. semicinctus) and stripetail (S. saxicola) rockfishes, combfishes (Zaniolepis spp.), and poachers (Family Agonidae). Higher densities of fishes were often noted in areas of the pipeline that had been undercut. Of particular interest were the relatively high densities of juvenile cowcod along the deeper parts of the pipeline, densities that were far higher than any seen at over 80 natural outcrops and at ten platforms.

To determine if petroleum hydrocarbons from offshore oil operations are entering the Beaufort Sea food web, we measured concentrations of hydrocarbons in tissues of amphipods, Anonyx nugax, sediments, Northstar crude oil, and coastal peat, collected between 1999 and 2006 throughout the development area. Mean concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), saturated hydrocarbons (SHC), and sterane and triterpane petroleum biomarkers (StTr) were not significantly different in amphipods near the Northstar oil production facility, before and after it came on line in 2001, and in amphipods from elsewhere in the study area. Forensic analysis of the profiles (relative composition and concentrations) of the 3 hydrocarbon classes revealed that hydrocarbon compositions were different in amphipods, surface sediments where the amphipods were collected, Northstar crude oil, and peat from the deltas of 4 North Slope rivers. Amphipods and sediments contained a mixture of petrogenic, pyrogenic, and biogenic PAH. The SHC in amphipods were dominated by pristane derived from zooplankton, indicating that the SHC were primarily from the amphipod diet of zooplankton detritus. The petroleum biomarker StTr profiles did not resemble those in Northstar crude oil. The forensic analysis revealed that hydrocarbons in amphipod tissues were not from oil production at Northstar. Hydrocarbons in amphipod tissues were primarily from their diet and from river runoff and coastal erosion of natural diagenic and fossil terrestrial materials, including seep oils, kerogens, and peat. Offshore oil and gas exploration and development do not appear to be causing an increase in petroleum hydrocarbon contamination of the Beaufort Sea food web.

Seagrass ecosystems play a multi-functional role in human well-being, e. g. food through fisheries, control of erosion and protection against floods. Quantifying these services reveals their contributions to human well-being and helps justify seagrass conservation. There has been no comprehensive assessment as to whether seagrass ecosystem services are perceived to vary over the globe or amongst genera. Our study compiles the most complete list of ecosystem services provided by seagrasses so far, including bioregional-and genus-specific information from expert opinion and published studies. Several seagrass ecosystem services vary considerably in their (known) provision across genera and over the globe. Seagrasses genera are clearly not all equal with regard to the ecosystem services they provide. As seagrass genera are not evenly distributed over all bioregions, the presence of an ecosystem service sometimes depends on the genera present. Larger sized seagrass genera (e. g. Posidonia, Enhalus) are perceived to provide more substantial and a wider variety of ecosystem services than smaller species (e. g. Halophila, Lepilaena).

J,,,,,,,,,"Pawlik, Joseph",,Chemical ecology of sponges on Caribbean coral reefs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Aug 15 2010,2010,"Sponges are now the dominant habitat-forming animals on most Caribbean coral reefs. Unlike corals and some macroalgae, sponges have uncalcified skeletons, and are less prone to effects of ocean acidification. A recently published demographic study of the giant barrel sponge on the Florida Keys reefs showed population increases by ~40% between 2000 and 2006. This renewal project would investigate the chemical ecology of Caribbean reef sponges, a group whose taxonomy and secondary metabolites are well described. Some reef sponges produce chemical defenses, while others are subject to grazing by fish predators. The collective community is found over a large biogeographic area where variable anthropogenic impacts permit the testing of fundamental hypotheses about ecosystem function, indirect effects, and resource allocation. Intellectual merits: Previous NSF-funded research has transformed understanding of Caribbean coral reef ecosystems. A survey of chemical, structural and nutritional anti-predatory defenses of over 70 species of Caribbean sponges, followed by field experiments using natural populations of reef fishes, resulted in the isolation and identification of deterrent compounds from over 15 species. A series of manipulative experiments clearly demonstrated that sponge-eating fishes limit sponge distributions, and that parrotfishes are major spongivores, thereby overturning conventional ideas about effects of sponge-eating fishes on reef communities. Novel gel-based assays revealed differential allelopathic effects of sponge metabolites against other sponge and coral species. The ecosystem model for Caribbean reefs thus involves trophic and competitive interactions, predicting cascades and indirect effects known for other ecosystems. Three primary objectives for testing the ecosystem model are to: (1) extend studies of top-down control of the sponge community. Guided by the World Resources Institute Reefs at Risk database, predictions and comparisons will be made of the community structure of sponges and their predators on overfished vs. well-protected reefs across sub-regions of the Caribbean. Parrotfish predation on sponges will be video recorded during food choice experiments on differently impacted reefs. Studies of allelopathic competitive interactions between sponges and corals (sponge metabolites on coral photosynthesis and bleaching) will continue using a modified gel-based field assay and diving-PAM fluorometry; (2) improve testing of the alternative hypothesis that bottom-up processes -- availability of picoplankton as food -- control reef communities. Predator-exclusion experiments will decouple effects of predation from sponge growth at picoplankton-rich and -poor, deep- and shallow-reef sites; (3) expand studies of sponge life history trade-offs in resource allocation between chemical defense, growth and reproduction. Differences in recruitment and succession will be examined among sponge communities of known age on artificial reef surfaces. This component builds on the recent discovery of sponge community succession on the deck of the Spiegel Grove shipwreck off Key Largo, FL, which strongly suggests a resource trade-off between chemical defenses and reproduction or growth. Broader impacts: Renewal of this research program will provide (1) support and training for undergraduate and graduate students at a teaching-intensive, predominantly MS-level university (>68% of direct costs for student support), (2) collaboration between scientists and students from the US and abroad on three 2-week research cruises, (3) web-based outreach, including updated links on the demographics, bleaching, and chemical defenses of Caribbean sponges and further refinement of an easy-to-use photographic key to sponges of the Caribbean. Results of this project will be useful in judging the general applicability of chemical defense theories derived from studies of terrestrial ecosystems, while advancing understanding of the complex relationships between benthic invertebrates, their predators and their competitors in coral reef environments where the effects of global climate change and ocean acidification may be tipping the competitive balance toward non-calcifying organisms, such as sponges.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1029515,,,,,,,,University of North Carolina at Wilmington,University of North Carolina at Wilmington,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14058100,,

The success of the 'rigs to reefs' programme in the Gulf of Mexico has generated some interest in adopting a similar policy on some scale in the North Sea. How this may be achieved following OSPAR 98/3 is reviewed. Studies on the aggregations of fish species have estimated that less than 1.3% of North Sea saithe stocks and less than 0.25% of North Sea cod stocks are associated with oil and gas structures. There is evidence to suggest that fish associated with platforms grow and taste better than off-platform fish, even though very small elevations in hydrocarbon contamination have been detected. Whole ecosystem-based modelling approaches to fishery management indicate that total protection or regeneration of stocks is achieved only through significant area closures to the fishery. The present area closed to the fishery is already maintaining the North Sea fishery status quo. Converting existing structures into offshore reefs is considered unlikely to increase the present area of fishery exclusion nor improve its productivity, even if it was possible under OSPAR 98/3. There has been some speculation of a reef-dominated exclusion zone, whereby the reefs act as a central attractive feature. Bringing the structures inshore for reef construction may have localised positive socio-economic impacts for coastal communities, but achieves no financial benefit for the production industries and does not remove any long-term liability. Without significant levels of state support, both in the fields of construction and liability replacement, a programme of converting rigs into reefs will be difficult to achieve in the context of the North Sea.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,8,0,14,,,0141-0814,,,,,,,,,,,"Dunstaffnage Marine Res Lab, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, ScotlandHeriot Watt Univ, Int Ctr Isl Technol, Stromness KW16 3AW, Orkney, Scotland",,,,2002-06-01,WOS:000223079800009,,

The samples were collected from Phuket province, Thailand, in the high density monospecific patches of different size species (Enhalus acoroides as a big, Thalassia hemprhicii as a medium and Halophila ovalis as a small size species). Total carbon and carbon stored in above and below ground, was significantly different between the species (p<0.05), with the highest values in below ground parts of E. acoroides and T. hemprichii 238.10 +/- 85.07 and 134 +/- 21.55 g Dw m(-2), respectively.

The results of this preliminary research propose that big size species have higher carbon content than smaller species, which reflects in higher sequestration rates of carbon from the ocean, thus reducing the ocean carbon budget.

Currently there is a demand for CCS of large quantities of CO2 associated with CH4 in the pre-salt offshore oil fields in Brazil. The pre-salt reservoirs have as caprock 2000 m of continuous rock salt. This hybrid system is expected to perform, at the same time, the separation between the natural gas and CO2, and Carbon Capture and Storage of CO2, allowing the monetization of the separated natural gas. The Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) approach is discussed in this paper for estimating the maturity of the CCS System. The TRL analysis concluded that no technological gaps were identified that would made the project unfeasible and the TRL level enables the project to advance to the field test stage within a reasonably short time horizon. Once implemented it could be one of the largest CCS projects in the world.

This includes detecting and characterizing: (1) sounds produced and used by living marine resources (e.g., endangered marine mammals); (2) natural sources of noise from physical oceanographic processes; and (3) anthropogenic noise sources that contribute to the overall ocean noise environment. Noise generated by anthropogenic activities (especially commercial shipping and seismic oil & gas exploration) is increasingly being recognized as a potential threat to marine mammals which are protected in the U.S. by the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. Current scientific data suggest that increased ambient noise levels impact marine mammals by hindering communication (Hatch et al. 2012), altering communication behavior (Parks et al. 2013), altering locomotive behavior (Pirotta et al. 2013), and inducing stress (Rolland et al. 2012). Additional concerns associated with the degraded acoustic quality of diverse habitats broaden these concerns to include possible repercussions for fish and invertebrate species, many of which NOAA manages as commercially-harvested, protects as resources within sanctuaries, or studies as key elements to sustaining healthy ecosystems. For these reasons it is important for science-based regulatory agencies including NOAA to monitor long-term trends and changes in the ambient sound field. The objective of the proposed project is to establish a network of initially ten ocean noise reference stations in U.S. waters to monitor long-term changes and trends in the underwater ambient sound field (McDonald et al. 2006). Our plan is to deploy identical autonomous acoustic recording systems developed in-house at PMEL at each reference station to ensure proper calibration and consistency of the collected data sets.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-08,DRCI:DATA2020034018159711,,

Papers in this section examine the development of vegetation, soil properties, invertebrate fauna, and nekton communities in restored coastal marshes and provide a conceptual framework for applying these findings to quantify the benefits associated with compensatory marsh restoration. Extensive meta-analysis of existing data for Gulf of Mexico coastal habitats further confirms that structured habitats such as marsh, submerged aquatic vegetation, and oyster reefs support greater nekton densities than nonvegetated bottom habitat, with oyster reefs supporting different species assemblages than marsh and submerged aquatic vegetation. Other papers demonstrate that while vegetation cover can establish rapidly within the first 5 years of restoration, belowground parameters such as root biomass and soil organic matter remain 44% to 92% lower at restored marshes than reference marshes 15 years after restoration. On average, amphipod and nekton densities are also not fully restored until at least 20 and 13 years following restoration, respectively.

The most of them (20) were circumscribed in 1972 as the appenages of terrestrial reserves and were lacking of detailed scientific information, environmental background, demarcation and sustainable protection. This status cannot assure the conservation of biological and seascape diversity because of (1) fragmentation and small sizes of MPAs, (2) high environmental stress, (3) low level of protection, (4) inferiority of management, (5) imbalance of scientific needs and available research base, (6) excessive touristic and recreational activities, and (7) lack of professional and public awareness of the national and global actions needed to make effective MPA. The problems of MPAs in the Crimean coastal waters were reported in the governmental and NGO conservation programs. These documents contain some positive aspects concerning identification and inclusion of new protected sites into the natural reserve system, conservation and reconstruction of coastal and marine ecosystems, limitation of economic and commercial activity in critical habitats, identification and allocation of priority areas, etc., but they do not concern the creation and management of effective real MPAs. This situation needs prompt conservation-oriented actions directed for the Crimean coastal zone. The most important principles of MPA conservation strategy are(1) MPA should expand to the entire coastal region (ecosystem-based management) rather than be a system of new protected small seascapes or enclaves. (2) The creation of integrated management unit consolidating various forms and levels of marine environment conservation. The establishment of integrated MPA (Biosphere Reserve or Natural Park) in the Crimea coastal zone is the most preferable variant of new structure combining the various levels of protection: no-take cores (centres, units) including existing (enlarged) and new protected sites, rock islands, etc.; buffer protected zones (limited economic, educational and touristic activity), and human-affected habitats (settlements, objects of boat traffic, fishery, diving, tourism). Network or system of MPAs including a wide circle of marine habitats can be an alternative (or parallel) to this structure. This approach is widely accepted throughout the world. It includes bubble concept in extensive sea area, efficiency of environmental management, integrity control of ecosystems and habitat conservation, as well as guarantee of sustainable using of marine resources. Besides the network allocates key areas for migratory and transboundary species, and substantive linkage of activity between marine and continental nature conservation structures. (3) Recommendations need to have a workable solution: e.g., creation of new MPAs is desirable out of sea areas which are involved in economical activities (intensive industry, oil and gas recovery, commercial fishery); vice versa, preservation of wildlife, untouched ecosystems, remoteness from settlements and poor development of recreation are the favourable factors. (4) Integrated environmental approach should be applied for MPA creation: ecosystems, communities, populations, habitats and migration routes (but not only rare, endangered or endemic species) are priorities. (5) The conservation of biological and genetic diversity (including non-commercial and non-target species), and ecosystem productivity; prevention of habitat destruction and disturbance, overfishing and incidental by-catch are necessary. (6) The conservation program for Crimean rivers (including the pollution regulation) is the guarantee of MPAs existence.

Overall, the cobble community had higher diversity and abundance than the reef community. In both communities, diversity and abundance of non-Dreissena taxa rose sharply between 1983 and 1991 to 1992 and declined to 1983 levels by 1999 to 2000. However, taxonomic composition (excluding Dreissena and the recent invader Echinogammarus ischnus) was consistent across study years. Between 1983 and 1999 to 2000, Stagnicola catascopium and Physella spp. increased in abundance, several taxa (Musculium partumeium, Bithynia tentaculata, Elimia livescens, Trichoptera, and Chironomidae) decreased in abundance, and changes in the abundance of many taxa were correlated with Dreissena abundance. Dreissena continued to make up >40% of total macroinvertebrate abundance at the cobble site and >60%, at the reef site in 1999 to 2000, however, numbers dropped sharply and the size of individual mussels increased as D. bugensis largely replaced D. polymorpha between 1991 to 1992 and 1999 to 2000. Dreissena biomass dropped sharply at the reef site between 1991 to 1992 and 1999 to 2000, but not at the cobble site. The exotic amphipod E. ischnus was abundant in 1999 to 2000, but any effect on the abundance of the related amphipod Gammarus fasciatus was unclear. At the time of this study, the round goby Neogobius melanostomus was not present. We conclude that the transition from D. polymorpha to D. bugensis and processes associated with the ongoing oligotrophication of Lake Ontario are responsible for reduced density of larger-bodied Dreissena in the nearshore region, and that changes in the Dreissena population are largely responsible for changes in the non-Dreissena benthic macroinvertebrate communities.",,,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,33,0,41,,,0887-3593,,,,,,,,,,,"SUNY Coll Brockport, Dept Environm Sci & Biol, Brockport, NY 14420 USACornell Univ, Biometr Dept, Ithaca, NY 14803 USASyracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",,,,2005-03-01,WOS:000227149900011,,

It is the only gadfly petrel currently known to breed in the Caribbean Basin. Now seriously endangered, the species is presumed extirpated from Martinique, Dominica, and Guadeloupe, and breeding populations currently occur only on Hispaniola and perhaps Cuba. A related form (now considered a full species) once bred, but is now apparently extinct, on Jamaica. The Black-capped Petrel breeding population may number as few as 500 breeding pairs. Remaining populations suffer from multiple threats to terrestrial and pelagic habitats, including harvest by humans and predation by introduced mammals. The exact sizes, locations, and detailed chronologies of all Black-capped Petrel breeding sites remain poorly studied, although major colonies are today apparently restricted to steep sea and inland cliffs along the La Selle Ridge in Hispaniola. The largest known breeding population occurs in Haiti, although there is continued discussion about a possible breeding site in Cuba in the Sierra Maestra mountain range. Accounts from Cuba are based on the unverified assumption that birds observed at sea just offshore of that island are breeding locally. All evidence at present indicates that waters in or adjacent to the Florida Current and the Gulf Stream between north Florida and southern Virginia provide the primary foraging range of Black-capped Petrels. A small foraging area just off of southeast Cuba has also been reported, but the extent and seasonal use of this area are unknown. Concentrations of birds can be found along the Gulf Stream in southeastern US waters throughout the year, but are particularly common in May, August, and late December through early January. Concentrations of adult birds during winter, when peak breeding activity is underway, suggest that breeding birds forage along the Gulf Stream while commuting to and from breeding colonies. Such long-distance foraging is certainly possible for Pterodroma species. Potential threats to Black-capped Petrels include introduced predators, human encroachment on breeding and foraging habitats, and offshore oil, gas, and wind energy development. Increased mercury levels associated with petroleum production also pose a potential threat, as the Black-capped Petrel seems to be highly susceptible to mercury bioaccumulation compared with other pelagic species. In addition, fires and other bright light sources are known to attract Black-capped Petrels, making collisions with wires and other structures on lighted ships and platforms a potential concern. Haitian social-economic instability and increasing habitat loss suggest the likelihood of further population declines and increasing vulnerability of the species to extinction. Our findings are in accord with the recent decision by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to evaluate the need for additional protection of the species and the primary foraging habitat off the southeastern United States under the Endangered Species Act (USFWS 2012). Additional conservation measures and research strategies that warrant further consideration include (1) protection, monitoring, and management of known breeding populations and nesting habitat in the Dominican Republic and Haiti through controlling predators, installing artificial nest burrows in appropriate sites and hiring local wardens at breeding sites during the nesting season; (2) local and regional training, education and public awareness (e.g. Blanchard & Nettleship 1992); (3) restoration of the original common name Diablotin to common usage to promote the historical and cultural importance of this species; (4) studies to determine the distribution and genetic variability in the remaining populations; and (5) studies of satellite-tagged birds to assess their seasonal and geographic use of pelagic habitats.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1018-3337,,,,,,,,,,,"N Carolina State Univ, NC Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Unit, Raleigh, NC, 27695, USA",,,,2013-04-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15205029386,,

Factors such as oil biodegradation, ocean currents and response measures (dispersants, burning) reduced coastal oiling. Still, >2100 km of shoreline and many coastal habitats were affected. Research demonstrates that oiling caused a wide range of biological effects, although worst-case impact scenarios did not materialize. Biomarkers in individual organisms were more informative about oiling stress than population and community indices. Salt marshes and seabird populations were hard hit, but were also quite resilient to oiling effects. Monitoring demonstrated little contamination of seafood. Certain impacts are still understudied, such as effects on seagrass communities. Concerns of long-term impacts remain for large fish species, deep-sea corals, sea turtles and cetaceans. These species and their habitats should continue to receive attention (monitoring and research) for years to come. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Typically the seabed in deep water comprises soft, lightly overconsolidated, fine grained sediments, which must support a variety of infrastructure placed on the seabed or anchored to it. A particular challenge is often the mobility of the infrastructure either during installation or during operation, and the consequent disturbance and healing of the seabed soil, leading to changes in seabed topography and strength. Novel aspects of geotechnical engineering for offshore facilities in these conditions are reviewed, including: new equipment and techniques to characterise the seabed; yield function approaches to evaluate the capacity of shallow skirted foundations; novel anchoring systems for moored floating facilities; pipeline and steel catenary riser interaction with the seabed; and submarine slides and their impact on infrastructure.

With computers increasing their capabilities of processing, and new complex beam forming algorithms the acoustic signals returned now have excellent ranges and spatial resolutions. The possibility to digitally process these acoustic signals have allowed several other innovations such as the integration of various research methodologies into a single product and expanded the marine environment research possibilities by using the same mechanical and electronic sensor construction. The signals collected by multibeam echo sounders now allow identifying the facies analysis of the seabed, oceanographic features in the water column and even improvements in the sub-bottom profiler's performance. The hydrographic survey vessel FSSV Fugro Brasilis, provides a great case study of these echo sounders capabilities. With modern sensors, mounted in a gondola, 1 meter below the keel, away from the turbulence, aeration and laminar flow, minimizing noise and allowing the processing of low intensity return signals, this vessel exemplifies the installation of a complete system for technological hydrographic surveys down to 7.000m. The arrangement includes two multibeam echo sounders, a Kongsberg EM2040 for shallow water and an EM302 for deep waters, and also a sub-bottom profiler SBP300 sharing the multibeam reception transducers in order to observe the seabed sediment layers with maximum contrast and reflectivity. Part of the development and results evolution obtained passes through the data processing techniques applied to digital signals, which in this case use the processing software Fugro Starfix and Caris. Commercial programs like Caris HIPS & SIPS, make a more pragmatic approach. Naturally, they are in constant contact with the manufacturers from the most commercial relevant equipment and stay up to date in the digital signal processing techniques. Due to this monitoring of the new technologies, Caris HIPS & SIPS are the most suitable software for processing the water column and backscatter data. With the advance of technology, the number of products increases, not only restricted to the accurate achievement of bathymetry, but also enabling the integration of different techniques in order to provide more information in a single product. One of the ways found to increase the investigations quality at sea is processing of the water column data integrated with the bathymetry. This technique enables the research of outline structures in the ocean environment, such as hot springs and gas exudation.

The OSV industry has not been studied significantly and the economic and ecological impacts to local communities is generally unknown. This paper aims to address these issues.Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, the authors review the activities and logistical requirements involved in offshore exploration and development with special attention paid to workflows and the manner in which service vessels are utilized in the Gulf of Mexico. The authors estimate the OSV needs per stage of activity for offshore operations based on data collected from company planning documents, fleet utilization data from oil and gas companies and service providers, interviews and surveys. The statistical data is synthesized and reconciled and despite large variances the data sources are in reasonable agreement. Empirical data on circuit factors are also provided. The applications and limitations of the analyses are discussed.Findings - In the US GOM, a large variety of marine vessels transport goods and provide services to exploration, development and production activity. OSVs provide a vital link between offshore E&P activities and shore-based facilities. Offshore oil and gas operations cannot function without them and their utilization and spatial distribution provide a way of understanding the impacts of the offshore oil and gas industry on coastal communities.Originality/value - This is the first empirical analysis of any offshore service vessel industry.

Most (67 %) of these studies were associated with monitoring and mitigation relative to offshore oil and gas exploration and development. A compilation of this information has been needed to determine anthropogenic impacts to the species throughout its range in Arctic and subarctic waters, including facts for required environmental impact assessment determinations. As a part of the Bowhead Whale Feeding Ecology Study (BOWFEST) conducted by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center's, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML) for the Minerals Management Service (MMS) (now called Bureau of Ocean Energy Management [(BOEM) 1 ), a comprehensive review and compilation was undertaken of all prominent scientific surveys that systematically recorded bowhead whales in the U.S. Beaufort and Chukchi seas from 1975 to 2008 (and some from early 2009). Given the cumulative number of such studies and the predicted continued growth of industrial activities in this region, our goals were to provide: (1) a summary for historical comparisons; (2) a format to integrate and track the studies; and (3) a publicly available starting point to identify data of relevance to ongoing work. To address these goals, we compiled a list synthesizing past and ongoing systematic sighting/acoustic detection studies on bowheads. This compilation included data derived from aerial surveys for whale distribution, aerial photography, ice- and shore-based census efforts, vessel-based and tagging efforts, and monitoring associated with offshore oil and gas exploration, development, and operations. This information is directly relevant to fulfilling the goals of current inter-disciplinary efforts to study bowhead ecology (e.g., BOEM-funded studies such as BOWFEST, Bowhead Whale Aerial Survey Project (BWASP), and Chukchi Offshore Monitoring in Drilling Area (COMIDA)) relative to ongoing, proposed, and anticipated offshore oil and gas activities in BOEM's Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas. Our intent is to provide a comprehensive resource to serve as a foundation for the integration of past and ongoing bowhead studies relative to industrial activities, mitigation, and management. It is also meant to assist and improve the flow of scientific information between interested entities and the public, leading eventually to an integration of research on bowhead whales.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Smultea Environmental Sciences (SES), P.O.

Sedimentation rates (mass accumulation rates) over core depths were calculated based on Pb-210(ex) chronologies, with maximum values of 8.69 kg m(-2).yr(-1), 5.65 kg m(-2).yr(-1) and 8.47 kg m(-2).yr(-1) for Cl, C2 and C3, all appearing at the top layer.

Correlations between increasing sedimentation rates and decreasing sea areas of Dalian Bay after 1980 verified the influence of human activities on the sedimentary processes. The range of ratios on total organic carbon to total nitrogen (TOC/TN) and isotopic composition of carbon (delta C-13) in the sediment was 9.44-17.9 and - 22.81 parts per thousand to - 24.46 parts per thousand respectively. Sedimentary organic carbon (SOC) in Dalian Bay showed characteristics of significant terrestrial input, while also being influenced by marine input. The carbon sequestration potential in Dalian Bay's sediment, based on the sequestration rate of SOC (SR-SOC), showed pronounced increase over time, especially since the 1980s. Primarily driven by sedimentation rate, the carbon sequestration potential was dominated by natural processes before 1980. Since then, it came under significant influence from human activities, and this trend grew more intense after the year 2000.

Although the addition of considerable complex steel structure to the environment and the shift of the red snapper fishery to Louisiana and Texas may be coincidental, there is still a need to better understand the role of oil and gas platforms in red snapper life history. Quantitative estimates of red snapper associated with platforms have been derived both from assessments of the effects of platform removal via explosives and from hydroacoustic surveys of selected platforms. Based both on these estimates and on the numbers of platforms sited at depth, we estimate from 1.2 to 7.2 million red snapper live around platforms placed at depths of 20 -100 m. Many of these are relatively young individuals of ages 2 - 4 years. These numbers suggest a range of red snapper abundances reflecting the ubiquitous presence of red snapper at oil and gas platforms.

Hediste diversicolor was therefore exposed to different levels of Ra-226 (30-6600 Bq kg(-1)) in combination with scale inhibitor in the sediments in a flow through system. The levels of radioactivity in the exposures were close to levels that can be measured in proximity to oil/gas production facilities. Ra-226 spiked to natural sediment partitioned into pore water and accumulated in the sediment-dwelling polychaete following a four-week exposure period. The results suggest that 226Ra did not bind strongly to sediment (low sediment:water partitioning coefficient), but it was not shown to bioaccumulate in any great extent (bioaccumulation factors of 0.019-0.022). Exposure of H. diversicolor in sediments with up to 6600 Bq kg(-1) Ra-226 had no measurable effect on the total oxyradical scavenging capacity of the organisms compared to control.

During the Cambrian, platform, slope, and deep sea basin environments were developed in the study area. On the platform, both clastic rocks and carbonate rocks were deposited. Clastic rocks mainly occur in the Lower Cambrian, and were deposited in marine shore and shelf environments. Carbonate rocks are dominant in the Middle and Upper Cambrian, and were deposited in the open platform, restricted platform, tidal flat, beach, and reef environments. Carbonate gravity flow deposits were developed on the slope. In the basin, mainly black shales and chert beds were deposited. The Cambrian represents one large transgression-regression cycle, and maximum transgression occurred in the Qiongzhusi Age of the Early Cambrian. Tectonics and sea level fluctuations had important impacts on sedimentary environments. The Chengkou-Fangxian-Xiangfan Fracture controlled the position of the platform, slope and basin, as well as the silica supply for chert deposition in basin. Sea level fluctuations controlled types of sediments and sedimentary facies on the platform. In the study area, there are good reservoir rocks, including dolomites, grainstones, debris flow deposits, sandstones, and conglomerates; there are good source rocks, including black shales, dark micrites, and chert beds; and there are also good reservoir-source rock assemblages.

The conservation of biological diversity in terrestrial environments has become recognised as requiring conservation of habitats in order to preserve diversity. This concept is particularly applicable in the marine environment, where macroalgae are limited to the photic zone, and usually grow attached to hard substratum. Three of the major threats to marine macroalgae biodiversity are habitat alienation, pollution and the introduction of exotic (alien) species.The development of the coastline, particularly related to increased population pressure in coastal areas, leads to construction, for example, of marinas, port facilities and canal estates. Developments result in direct destruction of existing communities and indirect changes in hydrodynamics and sedimentation. They may produce extra habitat in the form of new surfaces for colonisation, but there is unlikely to be a net gain in habitat.Reduced water quality in association with development, and from point source and diffuse pollution, also results in macroalgal loss. Generally these losses do not lead to complete loss of a taxon, but the extent of human population growth in the coastal zone will continue to increase the impact on algal populations and certainly lead to zones of diversity depletion resulting from multiple, chronic pollution events.A third major threat to macroalgal diversity is that of introduced species. The examples of Sargassum muticum in Europe, and Undaria pinnatifida in France, Australia and New Zealand, suggest species introduction can cause replacement of dominant macroalgae by introduced species resulting in shifts in communities and their trophic food webs.",,,,,Annual Meeting of the Australasian-Society-for-Phycology-and-Aquatic-BotanyAnnual Meeting of the Australasian-Society-for-Phycology-and-Aquatic-Botany,"JAN, 1997JAN, 1997",Australasian Soc Phycol & Aquat BotanyAustralasian Soc Phycol & Aquat Botany,"CSIRO MARINE LABS, HOBART, AUSTRALIACSIRO MARINE LABS, HOBART, AUSTRALIA",92,1,0,0,67,1,102,,,0006-8055,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, Dept Bot, Nedlands, WA 6907, Australia",,,,1998-01-01,WOS:000072103200013,,

Foraminiferal faunas indicate a progressive increase in bathymetry from a brackish shallow marine to a bathyal condition during the Middle Miocene. The basin then came under the spell of volcanism and nearly 1000 in of basalt-basaltic andesite flows accumulated until the top of the volcano emerged out of the sea. After the cessation of volcanic activity, the basin subsided and cold bathyal conditions prevailed in which diatomaceous-siliceous sediment was accumulated during the Late Miocene. The periodic episodes of subsidence are inferred to have been related to the genesis of the Japan Sea. The basin witnessed a major hiatus during the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene. During the Late Pliocene, coarse clastic sediments accumulated in the region in a cold bathyal condition of deposition. The elastic sediment is thought to have derived from the eastern upland where the Upper Cretaceous and Paleogene sedimentary rocks were exposed. It is supposed that the hiatus in the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene is a result of an upheaval of central Hokkaido, which unstabilized the sediment and changed bottom current condition.The Early to Middle Miocene microfauna of the region is similar to those of the Japan Sea region, whereas the Late Miocene fauna is different in abundance of agglutinated foraminifera. Such faunal differences between the study area and Japan Sea region of Honshu in the Late Miocene are mainly due to the variable distances from the proto-Tsugaru Strait that let carbonate-saturated Pacific seawater into the Japan Sea.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,0,5,,,1342-8144,,,,,,,,,,,"Akita 0100834, Japan",,,,2005-12-31,BCI:BCI200600287135,,

Within northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) offshore habitats, higher abundance of tropically associated lane snapper Lutjanus synagris is correlated with rising temperatures. Increased presence of juvenile and adult lane snapper could result in important competitive interactions with nGOM reef fishes, such as economically important red snapper L. campechanus, at multiple life stages and cause shifts in resource utilization and species composition of offshore fish assemblages. We investigated interactions between adult and juvenile lane and red snapper within experimental mesocosms. Although no significant effects on prey consumption were observed, interspecific competition between adults and juveniles was strongest, as adult lane snapper utilized habitats at higher rates than single juvenile red snapper in interaction trials. Additionally, adult red snapper most strongly displaced single juvenile lane snapper and increased their swimming activities in the presence of heterospecific juveniles. Adult red snapper also aggressively chased juvenile lane snapper and displaced them from habitats. However, less pronounced effects were observed for grouped juveniles in the presence of adults, especially juvenile red snapper, while adult lane snapper swam less in the presence of grouped juvenile lane and red snapper. Additionally, single juvenile red snapper swimming activities and prey consumption in the presence of adult snappers did not significantly differ from control values. Therefore, at small scales adult lane snapper may partially displace single juvenile red snapper, but clusters of red and lane snapper juveniles may be resilient to competitive effects of adult lane snapper and exert partial competitive pressures on them. As expected, we found that elevated aggressiveness by larger individuals resulted in dominance in space occupancy in one-on-one interactions. These findings suggest that prior occupation of preferred hard bottom habitat may be a determining factor for grouped juvenile red snapper competing against similar sized or larger individuals. Overall, our results indicate varying competitive vulnerabilities of red snapper to climate-related range expansions of tropical congeners.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USADauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USAECS Fed LLC, NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Off Sci & Technol, 1315 East West Highway,F-ST7, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA",,,,2019-09-30,WOS:000485735400010,,

Release of phosphate from the wreck of a chemical tanker (MV Ece) in the western English Channel (49.73 degrees N, 3.25 degrees W) in March 2006 is used to demonstrate the importance of sustained observations in decision support systems and policy development. The Ferrybox system continuously collects sea surface (5 in) data from a suite of autonomous electronic sensors installed on a passenger ferry operating year-round between Portsmouth (UK) and Bilbao (Spain). The detection of anomalously high concentrations of phosphate (1.54 mmol m(-3), four times the usual level) and onset of phytoplankton growth close to the wreck site in March 2006 was placed in the context of multiple years of measurements (phosphate, nitrate, silicate and chlorophyll) collected from the Ferrybox system (2003-2006) and the long-term time series station El (50.03 degrees N, 4.65 degrees W, 1930-1987) in the English Channel. With regard to decision support, release of phosphate from the tanker is unlikely to pose a threat as phytoplankton growth at the end of winter is not unusual in this region and dissolved inorganic nitrogen rather than phosphate (DIN:DIP = 10-18) is likely to ultimately limit algal growth in spring 2006. With regard to policy development, the Oslo and Paris (OSPAR) commissions recommendation of sampling every three years in non-problem areas is likely to provide statistically inadequate data, given the interannual and decadal variability identified in the Ferrybox and El data: the Ferrybox data show that oceanic winter nutrient concentrations varied by 35-50% between 2003/2004 and 2005/2006 due to deeper mixing of water off-shelf in early 2005/2006 and comparisons between the Ferrybox and El years show that the western English Channel is currently experiencing a low in phosphate concentrations similar to those in the 1960s. The importance of Ferrybox data in evaluating the reliability of predictive operational models needed in decision support is also demonstrated, by highlighting both strengths and weaknesses in a state-of-the-art ecosystem model designed for UK shelf waters.

To investigate these mechanisms, we use benthic B/Ca to reconstruct deep water [CO32-] in cores from the deep Indian and Equatorial Pacific Oceans during the past five glacial cycles. Based on our reconstructions, we suggest that the redistribution of carbonate deposition from shelf areas to the deep ocean raised deep water [CO32] on average by 7.3 0.5 (SE) umol/kg during glaciations. Oceanic carbon reorganizations during major climatic transitions caused deep water [CO32] deviations away from the long-term trend and carbonate compensation processes subsequently acted to restore new steady state conditions. Glacial-interglacial trends in [CO32] are generally in good agreement with records of sediment carbonate contents (%CaCO3), suggesting that seafloor %CaCO3 is dominated by changes in carbonate preservation in deep water at our studied sites.

Lack of a systematic, widely accepted, and balanced approach for measuring the potential damage to wildlife, habitats, and communities continues to leave wind developers, regulators, and other stakeholders in an uncertain position. This paper explores ecological risk-based management (RBM) in wind energy development for land-based and offshore wind installations. This paper provides a framework for the adaptation of ecosystem-based management to wind energy development and examines that framework through a series of case studies and best management practices for applying risk-based principles to wind energy. Ten case studies indicate that wind farm monitoring is often driven by regulatory requirements that may not be underpinned by scientific questions. While each case applies principles of adaptive management, there is room for improvement in applying scientific principles to the data collection and analysis. Challenges and constraints for wind farm development to meet RBM framework criteria include collecting sufficient baseline and monitoring data year-round, engaging stakeholder facilitators, and bringing together large and diverse scientific teams.

However, though effective in isolating mercury species migration into overlying water, capping can also alter the location and extent of biogeochemical zones and potentially enhance methylmercury (MeHg) formation in Hg-contaminated marine sediments. We carried out a boxcosm study to investigate whether the addition of organic carbon (OC) to Hg-contaminated marine sediments beneath an in situ cap would initiate and/or enhance MeHg formation of the inorganic Hg present. The study was motivated by ongoing efforts to remediate ca. 30,000 m(2) of Hg-contaminated seabed sediments from a Hg spill from the U864 WWII submarine wreck. By the time of sinking, the submarine is assumed to have been holding a cargo of ca. 65 tons of liquid Hg. Natural organic matter and petroleum hydrocarbons from fuels and lubricants in the wreck are potential sources of organic carbon that could potentially fuel MeHg formation beneath a future cap. The results of our study clearly demonstrated that introduction of algae OC to Hg-contaminated sediments, triggered high rates of MeHg production as long a there was sufficient OC. Thus, MeHg production was limited by the amount of organic carbon available. The study results also confirmed that, within the six-month duration of the study and in the absence of bioturbating fauna, a 3-cm sediment clay cap could effectively reduce fluxes of Hg species to the overlying water and isolate the Hg-contaminated sediments from direct surficial deposition of organic matter that could potentially fuel methylation.

Therefore, 894 Diplodus sargus were captured and marked with conventional plastic t-bar tags. At the same time, 19 D. sargus were tagged with acoustic transmitters and monitored by 20 automatic acoustic receivers inside the no-take MPA for 60 days. Recapture rate of conventionally tagged specimens was 3.47%, most occurring during subsequent marking campaigns. One individual however was recaptured by recreational fishermen near Faro (ca. 250 km from the tagging location) 6 months after release. Furthermore, three specimens were recaptured in October 2013 near releasing site, one year after being tagged. Regarding acoustic telemetry, 18 specimens were detected by the receivers during most of the study period. To analyse no-take MPA use, the study site was divided into five areas reflecting habitat characteristics, three of which were frequently used by the tagged fish: Exterior, Interior Protected and Interior Exposed areas. Information on no-take protected area use was also analysed according to diel and tidal patterns. Preferred passageways and permanence areas were identified and high site fidelity was confirmed. The interaction between tide and time of day influenced space use patterns, with higher and more variable movements during daytime and neap tides. This no-take MPA proved to be an important refuge and feeding area for this species, encompassing most of the home ranges of tagged specimens. Therefore, it is likely that this no-take MPA is of adequate size to protect D. sargus against fishing activities, thus contributing to its sustainable management in the region.

These platforms provide hard substratum that extends throughout the euphotic zone, in a region where such has been rare in recent geological time. Major exceptions to this are coral reefs of the Flower Garden Banks (FGB), similar to200 km S-SE of Galveston, Texas, USA. We determined whether extensive scleractinian coral populations had colonized these platforms, quantified them, and determined their population and community characteristics. We also examined the relationship between these variables and distance from the FGB, platform age and depth. Surveys were performed on 13 oil or gas production platforms down to 36 m depth, encompassing an ellipse around the FGB. Corals occurred in abundance on most of the platforms. We found 11 species, comprising 8 hermatypic scleractinians, 2 ahermatypic scleractinians and 1 hydrozoan coral. The most abundant corals were Madracis decactis, Diploria strigosa and Tubastraea coccinea. Distance from the FGB was not related to the coral community variables measured, including total coral abundances of the dominant 3 species in shallow water (<14 m), deep water (14 to 36 m), or both depths combined. Total coral abundance increased significantly with increasing platform age, and the community was best developed on platforms >12 to 15 yr old. Abundance of M. decactis increased significantly with increasing platform age in deeper water and both depths combined, as did coral species diversity (S). This was not the case with D. strigosa, indicating that it may not be associated with any particular successional sere. Neither was T coccinea abundance associated with platform age, except in shallow water, where it decreased in abundance with increasing age, indicating that this species may be an opportunistic pioneer species. All corals combined exhibited a significantly non-uniform depth distribution, with total coral abundance peaking at similar to20 and 28 m depths. M. decactis exhibited a similar bimodal depth distribution, with a disproportionately high peak at depths > 27 m. D. strigosa exhibited peaks at similar to10 and 23 m depth and was not found at depths > 27 m. T coccinea exhibited a near-normal distribution, with a mode at similar to17 m depth. Platforms have facilitated the expansion of coral populations in the GOM. Such platforms possess an intrinsic environmental value through the presence of coral populations, and this may influence future decisions regarding their removal.",,,,,,,,,116,7,0,0,104,3,144,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium, Chauvin, LA 70344 USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUS Dept Interiro, Minerals Management Serv, New Orleans, LA 70123 USA",Louisiana Univ Marine ConsortiumUS Dept Interiro,,,2004-01-01,WOS:000225268500011,,

J,,,,,,,,,Jacqueline Tweddle,,A bottom up approach to marine management: Marine phytoplankton as regulators of ecosystem functions and services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Oct 31 2016,2016,"Microscopic marine algae (phytoplankton) are crucially important to climate cycle and marine ecosystem functions, and support a range of ecosystem services (ES). Vital ES carried out by phytoplankton include oxygen production, uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the ocean, and sustaining marine food-webs. Phytoplankton have spatially and temporally distinct distributions, with some locations consistently supporting greater primary production, with subsequent impacts on the distributions of supported ecosystem functions and ES including populations of seabirds, marine mammals and commercial fisheries. However, phytoplankton are given little consideration within marine management, with little use made of research into phytoplankton, and their relationships with other ecosystem functions and ES. This is a major knowledge gap and limits the effectiveness of marine management. This fellowship will address this evidence gap to provide a robust evidence-based framework to aid marine management. I will work closely with Marine Management Organisation (MMO) and bodies with similar functions in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to ensure this evidence base is considered in marine planning and licencing processes. For example, my recent work shows wind farms can cause an up to 30% decrease in annual primary production, but that this can be mitigated through smaller turbine bases or siting turbines out of phytoplankton hotspots.The goal of this fellowship is to facilitate the MMO in achieving sustainable development through ecosystems-based management as supported by robust scientific evidence. Key objectives include analysing and evaluating information (much of it funded by NERC) on the spatial and temporal relationships between phytoplankton and supported ecosystem functions and ES and establishing how this information can be best used to improve the sustainable management of our oceans, contributing to filling MMO evidence gaps. Deliverables include reports for the MMO based on analysis of published results and, primarily, visiting key researchers and research groups, and participating in conferences and working groups - thus actively incorporating the leading edge of research, whilst encouraging researchers to engage with marine managers. Training will be delivered to MMO staff on using the ES concept in marine management and stakeholder engagement, furthering its use by the MMO.I have experience in oceanographic research and marine management, and will use both sets of expertise in this fellowship - using science expertise to collate and synthesise high-quality research, and management expertise to facilitate targeted and strategic communications with the MMO in order to apply cutting-edge science to MMO objectives. This, in combination with extensive time spend at the MMO offices, will ensure that the needs of the MMO are well understood and prioritised, and that scientific evidence is useful and presented accessibly.There is a lack of engagement between researchers in the fellowship topics and marine managers - researchers are unclear how to engage with marine management (e.g. who to contact and how to present information), and management organisations are often unaware of current research. A key objective of this fellowship is therefore to encourage engagement between researchers and the MMO. Deliverables include a workshop to establish best practice for knowledge exchange between scientists and marine managers. I will develop an outreach activity for the MMO, educating researchers on why and how to use their research to support marine management. To facilitate future engagement, beyond the fellowship, I will use my extensive network to generate an Experts in Support of Marine Management (ESMM) database product for the MMO, simplifying locating experts in a topic. This fellowship will build a lasting, productive relationship between the MMO and the biological oceanography community in the UK, and beyond.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/P005756/1,,,,,,,,University of Aberdeen,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15395448,,

Two distinct internal wave regimes were encountered: period I in which large-amplitude high-frequency nonlinear internal waves (NIWs) occurred (around neap tides) and period II in which the internal wave spectral continuum was not dominated by any particular frequency band (around spring tides). Empirical orthogonal function analysis shows that for the low-frequency waves, 76% of the variance was described by mode 1, rising to 95% for the high-frequency waves. During period I the dissipation and vertical mixing were characterized by the NIWs, and 70% of the dissipation occurred in the bottom boundary layer. During period II the depth-integrated dissipation was more evenly distributed throughout the tidal cycle, whereas vertical mixing was greatly enhanced during a single hour long episode of elevated thermocline dissipation coincident with weakened stratification. During both periods I and II similar to 30% of the total measured dissipation occurred within the thermocline when averaged over 12.4 hours; the remainder occurred within the bottom boundary layer(BBL). Tidal average values for depth-integrated dissipation and vertical eddy diffusivity for period I (II) were 1.1 x 10(-2) W m(-2) (4.0 x 10(-2) W m(-2)) and 5 cm(2) s(-1) (12 cm(2) s(-1)), respectively. Decay rates and internal damping are discussed, and vertical heat fluxes are estimated.

Insights from a mathematical approach,,,,,,,,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,,297,,,,98,106,,,,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.10.034,,,,,,,Article,FEB 10 2015,2015,"At the world scale, many exploited species are currently threatened or undermined by human activities, particularly fishing. Given this situation, establishing artificial habitats (AHs) and marine protected areas (MPAs) is seen as away of both conserving biodiversity and managing fishing activities. AHs have two main effects: (1) they attract fish from the surrounding areas and concentrate them in the AH, and (2) they increase the capacity of the environment, as a result of the installation of new individuals or, in some cases, of new species. MPAs decrease fish accessibility by constraining the spatial distribution of the fishing effort. We have developed a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that can be used to describe the evolution of fish density, fishing effort, and landings depending on whether AHs are deployed in a MPA or in a fishing area. The analytical study of the ODE system is simplified by means of assuming that processes occur on different time scales. Fish reproduction and landings were assumed to occur at a slow time scale, whereas, fish displacement was assumed to occur at a fast time scale. For both scenarios of AHs implementation (in an MPA or in a fishing area), we show the existence of different equilibria according to hypotheses based on a purely attractive or purely productive effect of the AH. In all cases, the deployment of AHs in the fishing area leads to an equilibrium with lower fish biomass and lower fish landings than when AHs are deployed within the MPA. This suggests that AHs should not be fished in order to maximize long term fish productivity and fish landings in the surrounding areas. In addition, we attempt to establish a correspondence between our theoretical results and the management plan for artisanal fisheries on the Senegalese coast, which includes the implementation of both AHs and MPAs. This suggests that there is not enough coordination between the non-governmental organizations deploying the AHs and the institutions managing MPAs. Indeed, AHs are usually either immersed in an MPA or subject to local fishing ban, but in fact regulation is inadequate. In this context, the deployment of AHs as part of fisheries management would be premature and could have potentially adverse effects on the resource. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Initial findings suggested that the spill and cleanup depressed abundances of all taxonomic groups. By 1992, abundances of major taxonomic categories at disturbed sites had either converged or paralleled populations at Unoiled sites. Abundances of littleneck clams, Leukoma (Protothaca) staminea, slowly increased at Treated sites and converged with Unoiled sites by 2000. Infaunal population differences positively correlated with fine-grained sediments at Treated sites. We believe that sediment fines removal during cleanup, and subsequent slow natural replenishment, impeded the return of the environment to pre-spill conditions. This suggests physical recovery of spill-affected beaches is an important precursor to biological recovery. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Walruses winter together in the Bering Sea, however subadults and females with dependent young summer in the Chukchi Sea while many adult males remain in the Bering Sea. The rapid retreat of sea ice in recent years is changing walrus summer habitat and may be changing their summer distribution and haulout behavior, requiring that walruses haul out on land instead of ice. Oil and gas activity has recently increased in the Chukchi Sea and may compound the impact to walruses elevating the importance of understanding walrus movements, feeding behavior, and habitat requirements necessary for the conservation and management of the species. Satellite transmitters placed on walruses near the communities of Little Diomede, Wales, Nome, Point Hope, Point Lay, Wainwright, and Barrow in spring would provide information on migration route, speed of travel, feeding areas and haulout behavior.

The integration of these data with chemical-physical parameters provides a comprehensive quality assessment. This research was applied to a sediment core collected in the Augusta bay, where a very large commercial and military harbor and one of the largest petrochemical poles in Europe are present. Inside the petrochemical area also operated, from 1958 to 2003, a chlor-alkali plant with mercury cell technology which caused anthropic contamination of surrounding land and marine areas. The sediment core was collected in front of this plant and characterized for grain size and pollutants directly associated to chlor-alkali activity, such as mercury (Hg), barium (Ba), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Composition of foraminiferal assemblages and faunal parameters such as specific diversity, faunal density, abundance of abnormal specimens, and foraminiferal size were investigated as potential indicators of environmental status.

To determine the relative significance of these two effects upon the nearby infaunal community, the infauna were sampled, and physical measurements were made at various distances from the outfall structure at two transects. One transect was conducted in the wastewater discharge area at 56 m (181 ft), and another transect was conducted along the 30 m (97 ft) depth contour, 2.6 km (1.6 miles) inshore from the wastewater discharge area. The results of this study found significant alteration in grain size and sediment organic carbon content at the inshore transect that extended several hundred meters downcurrent and less than 200 m (650 ft) upcurrent from the reef structure. While abundances of crustaceans and molluscs are usually enhanced near wastewater discharges, abundances of these groups decreased near the pipe structure at the inshore transect. Abundance of polychaetes, particularly Melinna oculata, increased near the pipe structure at the inshore transect. This increase in density was positively correlated with increase in fine sediments near the pipe. The brittlestar Amphiodia urtica, generally considered a sensitive indicator of wastewater discharges, had depressed abundances at the inshore transect up to 400 m (1300 ft) from the pipe structure. Discharge effects upon this species extended much further. While recovery of this species over large areas near the discharge correlates with improved treatment strategies, effective source control, and decreasing sediment contaminant concentrations, our results indicate that this species may never fully recover to historical abundance levels near the pipe structure because of reef effects. Compliance with wastewater discharge permits generally requires that the discharge does not adversely impact the environment and that a balanced indigenous population persists near the discharge. Thus, the purpose of this study was to distinguish changes in infaunal communities due to discharge effects from those associated with reef effects.",,,,,California and the World Ocean 97 Conference on Taking a Look at Californias Ocean Resources - An Agenda for the FutureCalifornia and the World Ocean 97 Conference on Taking a Look at Californias Ocean Resources - An Agenda for the Future,"MAR 24-27, 1997MAR 24-27, 1997",,"SAN DIEGO, CASAN DIEGO, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,0-7844-0297-3,,,,,,,,,"MEC Analyt Syst Inc, Carlsbad, CA 92008 USA",MEC Analyt Syst Inc,,,1998-01-01,WOS:000075224700166,,

Public policies created to safeguard offshore aquaculture (OSA) producers and limit small-scale fishing (SSF) activities must be adjusted accordingly in order to maximize income and keep discontentment at a minimum. We collected primary data from stakeholders, fishers (n = 18) and offshore aquaculture operators (n = 3) through participatory workshops and interviews by eliciting problematic issues derived from the offshore area creation and their relative relevance. We used these data to populate conditional probability tables and construct a related influence diagram (Bayesian belief networks) to model the affected system. We selected nine scenarios based on navigability and aquaculture area size with the aim of finding the best expected utility combinations for the OSA SSF system. The inferred results show that maximizing employment and keep pollution at low levels were the most influential factors to keep the system at a satisfactory level. The best decision was not to enlarge the aquaculture area, but to condition the access to other operational stakeholders, namely SSF operators from nearby areas.

Approximately 1000 fish were collected over 2 yr to test possible effects of ontogeny, habitat, and a non-trawl artificial reef permit area on red snapper diets. Stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15), and sulfur (delta 34S) were measured in both red snapper and potential primary producers. Ontogenetic shifts in diet occurred with increasing red snapper size-at-age, resulting in higher delta(13) C and nitrogen delta N-15 and lower delta S-34 in larger fish. Stomach content results supported ontogenetic shifts in diet by showing a change in diet from zooplankton, mysid shrimp, and squid for juvenile red snapper (ages 0 to 1) to diets dominated by benthic crustaceans and fishes for adults (ages 2+). Habitat-specific differences in isotopes and stomach contents of similarly sized fish were identified; however, feeding differences appeared to reflect ontogeny more than habitat type. In addition, seasonal differences, both in delta C-13 and in prey identified from stomach contents, were detected, but were minimal. Red snapper from areas outside a single non-trawl reef permit area had higher delta N-15 and lower delta S-34 values than for conspecifics collected inside the non-trawl reef permit area. This study highlights the use of stable isotopes in detecting red snapper feeding differences inside and outside of an artificial reef permit area in the northern GOM, but additional studies are needed to verify if similar trends are present in other areas.",,,,,,,,,99,2,0,0,92,1,139,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000257413800020,,

The methodology adopted for the paper consisted of the structured review of 35 Environmental Statements (ESs) along with interviews with regulators, operators, consultants and advisory bodies.

No significant differences were found in the size distributions of the two zones, among sites within southern ecoregions, or among the analyzed cruises. This homogeneity in size structure is remarkable since the zones analyzed possess very different species compositions and environmental conditions. The observed size structures were adequately described by non-linear distributions rather than the traditionally employed linear normalized biomass size spectra.

It seeks to reduce the negative impacts of marine infrastructure by introducing a new reflexive civil engineering approach. It requires a valuation of nature with the aim of reducing impacts by incorporating intelligent design and habitat-centered construction. The principle advocated in this paper is to design coastal infrastructures, at micro- to macro-biological scales, using a combination of fine and large scale physical and chemical modifications to hard substrates, within the scope of civil engineering requirements.

I. species in the Sea of Azov (SA) based on the results of our own research and literature review. The first known record of Cystoseira s. I. was made 100 years ago at Cape Khroni, and at the Kazantyp Peninsula (Crimean coast). At present. there have been 22 reports of Cystoseira s. l. from 18 sites registered along the Southern coast of the SA (17 along the Crimean coast and one at the Taman Peninsula). Treptacantha barbata (Stackh.) Orellana et Sanson (- Cystoseira barbata (Stackh.) C.Agardh) is the most widespread of the two species (present in 17 sites). It forms dense communities with a biomass of 1.5-3.5 kg/m(2). Carpodesmia crinita (Duby) Orellana et Sansen (Cystoseira crinita Duby) was found in only two locations. It was discovered that the distribution of some Cystoseira s. l. within the modern boundaries of the Azov coincide with the boundaries of the Pre-Strait area of the SA, where salinity significantly higher, than in other areas. The distribution range has a linear configuration: it covers the Crimean coast from Cape Krasny Kut in the west to Cape Khroni in the east; it is interrupted by the open water area of the Kerch Strait, and continues further onto the Taman coast from Cape Achilleion to Cape Pekly. Outside the specified area, Cystoseira s. l. do not occur, even if hard substrates are present. This shows, that salinity is a limiting factor for the distribution of T. barbata and C. crinita in SA. In the past, the system of marginal seas of the Mediterranean basin (to which SA also belongs) went through a series of transgressive and regressive phases. As a result, the boundaries, ecological conditions, and composition of biota have changed several times within the entire basin and in its individual parts. The assumption was made that in the past Cystoseira s. l. species settled on several occasions in the modern boundaries of the SA. The last invasion into the Pre-Strait area of SA (and inhabiting it up to the present time) happened in the Late Holocene (3.4-3.1 thousand years ago). Further alternation of regressions and transgressions, certainly, were accompanied by fluctuations in the distribution range boundaries, which either receded from the SA to the Kerch Strait, or again returned to its southern shores. At present, they can also fluctuate to a limited extent, following salinity fluctuations. This is mostly relevant to the Crimean coast, where hard substrates are widespread. Considering the continuing salinization of the SA due to decreased river runoff caused by climate change, the spread of Cystoseira s. l. species is now possible onto the Alanonay coast up to the top of the Arabat Bay. This does not allow us to classify them as an alien species in SA. However, in SA under modern conditions, the sustainable vegetation of the Cystoseira s. l. species, with the formation of dense communities at a considerable distance from the Pre-Strait area, is impossible. This must he taken into account when artificial reefs are installed and conservation strategies are developed.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1521-9429,1940-4328,,,,,,,,,,"Nikitsky Bot Gardens, Natl Sci Ctr, UA-98648 Yalta, Crimea, Ukraine",,,,2021-01-28,BCI:BCI202100171960,,

The study was conducted at Bidong Island, Terengganu started from April to October 2014. There were 2 types of ALR used in this study; rough and smooth surfaces. A total of 64 pieces of ALR were deployed in April 2014 and retrieved in June, August and October 2014 respectively. Identification in terms of coral spat species and macrobenthic organisms was done after the each retrieval. Coral spat was identified based on the morphology of their columella, septa and corallite wall by using Dinolight Digital Camera. Four species of coral juveniles (Pocillopora damicornis, Stylophora pistillata, Seriatopora hystrix and Acropora millepora) were found attached on ALR surfaces. Whereby, there were 11 phyla of epibenthic organisms were found to attach on ALR which dominated by turf algae and red algae. Percentage coverage of epibenthic calculated using Coral Point Count with Excel extension (CPCe) shown ALR was dominated by turf algae after 2 months (69%) and 4 months (20%) of deployment respectively. Afterward, Red algae (31%) dominated after 6 months of deployment. There was significant difference between coral species and the surfaces (p<0.05).

Fishermen and geologists can tell us broadly about the types of sealoor found in various areas, but such information tends to be patchy at best and the sealoor can vary dramatically over a small area. To make informed decisions about human activities that afect the oceans, managers need fairly high resolution maps of the physical and biological features that constitute habitat for fish, crabs, whales, sea lions, and other marine life. Habitat maps are important not only for fishery managers, but also for decision makers regarding oil and gas development, marine mining, and other activities that can afect habitats for marine life. Marine habitat mapping can be deined as the collection and synthesis of physical and biological data necessary to diferentiate environmental features that are meaningful to marine organisms-the features that make a particular area suitable or preferable for basic life functions such as feeding, reproduction, and avoiding predators. Habitat maps coupled with biological surveys help scientists learn which environments contribute most to the growth, reproduction, and survival of marine species. Managers can use such habitat maps to design protective measures for necessary habitats with greater certainty about societal beneits. In short, habitat mapping is a key element for improving the sustainable management of Alaska's living marine resources.

Stratified random sampling was used to select days for analysis of fishing effort from digital images. Fishing effort estimates derived from the digital images were adjusted to account for visibility bias using information from a validation study. The levels of effort recorded in the first two seasons were low as the AR had been recently deployed and colonization of the AR by sessile organisms and fishes was still occurring. The effort intensity (fisher hours per square kilometer) at the Sydney AR was compared with three South Australian ARs and 14 estuarine fisheries in New South Wales (NSW) to provide context for the study. Effort intensity at the AR was found to be up to 12 times higher than that recorded from some estuarine fisheries in NSW. Conversely, the levels of effort intensity at two South Australian ARs were much higher compared to those at the Sydney AR site in both survey years. Effort intensity comparisons showed that the relative levels of usage at Australian ARs were higher than those recorded from estuarine fisheries. The Sydney AR provides diverse fishing opportunities that may be concentrated in a small area. Camera-based technologies can provide a solution for cost effective monitoring of AR sites, providing the accuracy of fishing effort information derived from camera images is validated.

Previous research focused on the carbon dynamics of organic-rich ecosystems (e.g., salt marshes, mangroves), while little attention has paid to the carbon cycling of carbonate-rich ecosystems such as chenier plains, sandy or shelly beach ridges that are parts of strand plains. Here we examined the carbon stocks and fluxes of the poorly studied chenier plain in the Yellow River Delta, China. The inorganic and organic carbon pools in the top 1 m sediment were 444 +/- 92 Mg C ha(-1) and 89 +/- 7 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. The average CO2 net sequestration was -177 +/- 51 Mg C ha(-1), indicating that the chenier plain had a net CO2 evasion during the entire soil formation process. With plant growth, however, the chenier plain provided a significant carbon sink (395 g C m(-2) a(-1)) on a per-unit area basis. The annual gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) were 1067 and 672 g C m(-2) a(-1), respectively. The carbon sink strength of the chenier plain was comparable to that of organic-rich salt marshes on a per-unit area basis. The biomass carbon pool was 5.0 +/- 1.4 Mg C ha(-1) in the chenier plain. Moreover, the sediment inorganic carbon content in mudflats was significantly lower than that of vegetated habitats. Our results showed that plant grown in a chenier plain could significantly enhance carbon sequestration by increasing organic carbon storage. Inorganic carbon storage should be considered in blue carbon inventories because inorganic carbon dominates the carbon pool and is important in the carbon cycling in a chenier plain. Our findings can help us better understand the carbon cycling of carbonate-rich coastal ecosystems and can inform chenier plain conservation and restoration efforts.",,,,,,,,,8,1,0,0,3,0,10,,,0168-1923,1873-2240,,,,,,,,,,"Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R ChinaNatl Marine Environm Monitoring Ctr, Key Lab Ecol Environm Coastal Areas SOA, Dalian 116023, Peoples R ChinaUniv New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USAAdm Binzhou Shell Dike Isl & Wetland Natl Nat Res, Binzhou 251900, Peoples R China",Adm Binzhou Shell Dike Isl & Wetland Natl Nat Res,,,2019-08-26,WOS:000480376400014,,

Strymon Basin was a peripheral shallow-water basin during the first MSC stage. The Akropotamos sections expose a clastic sequence with gypsum intercalations, which is dated in the Messinian based on the ostracod and calcareous nannofossil assemblages. This sequence records the Primary Lower Gypsum deposition in a shallow marine environment and its passage via the Messinian erosional surface to a brackish environment with changing salinity conditions similar to the Paratethyan depositional environments. The sequence is capped by a travertine marker horizon observed across the entire Strymon Basin indicating freshwater environment. The Miocene-Pliocene transition is characterized by salinity changes caused by the interaction between Atlantic-Mediterranean and Paratethyan waters, predating the marine reflooding at the end of the MSC, which is attested by the overlying Pliocene open marine deposits. The offshore Prinos-Nestos basin incorporates the Nestos intermediate basin and the Prinos intermediate-deep basin. Borehole and seismic profile data from the offshore Prinos-Nestos oil field reflect a thick clastic sequence, topped by turbidites, and followed by an evaporitic unit deposited during the Messinian. In the Nestos slope area, the evaporite unit consists of anhydrite-shale alternations. Toward the basin's depocenter (Prinos Basin), anhydrite is replaced by halite. The sequence is overlain by Pliocene-Holocene deltaic prograding deposits. Sedimentologic and biostratigraphic data show that the thick halite-shale couplets in the deepest part of the offshore Prinos-Nestos Basin were deposited under permanent marine conditions, suggesting no desiccation before, during, and after the MSC. Conclusively, the present results indicate that a connection between the Mediterranean and the Paratethys was occasionally established before the Pliocene reflooding and favor the non-desiccation MSC model for the deep marine evaporite deposition.

In New Zealand, there is significant interest in establishing species other than Pinus radiata D. Don (the dominant plantation species) in the belief that alternative species are better suited to deliver these services. Significant risk is associated with this position as there is little objective data to support these views. To identify which species were likely to be planted to deliver ecosystem services, a survey was distributed to examine stakeholder perceptions. Stakeholders were asked which of 15 tree attributes contributed to the provision of five ecosystem services (amenity value, bioenergy production, carbon capture, the diversity of native habitat, and erosion control/water quality) and to identify which of 22 candidate tree species possessed those attributes. These data were combined to identify the species perceived most suitable for the delivery of each ecosystem service. Sequoia sempervirens (D.Don) Endl. closely matched the stakeholder derived ideotypes associated with all five ecosystem services.

Leading hypotheses to explain this phenomenon invoke a greater efficiency of the ocean's biological pump, in which case carbon storage in the deep sea would have been accompanied by a corresponding reduction in dissolved oxygen. We exploit the sensitivity of organic matter preservation in marine sediments to bottom water oxygen concentration to constrain the level of dissolved oxygen in the deep central equatorial Pacific Ocean during the last glacial period (18,000-28,000 years BP) to have been within the range of 20-50 mu mol/kg, much less than the modern value of similar to 168 mu mol/kg. We further demonstrate that reduced oxygen levels characterized the water column below a depth of similar to 1,000 m. Converting the ice age oxygen level to an equivalent concentration of respiratory CO2, and extrapolating globally, we estimate that deep-sea CO2 storage during the last ice age exceeded modern values by as much as 850 Pg C, sufficient to balance the loss of carbon from the atmosphere (similar to 200 Pg C) and from the terrestrial biosphere (similar to 300-600 Pg C). In addition, recognizing the enhanced preservation of organic matter in ice age sediments of the deep Pacific Ocean helps reconcile previously unexplained inconsistencies among different geochemical and micropaleontological proxy records used to assess past changes in biological productivity of the ocean.Plain Language Summary Carbon dioxide (CO2) in Earth's atmosphere was lower during cold glacial periods of the last 800,000 years than during warm interglacial periods, by an amount equivalent to about one third of the preindustrial CO2 content of the atmosphere. It is thought that the ocean absorbed the CO2 missing from the atmosphere, but determining where and how the CO2 was stored in the ocean has remained a challenge. Photosynthesis in the surface ocean converts CO2 to organic matter, a portion of which sinks into the deep sea, where it is subsequently converted back to CO2 by respiration of the organisms that consume the organic matter. Stimulation of the biological uptake of CO2 in surface water, inhibition of the physical processes that raise deep waters back to the surface where they exchange gases with the atmosphere, or any combination of the two would enhance the storage of CO2 in the deep ocean while also reducing the concentration there of dissolved oxygen. Here we show that the oxygen concentration in deep waters of the Pacific Ocean was much lower during the last glacial period than today. The difference is sufficient to accommodate the CO2 removed from the atmosphere during the ice ages.",,,,,,,,,66,1,0,0,18,0,70,,,0886-6236,1944-9224,,,,,,,,,,"Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USAColumbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Palisades, NY 10964 USAUniv Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USAUniv Maine, Sch Earth & Climate Sci, Orono, ME USAAustralian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT, AustraliaCUNY Coll Staten Isl, Dept Engn & Environm Sci, New York, NY USAUniv Bern, Inst Geol Sci, Bern, SwitzerlandUniv Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland",,,,2019-03-01,WOS:000464651600005,,

In order to adaptively plan for essential marsh preservation, we recognize the importance of the investigation of marsh archives for the perspective they provide toward resilience. Our objective in this study is to examine the relationship of tidal marsh carbon sequestration with both climate change and human impact throughout past centuries and millennia. A Hudson River marsh sediment core spanning the last 2000 years is analyzed for bulk loss on ignition (LOI), bulk density, sedimentation rate, carbon (C) and mineral flux, and x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis including lead, copper, titanium and potassium. We compare this record to previously established pollen and spore stratigraphy from the same site, along with an extensive macrofossil based AMS C-14 chronology based upon both cores. Carbon accumulation generally follows sediment accumulation rates, which were higher than 200 g C m(-2) yr(-1) prior to 1500 years ago. Declines in carbon storage rate during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) are linked to drought, fire, and charcoal, while lesser declines during the Little Ice Age (LIA) are linked to cooling and a shorter growing season. Subsequent human impact with marsh haying practices also led to carbon accumulation rate decline to 100 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Increases in C sequestration rates in recent decades may be attributable to nitrogen pollution of the estuary, invasive plants, and/or increased flooding, but the lack of mineral sediment threatens their stability. Ecosystem function is declining with the loss of foundational species, and the crisis is deepening for preservation of this habitat. We strongly recommend strategies for minimizing marsh loss.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,1,10,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USAColumbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY 10027 USAUSDA, Athens, GA USA",,,,2020-06-24,WOS:000539743200001,,

Here, a network modeling approach is used to test the scale, structure, and estimated costs of an integrated European CO2 transport network for different amounts of CCS deployment. Models are optimized with the sole objective of creating the least cost pipeline network that joins all sources to sufficient storage for a 25-year period of operation, and assume no restrictions on trans-boundary transport of CO2, or due to topographical constraints. Results show that extensive CO2 pipeline networks are required to deliver the CCS contribution to decarbonization. Sufficient storage is available but is distributed such that even for low levels of CCS deployment, both offshore storage and trans-boundary transport of CO2 are needed. Scenarios are run to test pipeline infrastructure requirements should onshore CO2 storage not be permitted, giving an estimated increase in CO2 transport infrastructure cost of 10-30% ((sic)3-7 billion). Scenarios examining the effect of removing the more speculative storage potential in the Baltic, close to central and eastern European CO2 source clusters, reinforce the need to experimentally validate theoretical storage capacity estimates especially in the Baltic and North Sea.

Nonetheless, the deployment of tidal energy systems is associated with potential environmental impacts as prime resource sites often coincide with unique ecosystems inhabited by sensitive organisms. Previous studies have generally focused on the hydrodynamic impact of tidal energy schemes, i.e. how schemes alter the flow dynamics and sedimentary transport processes. Whilst these efforts are key in understanding environmental impacts, there is no straightforward step for translating sediment to faunal changes. Species distribution models offer methods to quantitatively predict certain possible impacts of tidal energy extraction. The River Severn is a distinguished candidate region for tidal energy in the UK featuring sites under stringent ecological protection regulations. We examine the impact of a proposed Severn tidal barrage on 14 species via the linking of hydrodynamic modelling to species distribution models. Through a selection of species that are linked via a simple food web system we extrapolate changes in prey species to the respective predator species. We show that species at lower trophic levels would be adversely affected by the barrage, but higher trophic level organisms increase in possible habitable area. Once food web relationships are acknowledged this increase in habitat area decreases, but is still net positive. Overall, all 14 species were affected, with most gaining in distribution area, and only four losing distribution area within the Severn Estuary. We conclude that a large-scale tidal barrage may have detrimental and complex impacts on species distribution, altering food web dynamics and altering food availability in the Severn Estuary.

Organic contaminants accumulate mainly in the body fat of the organisms; northern ecosystems are therefore especially vulnerable because fat has much greater ecological importance in such systems than in more southerly ecosystems.In recent years there has been public concern in both Norway and Russia over the possibility of radioactive pollution. Nuclear power plants, nuclear vessels and weapons are present in the area and produce radioactive wastes. Reports of wastes have influenced public opinion in many countries.The Barents Sea is strongly influenced by ocean climate variations. Global climate models forecast that the most elevated ocean temperatures due to possible greenhouse effects will probably occur in polar regions.",,,,,,,,,22,0,2,0,9,0,25,,,0004-0843,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1995-09-01,WOS:A1995RW96700008,,

During the last half-century coastal dunes integrity has been widely altered by land use change; however, procedures and study cases assessing how in particular their carbon storage and sequestration capacity are affected by land take over this period are still scarse.To fill such knowledge gap, we investigated to which extent urban growth has altered soil carbon sink in a representative sector of the Mediterranean dune system, from 1954 to 2006.Specifically, we propose a procedure that combining experimental data of soil carbon stocks and multi temporal cover maps allows assessing C stock variation over time. Based on field data we quantified soil carbon storage provided by the main dune habitat types of the Adriatic coast (Beach with Pioneer annual Vegetation, Herbaceous Dune Vegetation and Mediterranean Macchia). Using detailed multi-temporal land cover maps (1954, 1986 and 2006) we quantified the fraction of natural dune habitats replaced by urban areas over time, by means of transition matrices. Then, by combining carbon stocks values with the results of transition matrices, we estimated the C stock loss for natural dunes due to land take.Results show that natural dune habitats have an important role as soil carbon sinks and land take has depleted them with different rates, causing a total net loss of 117 data of soil C in the first time step and a total net loss of 70 data of soil C in the second time step (similar to 40% of soil C stock in the last 53 years).Our work underlines the fragility of natural coastal dunes, which during the last decades have become a privileged destination for touristic and recreational activities, thus been progressively replaced by artificial areas, with a direct impact on their carbon storage capacity and the other precious services they provide.By combining ecosystem services measurements with multi-temporal mapping techniques, we enhanced our understanding of transformation processes on coastal dunes, offering as well new insights for dune management.",,,,,,,,,18,1,0,0,11,0,20,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Molise, EnviX Lab, Dept Biosci & Terr, I-86090 Pesche, IS, ItalyCNR, Inst Marine Sci CNR ISMAR Arsenale, Tesa 104,Castello 2737-F, I-30123 Venice, VE, ItalyCzech Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Appl Geoinformat & Spatial Planning, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech RepublicUniv Rome III, Dept Sci, Vle Marconi 446, I-00146 Rome, Italy",,,,2018-02-01,WOS:000430634500094,,

Its discharge into the marine environment of the North Sea is strictly regulated. This paper discusses the environmental concerns associated with produced water, and the regulatory approach that is currently being taken to reduce produced water discharges into the sea. It is found that there is currently no evidence of harm to the marine environment from produced water, but a number of areas of uncertainty remain. A novel methodology, involving the analysis of material and energy flows, and their associated financial and environmental implications, is used to compare a number of different techniques of reducing these discharges. It is found that these techniques have significant environmental and financial implications. In the absence of evidence of actual environmental harm being caused by produced water, there are three possible precautionary approaches to its management and regulation. The approach that involves zero emissions of produced water implies a relatively high social valuation of the reduction in environmental risk that this achieves. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This article focuses on the behaviour of corrosion rate of steel located near shore environment and the aim is to determine the effect of sediment on corrosion of steel. To investigate that, simulated near shore sediment conditions have been used where the steel coupons buried in sediments which have different characteristics. Weight loss technique has been implemented to determine the weight loss rate of the steel specimens. Based on the results of this study, metal weight loss increases as the duration of exposure to seabed sediment environment become longer. The sea sediment simulated condition has given significant levels of corrosion.

In addition to this, mussels were caged along the coast affected by the HAVEN disaster. The physiological status of fish and mussels was assessed using a battery of stress and exposure biomarkers. The PAH content of mussel and fish tissues was also analyzed. Significant biological responses were observed in lysosomal membrane stability, neutral lipid and lipofuscin accumulation and micronucleus frequency for mussels caged at two sites close to the HAVEN wreck. Chemical analyses indicated, however, that these effects are not caused by aromatic hydrocarbons. For this reason, we suggest that the aftermath of the HAVEN disaster contributes very little to coastal ecosystem pollution. This was also confirmed by the few biological effects observed in fish specimens (Boops boops) collected from surface waters.

The importance of substrate, predation, hydrodynamic conditions and location on mussel restoration success was studied using artificially created mussel beds. Experimental beds established on a stable substrate (coir net) were compared with control beds established on sand, at three locations in the Wadden Sea. Their persistence was followed over time. The results revealed a near disappearance of all experimental beds in just over 7 months. Providing a stable substrate did not improve mussel survival. Predation could not explain the disappearance of the beds, as the maximal predation rate by birds was found to be insufficient to have a significant effect on mussel cover. Differences in wave conditions alone could also not explain the variation in decline of mussel cover between the locations. However, the gradual disappearance of mussels from the seaward side of the bed strongly suggested that hydrodynamic conditions (i.e. combined effects of waves and current) played an important role in the poor persistence of the artificial beds. Our results highlight the fact that restoration of mussel beds in dynamic areas cannot simply be implemented by mussel transplantation, particularly if additional measures to prevent wave losses are not taken, even when artificial substrate is provided to facilitate mussel adhesion.

However, the hydrodynamic disturbance and environmental impacts of this activity are not yet fully understood. In this study, a process-based depth-averaged model is used to evaluate quantitatively the possible impacts of intertidal reclamation for the southern Yellow Sea region. The simulation results show that reclamation of both inshore and offshore intertidal areas of similar to 1800 km(2) (according to the approved governmental reclamation scheme) would result in three remarkable changes in tidal patterns: enhanced M-2 and M-4 tidal amplitudes in coastal areas, strengthened negative tidal asymmetry in the southern region of the sand ridge system, and an enhanced tidal energy flux toward offshore through the main channels in the south. These changes would result in some negative impacts. The enhancement in local tidal amplitude could increase the probability of coastal hazards, and the offshore sediment transport tendency resulting from negative tidal asymmetry in the south could lead to severe erosion. The enhanced energy flux transported offshore may also affect far-field regions. On the other hand, alternative reclamation of similar to 400 km(2) of offshore intertidal area could significantly minimize hydrodynamic disturbances to the local tidal system. Offshore reclamation with lower environment impacts may be the future for coastal development. To cope with the potential environmental risks caused by reclamation, it is recommended to strengthen environmental impact assessment and overseeing of reclamation plans, and advance international cooperation in terms of coastal management.

When determining estimates of gas escape across the seabed, the influence of dynamic environments, introducing natural variations in seepage rates must be considered, including tidal cycles. Panarea, Sicily, is the location of a series of natural marine CO2 gas seeps and provides an excellent test bed to investigate variations of natural seabed gas leakage across a tidal cycle. A multivariate statistical approach was used to recognize the relationship when gas leakage is dominated by natural forcing. We show that the tidal height correlates negatively with the bubble sound power spectral density, the gas flux, and the bubble size.

Field experiments were conducted to assess the role of pre-and post-settlement processes in causing high and low extremes in recruitment on opposite sides of an outer coastal island in our study area. The west side of the island has some of the highest population densities measured in New England. Our results indicate that postlarval supply determines these differences in recruitment between the two sites. Standardized replicate cobble plots deployed on each side of the island ruled out habitat differences as an explanation for these differences, because they exhibited the same east-west difference in recruitment as the natural habitat. We also ruled out differing rates of post-settlement loss because we recovered previously marked and released settlers in equal numbers in similar plots from both sites. The distribution of neustonic postlarvae and hydrographic evidence indicate that wind-driven surface transport produces an asymmetric postlarval supply to the two sides of the island during the settlement season. Differences in the degree of asymmetry from year to year correspond to differences in the magnitude of eastward transport. We also conducted experiments at the site receiving high recruitment to assess whether new recruits or older year classes were near the saturation of cobble habitat for these animals. The combination of saturation seeding trials, using hatchery-reared lobsters, and weekly counts of natural recruits and immigrants suggests that lobsters may become increasingly subject to crowding as they grow. Movements away from the initial settlement site, probably in part caused by crowding, tend to smooth the inequality in population density which is set initially by postlarval supply.

This development may continue towards a large-scale operation involving European CO2 and CO2 EOR operation. To this end, a conceptual EOR system was developed here based on an oxyfuel power plant located in Poland that acted as a source for CO2, coupled to a promising oil field located on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Lifecycle assessment was subsequently used to estimate environmental emissions indicators. When averaged over the operational lifetime, results show greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 0.4 kg CO2-eq per kg oil (and n kWh associated electricity) produced, of which 64 % derived from the oxyfuel power plant. This represents a 71 % emission reduction when compared to the same amount of oil and electricity production using conventional technology. Other environmental impact indicators were increased, showing that this type of CO2 EOR system may help reach GHG reduction targets, but care should be taken to avoid problem shifting.",,,,,,,,,13,2,0,0,1,0,14,,,1750-5836,1878-0148,,,,,,,,,,"NILU Norwegian Inst Air Res, Dept Environm Impacts & Sustainabil, POB 100, N-2027 Kjeller, NorwaySINTEF Ind, Sustainable Energy Technol Dept, POB 4760, N-7465 Trondheim, NorwaySilesian Tech Univ, Inst Thermal Technol, Konarskiego 22, PL-44100 Gliwice, PolandSINTEF Ind, Dept Proc Technol, Kjolnes Ring 30, N-3918 Porsgrunn, NorwayAGH Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Energy & Fuels, PL-30059 Krakow, PolandInst Transport Econ, Dept Technol, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway",,,,2020-01-06,WOS:000504446800012,,

Sea bed logging is an application of marine controlled source electromagnetic sounding applied for mainly offshore hydrocarbon detection in the subsurface. The basis of the approach is the difference in resistivity values of matter which comprise the subsurface and the overlying layers. A mobile electric dipole emits a low frequency electromagnetic signal both into the overlying water column and downwards into the seabed. An array of sea floor receivers measures both the amplitude and the phase of the received signal that depend on the resistivity structure beneath the seabed. A survey consisting of many transmitter and receiver locations can be used to determine a multidimensional model of subsea floor resistivity. The received signal is a composition of many signal which are multiplexed to form a complex signal. This signal consists of wanted and unwanted data of which the technique described in here separates the unwanted air waves from the wanted. A mathematical model to quantify the amount of airwave at any given sea water depth from a defined offset is proposed. The method described here has managed to eliminate more than 99.5 percent of the airwave noise from shallow water deep target environment data.

At the core of this is a sustainable electricity supply system that makes optimum use of decentralised assets and in which energy consumers participate actively in appropriately structured decentralised markets. This major change from the present arrangement, where most consumers are passive users of externally supplied energy services, will require new attitudes to energy and new ways working. The technical, market and social aspects of this transformation will be addressed in detail by the multi-disciplinary consortium that has been formed to embrace power system engineers, experts in electricity markets and researchers aware of the social and perceptual challenges.The technical developments that underpin the changes outlined above are the development of new high efficiency micro-CHP units (including the latest high temperature solid oxide fuel cells), the development of ever cheaper PV and micro-wind systems and the role out of smart electricity meters that will facilitate the involvement of even domestic consumers in demand side management. As time varying renewable sources become increasing prevalent in electricity supply, both in the form of small decentralised generators, and in the form of major offshore wind farms, tidal and wave energy installations, the role of highly decentralised load management will become ever more important. In addition the power electronic interfaces of decentralised generators can be used to provide more than just power - with suitable control other important network services like local voltage control, and even system frequency control, can be contributed.The consortium builds on the important work undertaken by the Highly Distributed Power Systems (HDPS) project that established base line models for the new technologies, developed suitable scenarios, and developed the cell concept of delivery.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/G031681/1,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15352077,,

[Subacoustech Report No. 544R0738.],,,,,,,,i,"iv, 1-80",,,,,,,,,,,Book,2007,2007,"Subacoustech Ltd has been contracted by The Crown Estate on behalf of the Collaborative Offshore Wind Research Into the Environment (COWRIE) to measure the underwater noise generated by offshore windfarms during construction and operation. The purpose of the programme of measurements is to provide information which will aid the estimation and minimisation of the impact of noise during the lifecycle (construction, operation and decommissioning) of windfarms. Previous reports have established that pile driving during windfarm construction creates high levels of underwater noise. Injury of marine species could be caused by the pile driving noise at distances of the order of 100 metres, and behavioural effects at ranges of the order of 10 kilometres or more. To further document the noise levels created during pile driving, further measurements are presented herein, taken during pile driving on five windfarms, at North Hoyle, Scroby Sands, Kentish Flats, Barrow and Burbo Bank. The measurements indicate that the Source Levels of these five pile driving operations varied between 243 and 257 dB re 1 Pa @ 1 metre, having an average value of 250 dB re 1 Pa @ 1 metre. The Transmission Losses were characterised by values of geometric loss factor N of 17 to 21, and absorption factor of 0.0003 to 0.0047 dB/m. The measurements are analysed in the dBht metric, which weights noise according to the hearing sensitivity of marine species of animals, and thus indicates the likely loudness of the noise. The concept of noise dose, used to estimate the cumulative effect of noise on humans, may also be extended to marine mammals by this means. On this basis, a method which is relatively simple to calculate and apply is proposed for estimating areas around a pile driving operation within which the two key auditory effects of noise will occur. This method may be summarised as Provided animals are free to flee the noise, those within the area bounded by the 90 dBht level contour will strongly avoid the noise. Animals within the area bounded by the 130 dBht level contour may suffer injury or permanent damage to hearing. Since the injury ranges indicated by the measurements do not exceed a few hundred metres, they indicate that observation by marine mammal observers and soft start procedures might be effective in reducing these effects of the noise. Measurements are also presented of noise during the operation of the North Hoyle, Scroby Sands, Kentish Flats and Barrow offshore windfarms. In general, the level of noise created by operational windfarms was found to be very low and no evidence was found of noise levels that might have the capacity to cause marine animals to avoid the area. The environment of a windfarm was found to be on average about 2 dB noisier for fish, and no noisier for marine mammals, than the surrounding area. This is no more than variations which might be encountered by these animals during their normal course of activity.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-9554279-5-4,,,,,,,,,"Subacoustech Ltd, Chase Mill, Winchester Rd, Waltham, Hampshire, SO32 1A, United Kingdom",,,,2007-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14503017855,,

Changes of cross-shore profiles in sandy beaches will have considerable influence over the coastal zone management in particular. The relation among the shoreline, the long-shore bar and the stable point of cross-shore profiles is discussed by field data in Japan coast and the site plan of offshore breakwater, artificial reef, etc. is proposed in this paper. Cross-shore profiles of sandy beaches are changed by factors of incident wave, water depth, near-shore current, beach material, etc. The data of waves, tides, beach materials, bottom sounding charts surveyed in fields for the past few years was used to investigate cross-shore profiles of sandy beaches along coasts of the Sea of Pacific, the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan in Hokkaido of Japan. Results are as follows;1. A stable point where the sediment transport was not moved remarkably on the bottom slope existed on cross-shore profiles obtained by overlapping sounding charts of every season and year.2. The sediment transport was mainly moving between the shoreline and the stable point.3. The sand bar arising between the shoreline and the stable point was influenced by the wave reflection from sandy beaches.4. On-offshore movements of the sand bar were classified by advancing or retreating of the shoreline.5. The water depth of the sand bar crest was in proportion to the water depth of trough on-shore side of the sand bar.6. The sand bar was closely related to the position of the shoreline and the stable point.7. The sand bar was moved for the shore by constructing the offshore breakwater for accretion.8.

In contrast, genomic analysis of sediments revealed that the bacterial community from 250 m was different (SAB = 70) from other locations further from the discharge, suggesting that the produced water had a detectable effect on the bacterial community in the sediment closest to the discharge.

Both technologies offer advantages over the use of traditional shore stabilization methods, including preservation of natural materials, use of otherwise unsuitable or waste materials, recycling paths, and, in the case of sand-filled containers, a soft approach to shoreline stabilization. This paper evaluates the stability of two types of concrete tetrahedrons: 100% concrete tetrahedrons and concrete/rubber mix tetrahedrons for use in submerged breakwaters and artificial reefs. Wave tank testing of scale model tetrahedron components was conducted to compare the stability of concrete tetrahedrons to limestone boulders. The study demonstrated that 100% concrete tetrahedrons are suitable for use in submerged breakwaters and artificial reefs. Concrete/rubber mix tetrahedrons are suitable for use in artificial reefs.

This study investigated reefs from the Changdao coastal zone to determine the structures and functions of bacterial biofilms symbiosing with various algae using high-throughput sequencing analysis. The Shannon diversity index of microbiota with algal symbiosis reached 5.34, which was higher than that of microbiota wherein algae were absent (4.80). The beta diversity results for 11 samples revealed that there existed a separation between bacterial communities on reefs with and without attached algae, while communities with similar algae clustered together. The taxa mostly associated with algae-symbiotic microbiota are the Actinobacteria phylum, and the Flavobacterlia and Gammaproteobacteria classes. The Cyanobacteria phylum was not associated with algae-symbiotic microbiota. As revealed by functional analysis, the bacteria mostly involved in the metabolism of sulfur were represented by brown and red algae in the biofilm symbiosis. Bacteria related to the metabolism of certain trace elements were observed only in specific groups. Moreover, phototrophy-related bacteria were less abundant in samples coexisting with algae. This study established the link between bacterial biofilms and algal settlements on costal reefs, and revealed the possible holobiont relationship between them.

We have studied adult, larval, and recruit populations of S. sanguinea from sublittoral (approximately 10 m depth) communities at Blanes (Spain, NW Mediterranean). At the study site, the species colonises semi-obscure caves and, to a lesser extent, communities of sciaphilic algae. Our first goal was to show the periods of brooding, larval release, and recruitment. Plankton was collected about twice a week between July 1998 and June 2000 over an artificial reef. A total of 303 larvae were collected in 23 of the 102 days of sampling. At the study site the species shows a single, annual larval release period, which occurs from late March to June-July every year. Recruits were found from late May to late August 1999 and in late May 2000. A recruitment peak was observed in July 1999 and again in late May 2000. The presence of brooding adults corresponded to the periods of larval supply and recruitment. Our second goal was to investigate the causes of the variable distribution of the species along several communities in the north-west Mediterranean Sea. We describe adult distribution and the dynamics of larval supply, recruitment of early (<= 15 days from settlement) and late (<= 4 months from settlement) recruits. Patterns of larval presence and early recruit distribution along the communities on the reef did not reflect the adult distributions, whereas this was closely matched by the distribution of late recruits. Post-recruitment mortality strongly affected recruits of the PA (photophilic algae) and SA (sciaphilic algae) communities, whereas it was very low in the communities of SOC (semi-obscure caves). Mortality of recruits was density independent and colony survivorship in the SA communities, where recruitment was the highest, appeared strongly affected by competition with brown algae. Like the majority of cheilostomate bryozoans, S. sanguinea releases a coronate larva capable of active swimming and positive reaction to light. Such swimming abilities may allow larvae to actively select the substrate on which to settle and to avoid unsuitable substrates.

The storage in this manner of captured CO2 emissions from industrial installations and power plants has attracted considerable scientific and technical interest as a potential mitigation response to climate change. A key issue facing policymakers in several countries is how to reconcile policy commitments to develop offshore CO2 storage with other competing - and potentially conflicting - uses of the marine environment. With a view to informing policy responses to this issue, this paper presents a case study of legal and policy frameworks concerning offshore CO2 storage in United Kingdom. The paper maps key design features of the United Kingdom's framework for marine permitting and planning, appraising the extent to which they enable orderly development of offshore CO2 storage in a manner consistent with relevant high-level policy objectives.

Their role as providers of important ecosystem services such as coastal protection, carbon storage and nursery habitats for economically important species is increasingly acknowledged. But mangrove destruction continues, and we might have to face the prospect of a world deprived of the services offered by mangrove ecosystems. Mangrove transformation and destruction is often caused by mismatches in mangrove system management. These root in interests that focus on selected ecosystem services only, but also result from a problem of fit between the spatial scales at which ecosystem services are provided, and those at which their benefits are realized. We argue that a combination of the ecosystem services concept with a careful approach to the issue of scales will help to overcome these problems and improve the management of mangrove systems.

CO2 storage is a part of the CCS to keep the discharged CO2 at deep sub-seabed geological areas. A leakage of this stored CO2 may result in a CO2 bubble plume which causes a pH reduction and an increase in pCO(2) (partial pressure of CO2) of the ocean environment due to the ocean acidification between the leaked CO2 and the seawater. Consequently, this leads to the environmental influence on the marine life. The aim of this article is to propose an integrated model of computational fluid dynamics and population balance model to account for the dynamical behaviour of the leaked CO2 bubble plume via the man-made ocean CO2 storage against a recently published experiment. The integrated model was used to simulate the processes of the breakup, coalescence and mass-transfer between the CO2 bubbles and the seawater, and the momentum of the CO2 bubble plume. Thus, the changes in the pH and pCO(2) of the seawater during the occurrence of the CO2 leakage, and the rising velocity and size distribution of the CO2 bubbles in the plume were predicted. It was found that the predictions had a good agreement compared to the published experimental data. In addition, the predicted profiles were used to analyse the consequences of the CO2 leakage from the small-scale ocean storage. Published. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The development of Ormen Lange is under shared operatorship between Norsk Hydro and Shell. Ormen Lange's untreated well stream will be transported to shore in two 120 km long, 30 in. diameter pipelines to a processing plant at Nyhamna, Norway. From there, gas will be exported via a 42 in., 1200 km subsea pipeline (Langeled) to Easington at the east coast of the UK. The pipelines have to pass over the Storegga slide edge, which rises 200-300 m toward the continental shelf in very steep slopes, which are also encountered in the nearshore Bjornsundet area. The uneven and steep seabed conditions require the use of approximately 2.8x10(6) tons of rock to support and stabilize the pipelines.

Ice formation can heavily compromise the mechanical integrity and energy efficiency of systems such as aircraft, marine structures, power grids, wind turbines, and HVAC systems. The economic cost of ice formation amounts to billions of dollars every year. Active methods of removing ice include spraying chemicals or using electric heating, but such techniques are environmentally and energetically costly. Surfaces that could, by themselves, suppress the growth of ice for many hours or even days would therefore be highly advantageous, but to date, no such surface exists. This proposal seeks to develop smart surfaces that suppress the growth of ice without any mechanical or electrical intervention, leaving the majority of the surface dry even under chilled and humid conditions. The proposed surface will have miniscule structures that will guide the deposition of water in such a way as to reduce ice formation. System optimization will be obtained by modeling the thermodynamics and fluid dynamics of vapor transfer in vapor-liquid-ice multiphase systems, which could also shed fundamental insight on the behavior of mixed-phase clouds. The objective of this proposal is to gain a fundamental understanding of the localized pressure gradients and resulting source-sink interactions between ice, water, and water vapor and to exploit this knowledge to passively suppress the in-plane growth of frost. Using a combination of experimental, theoretical, and computational techniques, the following research tasks are proposed: (1) Characterizing Inter-Droplet Frost Growth: In-plane and out-of-plane inter-droplet ice bridging between a frozen droplet and supercooled liquid droplet will be characterized using a custom-built humidity chamber and hydrophobic surfaces bonded to Peltier stages. The resulting data will be correlated with an evolving-boundary computational model. (2) Creating a Dry Zone around Ice: When a water droplet is frozen before surrounding condensate has a chance to grow appreciably, a stable dry zone forms between the ice droplet and the condensation. An isolated droplet will be frozen just above the dew point and then the humidity will be raised to observe and model the resulting dry zone. (3) Suppression of In-Plane Frost Growth: With the knowledge gained from the previous two tasks, a controlled array of microscopic stripes of ice will be formed on a chemically and/or physically patterned surface, such that the dry zone about each stripe of ice will overlap to keep the vast majority of the surface dry from condensate and frost. A fuller understanding of inter-droplet evaporation and ice bridging in mixed-phase water systems will clarify the thermodynamics and fluid dynamics of frost growth on surfaces and give experimental insight to the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process of glaciation in mixed-phase clouds. Furthermore, the proposed research will map out the critical phase space where the vapor gradients result in ice bridging versus dry zones.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1604272,,,,,,,,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13775609,,

This commercial activity can take the form of aggregate extraction, fishing, installation of facilities such as windmills, cables or pipelines and the construction of bridges, harbours etc.Non-invasive acoustic survey methods play a significant role in the mapping of the submerged cultural heritage. Elements such as archaeological wreck sites exposed on the sea floor are mapped using side-scan and multi-beam techniques. These can also provide information on bathymetric patterns representing potential Stone Age settlements, whereas the detection of such archaeological sites and wrecks partially or wholly embedded in the sea-floor sediments demands the application of high-resolution sub-bottom profilers. This paper presents a strategy for the cost-effective large-scale mapping of unknown sediment-embedded sites such as submerged Stone Age settlements or wrecks, based on sub-bottom profiling with chirp systems.The mapping strategy described includes:a) definition of line spacing depending on the target; b) interactive sailing, i.e. when potential archaeological anomalies are located, their character is immediately investigated in more detail by a denser pattern of sub-bottom survey lines; c) on-site interpretation while acquiring data; d) recognition of anomalies not due to geology.Consequently, this strategy differs from those employed in detailed studies of known wreck sites (eg. Plets et al. 2009) and from the way in which geologists map the sea floor and the geological column beneath it. The strategy has been developed on the basis of extensive practical experience gained from the use of an off-the-shelf 2D chirp system and, given the present state of the technology, appears well-suited to large-scale maritime archaeological mapping.",,,,,MTS/IEEE OCEANS ConferenceMTS/IEEE OCEANS Conference,"JUN 10-14, 2013JUN 10-14, 2013","Marine Technol Soc; IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; SFE Power; Marintek; Norwegian Def Res Estab; Inst Marine Res; Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst; Gersemia, Bekkadal Consultancy & Engn Serv; NERSCMarine Technol Soc; IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; SFE Power; Marintek; Norwegian Def Res Estab; Inst Marine Res; Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst; Gersemia, Bekkadal Consultancy & Engn Serv; NERSC","Bergen, NORWAYBergen, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4799-0000-8; 978-1-4799-0002-2,,,,,,,,,"Strandingsmuseet St George, Ctr Maritime Archaeol, Vesterhavsvej 1E, DK-6990 Ulfborg, Denmark",Strandingsmuseet St George,,,2014-06-11,WOS:000335313100086,,

The harsh marine environment and the need to explore for hydrocarbons in deep and ultra-deep waters has put in place technology and specialized marine support vessels to explore and produce hydrocarbons from below the ocean bed. The specialized vessels engaged in such operations have to maintain a fixed position in relation to a fixed point at the ocean bed despite the harsh vessel position deviating forces of sea currents, waves and wind acting on the floating vessel as little change in the position may lead to accident in the sea. So by the method of Dynamic Positioning the vessel is kept stationary in the sea and then oil and gas is extracted by using drilling vessels or drill ships. This method also allows other vessels like crane vessels, shuttle tanker, dredging and rock dumping vessels, pipelay, cable lay and cable repair vessels to remain stationary in sea so that extraction process takes place efficiently.

The measured annual IP was 123 +/- 86 gC m(-2) year(-1) (338 +/- 235 mgC m(-2) day(-1)), and its seasonal variations can be described with a left-skewed normal distribution curve. The average seasonal IP values from the highest to the lowest were summer (664 +/- 270 mgC m(-2) day(-1)), autumn (350 +/- 118 mgC m(-2) day(-1)), spring (202 +/- 110 mgC m(-2) day(-1)), and winter (137 +/- 68 mgC m(-2) day(-1)). The lowest IP was during the nutrient-rich winter because it had a short insolation duration, low incident photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and low light transmission (shallow euphotic zone depth) due to strong vertical mixing. In contrast to the winter, the highest IP was during the nutrient-depleted summer, which had a long insolation duration, high incident PAR and high light transmission (deeper euphotic zone depth). In addition, the heterotrophic nutrients from upwelling in the south might also support the highest IP in summer. As three primary water masses exist in the Taiwan Strait and three of them have different characteristics, different mixing ratios of water masses may cause different chemical and hydrographic conditions, which leads to different levels of Chl a concentrations and primary production. It is worth to mention that offshore wind farm (OWF) construction in the Changyun Rise (CYR) of the Taiwan Strait is on-going. As primary production is the foundation for a marine ecosystem and supports the food web and fish stock, the results of this research can not only be used as the baseline for evaluating the OWF impact on the marine ecosystem but also be used for assessing their influence on fishery resources.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,8,0,22,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Environm & Ecol, Keelung, TaiwanNatl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Environm Biol & Fisheries Sci, Keelung, TaiwanNatl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Ctr Excellence Oceans, Keelung, Taiwan",,,,2020-02-27,WOS:000513491700001,,

Whilst in the GAB, they are the focus of a commercially important Australian fishery. Recent expansion of activities associated with oil and gas exploration in the GAB over the last five years has raised concerns that noise associated with geophysical surveys and exploratory drilling activities may impact on the migration and behaviour of SBT, with potential flow-on effects on the commercial fishery and current monitoring of the population for management purposes.As a first step in identifying the potential impacts of expansion of oil and gas exploration activities in the GAB on SBT, we establish the historical extent of these activities in the GAB with a primary focus on geophysical surveys. Potential overlap with the distribution of juvenile SBT in the GAB determined from an archival tag dataset (1998-2011) was then explored. Geophysical surveys have occurred throughout the vast majority of the region since 1960, with the size of energy sources used in surveys and the extent of areas surveyed increasing through time. The use of more complex, higher density 3D surveys has increased gradually since 2000. The timing and distribution of exploration activity has had varying degrees of overlap with SBT occurrence and distribution as described by tagged fish.Determining robust measures of the responses to surveys however, is difficult due to a paucity of data on the hearing capabilities of SBT, uncertainties in the true extent of spatial overlap of activities and tagged fish resulting from geolocation methods used for position estimation from archival tag data, complexities in the drivers of behaviour in SBT, and limitations with using observational data to determine cause-and-effect relationships. These difficulties are typical not just of SBT and the GAB region, but apply to investigations of the responses of marine animals to geophysical surveys more broadly. The data presented in this study, however, represent a first step towards understanding oil and gas exploration within a defined region of the Australian marine environment, and provide important context for exploring the potential impact of such activities on a commercially important top order predator of the GAB ecosystem.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,0967-0645,1879-0100,,,,,,,,,,"CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, GPO Box 1538, Hobart, Tas 7001, AustraliaCurtin Univ, Ctr Marine Studies & Technol, Kent St, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia",,,,2019-01-07,WOS:000454184200017,,

Main emphasis has been placed on developing an optimised conceptual design within the structural constraints, and assessing how efficient the capture unit may be operated in consideration of the dynamic behaviour induced by the sea on the absorber and desorber columns via the floating carrier. The rational behind this technology selection is the urgency in making appropriate steps for a quick start for remote power generation at sea with the inclusion of CCS to serve offshore oil and gas operations. This calls for modular power blocks made up by high efficient combined power cycles with post-combustion exhaust gas cleaning. From this point of view a system with four absorption columns and one desorber unit has been determined based on structured packing material. The capture process has been integrated with the power cycle in due consideration of the sea forces. It is shown that a permanent tilt becomes more important than periodic movements provided the harmonic periods are kept within a certain level (<20 s). Operational conditions and constraints vis-A-vis movements and trimming of the floater have been addressed and discussed with reference to available literature. This also includes the liquid hold-up and gas-liquid interfacial area in the absorption columns linked with tilting. Optimisation reveals that a reboiler duty of 3.77 GJ/ton CO2 would result in the lowest capture cost. With a energy penalty of 9%-points the Sevan GTW concept presents itself as a realistic concept deemed to be within reach today. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

At Leeds, we possess research expertise across each of these domains and we have an established record of working across disciplinary boundaries. This proposal builds upon this record through the establishment of a multidisciplinary CDT in Fluid Dynamics. Research techniques that will be applied, and developed, will encompass: mathematical modelling & theory; numerical methods, CFD & high performance computing (HPC); and measurement & experimentation. Engineering application areas to be addressed include: reacting flows; carbon capture, transport & storage; flow of polymer melts; mixing problems; particulate flows; coating & deposition; lubrication; medical devices; pathogen control; heat transport; wind turbines; fluid-structure interaction; and nuclear safety. Environmental application areas will consist of: groundwater flow; river/estuary flows; tidal flows; oceanography; atmospheric pollution; weather forecasting; climate modelling; dynamics of the Earth's interior; and solar & planetary flow problems. Facilities available to undertake this research include: the University's HPC system which, combined with the N8 regional facility that is hosted at Leeds, provides ~10000 computational cores, an extensive suite of licensed software and dedicated support staff; flow measurement techniques (including Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV), 2-component Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA), Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA) and Ultrasonic Doppler Velocity Profiling (UDVP)); techniques for measuring fluid concentration (Ultrasonic High Concentration Meter (UHCM) and Optical Backscatter Probes (OBS)) and a range of optical metrology systems (e.g. pulsed and continuous wave lasers).The UK has a substantial requirement for doctoral scientists and engineers who have a deep understanding of all aspects of fluid dynamics from theory through to experimental methods and numerical simulation. In manufacturing and process engineering, for example, many processes depend critically on fluid flows (e.g. extrusion of polymer melts, deposition of coatings, spray drying, etc.) and it is essential to understand and control these processes in order to optimize production efficiency and reliability (see letter of support from P&G for example). In large-scale mechanical engineering there is a demand for expertise in reacting turbulent flows in order to optimize fuel efficiency and engine performance, and in wetting and surface flows for the design and manufacture of pumps and filters. There is also a need for a wide variety of skilled experts in environmental fluid flows to support the growing need to understand and predict local pollution and threats to safety (atmospheric, surface water, ocean and sub-surface flows), and to predict weather, climate and space weather for satellite technology.We will train a new generation of researchers who will have a broad range of skills to transfer into industry and environmental agencies, hence our approach will be multi-disciplinary throughout. All students will undertake both modelling and experimental training before embarking on their PhD project - which will be co-supervised by academics from different Schools. The MSc component of the programmee will be specifically tailored to develop expertise in the mathematical background of fluid dynamics, in CFD/HPC, and in experimental techniques. Team-based projects will be used to develop the teamwork and communication skills we believe are essential. Finally, engagement with industry will be a key feature of this CDT: all students will undertake an industrial placement, a large number of projects will be industrially sponsored, and our non-academic partners will contribute actively to our management, implementation and strategic development.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/L01615X/1,,,,,,,,University of Leeds,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15369113,,

Although infaunal organisms can be expected to be particularly impacted by decreases in seawater pH, as a result of naturally acidified conditions in benthic habitats, information regarding physiological and behavioral responses is still scarce. Determination of P-O2 and P-CO2 gradients within burrows of the brittlestar Amphiura filiformis during environmental hypercapnia demonstrated that besides hypoxic conditions, increases of environmental P-CO2 are additive to the already high P-CO2 (up to 0.08 kPa) within the burrows. In response to up to 4 weeks exposure to pH 7.3 (0.3 kPa P-CO2) and pH 7.0 (0.6 kPa P-CO2), metabolic rates of A. filiformis were significantly reduced in pH 7.0 treatments, accompanied by increased ammonium excretion rates. Gene expression analyses demonstrated significant reductions of acid-base (NBCe and AQP9) and metabolic (G6PDH, LDH) genes. Determination of extracellular acid-base status indicated an uncompensated acidosis in CO2-treated animals, which could explain the depressed metabolic rates. Metabolic depression is associated with a retraction of filter feeding arms into sediment burrows. Regeneration of lost arm tissues following traumatic amputation is associated with significant increases in metabolic rate, and hypercapnic conditions (pH 7.0, 0.6 kPa) dramatically reduce the metabolic scope for regeneration, reflected in an 80% reduction in regeneration rate. Thus, the present work demonstrates that elevated seawater P-CO2 significantly affects the environment and the physiology of infaunal organisms like A. filiformis.",,,,,,,,,30,2,0,0,27,0,34,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Gothenburg, Sven Loven Ctr Marine Sci, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, S-45178 Fiskebackskil, SwedenAcad Sinica, Inst Cellular & Organism Biol, Taipei 115, Taiwan",,,,2014-08-15,WOS:000339272900031,24737772,

Here we evaluated the influence of the spatial configuration of seagrass meadows at small scales (metres) on carbon storage in seagrass sediments. We intensively sampled carbon stocks and other geochemical properties (delta C-13, particle size, depositional fluxes) across seagrass-sand edges in a Zostera muelleri patchy seagrass landscape. Carbon stocks were significantly higher (ca. 20%) inside seagrass patches than at seagrass-sand edges and bare sediments. Deposition was similar among all positions and most of the carbon was from allochthonous sources. Patch level attributes (e.g. edge distance) represent important determinants of the spatial heterogeneity of carbon stocks within seagrass ecosystems. Our findings indicate that carbon stocks of seagrass areas have likely been overestimated by not considering the influence of meadow landscapes, and have important relevance for the design of seagrass carbon stock assessments.

Of particular concern are subsea export and intra-array cables, failure of which can lead to significant loss of generation and repair costs. In offshore wind farms, such failures are reported to account for 75-80% of the total cost of insurance claims, while total cabling expenditure accounts for only around 9% of the capital cost of a new windfarm. Significantly enhanced protection and monitoring systems are required to ensure robustness of these key assets and minimise lost generation in the event of a fault, but no existing instrumentation solution provides the required visibility at low cost to implement such a system.This project will deliver the required innovative solution, built around unique photonic sensor technology developed by UK SME Synaptec Ltd, enabling for the first time cost-effective distributed electrical instrumentation of offshore systems. The technology will enable robust differential protection schemes to be deployed on array cabling for immediate identification of the affected section in the event of a cable fault, significantly reducing associated generation downtime and loss-of-revenue. The wealth of information leveraged using this technology can further be used for harmonic measurements, which can be used to identify cable resonance conditions known to weaken insulation. Combined with compatible fibre-optic temperature measurement on known points of failure to detect hotspots, this would enable for the first time prediction of cable failure on an integrated platform, allowing swift contingency actions to be taken to reduce the risk of failure or plan ahead for repairs, enabling lifetime extension through targeted maintenance.ORE Catapult will contribute engineering and market expertise, and enable Synaptec to test the subsea cable monitoring/protection platform developed in this project in a realistic environment on OREC's 7MW test turbine in Levenmouth, Fife. Logging of measurement and system data during the trial will allow the long-term stability of Synaptec's sensors installed in offshore environments to be assessed for the first time. Synaptec and OREC will examine this wealth of data to determine what ancillary information can be obtained beyond basic faulted cable detection functionality, e.g. power quality measurements and failure prognostics based on harmonic information. OREC will leverage its expertise in and contacts throughout the offshore renewables sector to produce a commercial case and organise stakeholder workshops to ensure the technology developed by this project accurately addresses the industry need.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,105009,,,,,,,,Synaptec Ltd,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15348117,,

In the nearshore, waterborne techniques are compromised as search tools as their effective swath is a function of water depth, necessitating very close survey line spacing in shallow water, increasing cost accordingly. Additionally, in turbid coastal waters bathymetric LiDAR is ineffective as it relies on clear non-turbid water. Therefore, the nearshore turbid zone represents a challenging area for archaeologists in the search for fully submerged archaeological sites. In this study, we describe a new methodology to detect the presence of submerged shipwrecks using ocean colour satellite imagery in turbid waters. We demonstrate that wrecks generate Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) concentration signals that can be detected by high-resolution ocean colour satellite data such as Landsat-8. Surface SPM plumes extend downstream for up to 4 km from wrecks, with measured concentrations ranging between 15 and 95 mg/l. The overall ratio between the plume and background SPM concentrations is about 1.4. During slack tidal phases sediments in suspension settle to create fluffy mud deposits near the seabed. Scour pits developed around wrecks act as sinks where fine-grained suspended material is preferentially deposited at slacks. The scour pits subsequently act as sources for suspended material when the bottom current increases after slacks. SPM plumes develop immediately before maximum ebb or flood current is reached, during maximum current and immediately after. Particulate matter is suspended in sufficient concentrations to be detected in ocean colour data. The ability to detect submerged shipwrecks from satellite remote sensors is of benefit to archaeological scientists and resource managers interesting in locating wrecks and investigating processes driving their evolution.

Environmental assessments for oil and gas projects in the region predict insignificant adverse effects on marine birds from oil spills, incineration in platform flares and collisions. Limited baseline data on seasonal occupancies and a failure to quantify the nature and extent of marine bird attraction to platforms and related mortality undermines these assessments. We conducted 22 surveys to offshore platforms on the Grand Bank during 1999-2003 to measure avian associations with platforms and to determine the level of monitoring needed to assess the risks to marine birds. We document seasonal shifts in marine bird occurrences and higher densities of auks (fall) and shearwaters (summer) around platforms relative to surrounding areas. The limited temporal and spatial coverage of our surveys is more robust than existing industry monitoring efforts, yet it is still inadequate to quantify the scale of marine bird associations with platforms or their associated mortality risks. Systematic observations by independent biologists on vessels and platforms are needed to generate reliable assessments of risks to marine birds. Instead, the regulatory body for offshore oil and gas in eastern Canada (Canada - Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board; C-NLOPB) supports industry self-reporting as the accepted form of environmental monitoring. Conflicting responsibilities of oil and gas regulatory agencies for both energy development and environmental monitoring are major barriers to transparency, unbiased scientific inquiry and adequate environmental protection. Similar conflicts with the oil and gas regulatory body in the United States, the former Minerals and Management Service (MMS) were identified by the U.S. President as a major contributor to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The MMS has since been restructured into the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, (BOEM) with separate departments responsible for drilling leases and the regulation of drilling activities. Similar restructuring of the oil and gas regulatory bodies in Canada is needed for better public information, scientific investigation and environmental protection in the offshore.

In the present study, we examined how elevated CO2 affects various intertidal epibenthic (benthic copepod), intertidal endobenthic (Manila clam and Venus clam), sub-tidal benthic (brittle starfish), and free-living (marine medaka) organisms in areas expected to be impacted by leakage. Acute lethal and sub-lethal effects were detected in the adult stage of all test organisms exposed to varying concentrations of CO2, due to the associated decline in pH (8.3 to 5.2) during 96-h exposure. However, intertidal organisms (such as benthic copepods and clams) showed remarkable resistance to elevated CO2, with the Venus clam being the most tolerant (LpH(50) = 5.45). Sub-tidal species (such as brittle starfish [LpH(50) = 6.16] and marine medaka [LpH(50) = 5.91]) were more sensitive to elevated CO2 compared to intertidal species, possibly because they have fewer defensive capabilities. Of note, the exposure duration might regulate the degree of acute sub-lethal effects, as evidenced by the Venus clam, which showed a time-dependent effect to elevated CO2. Finally, copper was chosen as a model toxic element to find out the synergistic or antagonistic effects between ocean acidification and metal pollution. Combination of CO2 and Cu exposure enhances the adverse effects to organisms, generally supporting a synergistic effect scenario. Overall, the significant variation in the degree to which CO2 adversely affected organisms (viz., working range and strength) was clearly observed, supporting the general concept of species-dependent effects of elevated CO2.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,12,0,13,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,,,,,,,"Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 08826, South KoreaSeoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Oceanog, Seoul 08826, South KoreaAnyang Univ, Dept Marine Biotechnol, Ganghwagun, Incheon, South KoreaKorea Inst Ocean Sci & Technol, Ocean Circulat & Climate Res Ctr, Ansan, South KoreaKorea Res Inst Ships & Ocean Engn, Offshore CCS Res Unit, Daejeon, South Korea",,,,2016-08-01,WOS:000380369900025,27074931,

The aim of this study was to analyze how disturbance-induced changes in plant species abundance patterns account for variations in annual CO2 sequestration flow (CS) of Mediterranean sand dune areas. Two sites characterized by a high (site HAD) and a lower (site LAD) anthropogenic disturbance level were selected. At both sites, plant species number, cover, height and CS based on net photosynthesis measurements were sampled. At the plant species level, our results highlighted that Ammophila arenaria and Pancratium maritimum, had a key role in CS. Moreover, the results revealed a patchy species assemblage in both sites. In particular, HAD was characterized by a higher extension of the anthropogenic aphytoic zone (64% of the total transect length) than LAD. In spite of the observed differences in plant species composition, there were not significant differences between HAD and IAD in structural and functional traits, such as plant height and net photosynthesis. As a consequence, HAD and LAD had a similar CS (443 and 421 Mg CO2 ha(-1) y(-1), respectively). From a monetary point of view, our estimates based on the social costs of carbon revealed that the flow of sequestered CO2 valued on an average $ 3181 +/- 114 ha(-1) year(-1) (mean value for the two sites). However, considering also the value of the CO2 negative flow related to loss of vegetated area, the annual net benefit arising from CO2 sequestration amounted to $ 1641 and $ 1772 for HAD and LAD, respectively. Overall, the results highlighted the importance to maximize the efforts to preserve dune habitats by applying an effective management policy, which could allow maintaining also a regulatory ecosystem service such as CO2 sequestration.

Initiation of this response coincides with the onset of the carbon isotope excursion (CIE) but precedes the benthic foraminiferal mass extinction. The top-to-bottom'' succession in the biotic response indicates that the surface ocean/atmosphere was affected before the deep sea. The earliest stage of the faunal response entailed a conspicuous turnover within the shallow-dwelling genus Acarinina and a succession of stratigraphic first appearances. The genus Morozovella, large (>180 mum) biserial planktonics, and A. wilcoxensis are all restricted to the lower CIE within this PETM section. Acarininid populations crashed as the ocean/climate system ameliorated during the CIE recovery, reflecting atypical surface water conditions. This transient decline in acarininids is paralleled by a marked increase in carbonate content of sediments.

The Convention shall enter into force twelve months after having been signed and approved by ten States. The new Convention will provide a legal frame for the States Parties in removing existing and future wrecks located beyond the territorial sea (within their sovereign rights). First of all it is the exclusive economic zone which we discuss in the paper, or if a state has not established the Zone, it is the territory just beyond the territorial seas which extends not more than 200 NM from the starting lines for determining the size of territorial seas. Although the number of maritime accidents has been reduced recently, it has been estimated that there are more than 1 300 abandoned wrecks around the world today that pose potential hazards to safe navigation, utilization of the living resources, as well as to the marine environment. In accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Republic of Croatia established Protected Ecological and Fishing Zone comprising sovereign rights characteristic for exclusive economic zones such as sovereign right of researching, utilization and conservation of the living resources beyond the outer borders of the territorial sea, as well as their management, and the jurisdiction with regard to the scientific research of the sea and protection and preservation of the marine environment. The Adriatic Sea falls into the category of closed or semi-closed seas by the definition of the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea, and therefore if compared with larger seas, the consequences of pollution would be much greater due to its small size.That is why the adoption of the Convention on the Removal of Wrecks is of great importance to Croatia. The provisions of the Convention oblige the master and the operator of a ship to notify the endangered state party immediately about the accident which may cause a shipwreck, and the state must inform the mariners and other coastal states about the hazard posed by wrecks. The most important fact is that the Convention requires compulsory security for vessels of 300BT. The vessels of 300 BT are obliged to have the certificate of insurance, or some other financial security as a cover for owner's liability for the damage caused by the removal of the wreck.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1848-3305,1848-3313,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Split, Fac Maritime Studies, Split, CroatiaAdriat Inst Croatian Acad Sci & Arts, Zagreb, Croatia",Adriat Inst Croatian Acad Sci & Arts,,,2013-04-01,WOS:000437565500007,,

Heavy fuel oil (HFO) is a traditional marine fuel but alternative marine fuels such as MGO and LNG shall be considered for future researches on CO2 shipping because low sulphur content fuel is required in sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) from January 2015. However, LNG has not been seriously considered as a marine fuel for CO2 carriers and its economic feasibility has not been studied so far. This paper assesses economics of LNG fueled CO2 carriers based on a CO2 shipping scenario in North Sea and fuel price in June 2016. Parameter studies are conducted to understand the influence of important parameters such as a marine fuel price, LNG fuel system cost, and small LNG distribution cost. The results show that LNG fueled CO2 carriers are more cost-effective than CO2 carriers utilizing MGO based on fuel price in June 2016 and when crude oil price is higher than approximately 30-50 USD/bbl. Furthermore, technology development on LNG fuel system and bunkering infrastructure could strengthen the competitiveness of LNG as a marine fuel for CO2 carriers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Soon afterwards, hurricane Juliette hit the area with strong winds and water movement, disturbing the reef again. After that, three zones could be observed in the reef: one directly impacted by the shipwreck, one indirectly impacted by the hurricane, which moved and accumulated the coral debris left by the shipwreck, and the third one, which was not impacted. Later, a monitoring program was established to determine the degree of recovery of macroalgal assemblages in both impacted zones compared with the non-impacted one.Methods: From February 2005 to December 2007, macroalgae were collected seasonally by scuba divers in the three zones. In each zone, three to five thalli of all conspicuous algae, five rocks and five fragments of dead coral covered with macroalgal turfs were collected. Species number and composition of macroalgae assemblages were compared between zones and between years.Key results: A total of 117 species were found, 70 belonged to the phylum Rhodophyta, 25 to Ochrophyta-Phaeophyceae, and 22 to Chlorophyta. Macroalgal species richness and composition of the impacted zones were not different from the control zone, even between years.Conclusions: Macroalgal assemblages in the San Lorenzo Channel coral reef were able to recover, regardless of the modification of the substrate caused by the stranding and the hurricane Juliette in 2001. Therefore, it is important to implement monitoring efforts in case of anthropogenic or natural disturbance to document the extension of damage, recovery of the communities, and propose mitigation strategies if necessary.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,,,,2448-7589,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, Av Inst Politecn Nacl S-N, La Paz 23096, Baja Calif Sur, MexicoCtr Invest Biol Noroeste CIBNOR, Calle IPN 195, La Paz 23096, Baja Calif Sur, Mexico",,,,2020-07-03,WOS:000541528400001,,

This work investigated offshore Gas-To-Wire comprising processing of natural gas with high carbon dioxide content, power generation, post-combustion carbon capture and enhanced oil recovery. Supersonic separator is proposed for three applications: fuel-gas conditioning, fuel-gas decarbonation and pioneering dehydration of supercritical carbon dioxide. Economic analysis, including offshore rig and electricity transmission, results in positive Net Present Value with 20% of return-on-investment, besides a Levelized Cost of Energy comparable to onshore power plants with carbon capture and storage. Sensitivity analysis shows high impact of electricity-price and oil recovery yield on profitability, as well as better economic performance when carbon dioxide is not removed from fuel-gas; i.e., all carbon capture should be post combustion capture. Thus, despite effectiveness of supersonic separator for fuel-gas decarbonation, the 612 MW optimized Gas-To-Wire with carbon capture plant should have 100% of carbon removal via post-combustion, resulting in 38.3% return-on-investment and even better Levelized Cost of Energy similar to onshore power plants without carbon capture.",,,,,"13th Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems (SDEWES)13th Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems (SDEWES)","SEP 30-OCT 04, 2018SEP 30-OCT 04, 2018",,"Palermo, ITALYPalermo, ITALY",25,0,0,0,0,0,25,,,0196-8904,1879-2227,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Escola Quim, CT, Ilha Fundao, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",,,,2019-09-05,WOS:000482244300103,,

As an important economic macroalga, Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis has the potential to significantly affect carbon absorption and storage in wave-sheltered intertidal reef systems. However, detailed knowledge on seasonal biomass changes and carbon storage of G. lemaneiformis is lacking, especially in many small and scattered ecosystems. Considering the influence of human activities on wild distribution of G. lemaneiformis, the understanding of seasonal dynamics of an economically important species in nature is necessary. In this study, we first investigated seasonal variations in biomass, coverage area, and carbon storage during low tide from August 2011 to July 2012 in Zhanshan Bay, Qingdao, China. Furthermore, we estimated the carbon storage potential of wild G. lemaneiformis using light use efficiency (LUE). The results show that the standing biomass and coverage area changed significantly with season. However, seasonal variations in carbon content and water content were not obvious, with an average content of 35.1% and 83.64%, respectively. Moreover, carbon storage in individual months varied between 0.67 and 47.03 g C/m(2), and the value of carbon storage was the highest in August and June and the lowest in February. In Zhanshan Bay, LUE of G. lemaneiformis was only 0.23%. If it is increased to the theoretical maximum (5%-6%), the carbon storage will have an increase of at least 21 times compared with the current, which suggested that carbon storage of wild G. lemaneiformis had a high enhancement potential.

Newly developed cryogenic sediment sampling techniques combined with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy (LTSEM) protocols developed for the analysis of biological materials now permits the sampling of fully hydrated bottom sediments while preserving the structural integrity of the sampled material. This enables the direct observation of the sediment fabric as it exists at the seabed and the examination of delicate biological structures that are normally obliterated or distorted by the removal of water required for standard SEM preparation. This paper demonstrates the value of LTSEM and shows variation in microfabric structure between a station located on a spoil heap below an oil rig and a more remote (400 m distant) station. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) was also conducted on the frozen samples and provided support for the qualitative differences found between the two sites. The results suggest that an organic film was more pervasive on the drill spoil heap and that biological activity in the form of foraminifera was much more extensive on the remote site. Insufficient data has yet been collected to allow statistical analysis of the results, but the paper provides the first microfabric analyses of submerged spoil sediments using LTSEM and confirms the potential of this technique in terms of environmental assessment and analysis of the nature of the sediment fabric of oily, drill spoil heaps from a location in the North Sea.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,,,,,,,"Univ St Andrews, Gatty Marine Lab, Sch Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Sediment Ecol Res Grp, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland",,,,1999-06-15,WOS:000080965800005,,

We employed a large-scale experimental rocky reef system to examine patterns of recruitment of 2 fishes, the California sheephead Semicossyphus pulcher and the blackeye goby Rhinogobiops nicholsii. We quantified recruitment over a 2 yr period on 21 experimental reefs (each 1600 m(2)) that represented low, medium, and high treatments of habitat coverage. Recruitment of California sheephead was higher on reefs of medium habitat coverage than on reefs with other coverages, while the blackeye goby exhibited lower recruitment on reefs of low coverage than on reefs with other coverages. Within reefs, recruitment to 'edge' habitat was lower than 'inside' the reef for each species. At the smallest scale, several measures of habitat structure were quantified within 1 m(2) quadrats to identify microhabitat characteristics that might explain the distribution of recruits. Rugosity was an important characteristic for predicting the presence of recruits for each species at this small scale. The densities of recruits of California sheephead among treatments of habitat corresponded to the densities of Age 1+ (individuals which recruited during the previous year) california sheephead among treatments the following year, suggesting that spatial patterns of abundance may be established early in life. The abundance of predators did not appear to influence the patterns of recruitment observed for either species. Low densities of recruits for each species may have led to the patterns of recruitment observed through the processes of habitat selection at settlement and density-independent mortality.

The deterioration in water quality (chronic and catastrophic) from land and sea-based activities (especially industrial, agricultural, urban and domestic sewage run-off and mining activities including the oil and gas sector), eutrophication and harmful algal blooms have been identified as a major transboundary environmental problem by the countries in the adopted Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA). Arising from the results of the various environmental and socio-economic studies and assessments conducted over the years as documented in the Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA), the countries resolved to adopt a holistic, multi-sectoral and regional approach embodied in the large marine ecosystem concept for transboundary pollution management in the region. The agreed management actions to be undertaken jointly by the sixteen countries are encapsulated in the adopted Strategic Action Programme to be implemented by the Interim Guinea Current Commission (and later the Guinea Current Commission), established by the countries as an intergovernmental consultation and coordination body, with the technical assistance and co-funding of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

Our aim was to show whether sponge larvae with different behaviours exhibit different dispersal strategies under variable intensity of water movements. We first assessed the distribution of larvae of six taxa: Dictyoceratida spp., Dysidea avara, Crambe crambe, Phorbas tenacior, Scopalina lophyropoda, and Cliona viridis, collected through plankton sampling, and the abundance of the corresponding adult sponges across three hard bottom communities and a sandy bottom from a north-west Mediterranean rocky shore. We then tested adult-larvae couplings (abundance of larvae vs abundance of adults) under increasing levels of water movements (surge) to assess the importance of this environmental factor in driving differences in dispersal strategies. Adults of Dictyoceratida spp., D. avara, and P. tenacior were most abundant in semi-dark caves (SDC), C. crambe and C. viridis in communities of sciaphilic algae (SA), whereas the distribution of S. lophyropoda was extremely patchy, being present almost only in the SA community of one of the five stations studied. Larvae of Dictyoceratida spp. and P. tenacior were more abundant in the SDC, whereas D. avara and C. crambe were homogeneously distributed across the communities. The larvae of C. viridis were more abundant in the SA communities and the S. lophyropoda larvae were mostly present in one station and one community (SA). Increased water movement did not modify the adult-larvae coupling for Dictyoceratida spp., D. avara, and C. crambe, whereas it broke up the positive association for P. tenacior and to some extent S. lophyropoda. For C. viridis, possible variability in adult-larvae coupling was not tested because the larvae were collected on only one day under calm sea conditions. We confirm that efficient-swimming larvae with some cue response can actively counteract hydrodynamic forces and highlight the importance of both larval behaviour and environmental conditions in determining small-scale patterns of dispersal.",,,,,,,,,66,0,0,0,61,0,70,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,,,,,,,"CSIC, Ctr Estudis Avancats Blanes, Blanes 17300, SpainUniv Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim Invertebrats, Dept Biol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain",,,,2006-08-01,WOS:000240338500020,16710659,

The most abundant organisms by far in marine sediments are prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), and the biomass of the bacteria and archaea is so great that they are thought to be the main agents of the remineralisation of organic matter, a process which releases nutrients back into the water column and is thus very important for ocean productivity and, for example, fisheries. But our knowledge of deep-sea prokaryote diversity and ecosystem function is scarce. With fishing, mining, oil and gas exploration increasingly taking place in deeper waters, we urgently need to improve our understanding of the functioning of deep-sea ecosystems in order to assess appropriately the societal and economic implications of such activities and impacts and to ensure adequate management of deep-sea biodiversity and natural resources for future generations.Unfortunately, this is not easy: the main reasons for our limited knowledge of deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystem functioning lies in the combination of its inaccessibility with the sensitivity to depressurization of deep-sea organisms and deep-sea biogeochemical processes.

A decision support tool based on the voyage-based model has been used by planners in Statoil, and cost savings from this was estimated to approximately 3 million USD/year. Weather conditions at the Norwegian continental shelf can be harsh; wave heights may limit both an OSV's sailing speed and the time to perform unloading/loading operations at the installations. Hence, we analyze the weather impact on the execution of a schedule and propose robustness approaches to obtain solutions that can better withstand delays due to rough weather.

However, few empirical studies provide quantitative evidence for how ecosystem service trade-offs in forests persist over longer timeframes. Here, we examine the long-term recovery of multiple ecosystem services following harvest of old-growth forest stands on Vancouver Island, BC, Canada. We used a novel 212-year forest chronosequence approach to estimate recovery of a coastal temperate forest's capacity to provide eight ecosystem services. We examined: wood volume, carbon storage for climate regulation, potential nesting habitat for an old-growth associate bird species the marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus), coarse woody debris, habitat provided by standing dead trees, large heritage trees, wild edible berries, and large redcedar (Thuja plicata) trees used traditionally by First Nations for carving canoes and totem poles. Ecosystem service recovery trajectories followed u-shaped or s-shaped trajectories with varying times to reach old-growth conditions. Some services remained high post-harvest (e.g., habitat services of coarse woody debris) or recovered quickly in the first 100 years (e.g., carbon storage). However, cultural ecosystem services such as the large cedar trees used in traditional First Nations carving, had 200+ year delays in recovery. Our empirically-derived ecosystem services recovery trajectories demonstrate the complexity of long-term dynamics of harvest tradeoffs and help identify strengths and limitations of management approaches for sustaining multiple forest ecosystem services.

Traditionally Ieodo has been an special concern to korean people, as the rock had been told as an utopia to fishermen wrecked in a storm. The fact that Ieodo is really present was ascertained in 1900 when a british ship called Socotra found the rock.Ieodo is not an island which could has territorial sea, EEZ, and continental shelf around itself. According to the LOS Convention, Ieodo is neither a rock nor a low-tide elevation. It is only a submerged rock which any country could not claim sovereignty and establish maritime zones. What is certain is that the underwater rock is within Korea's maritime jurisdiction.South Korea established a multi-purpose comprehensive Marine Scientific Research Station(installation) over the Ieodo in 2003. That installation could provide many kinds of useful informations on the ocean and weather forecasting, maritime traffic safety and disaster prevention by monitoring the marine conditions in real time. Regarding to the building of that Marine Scientific Research Station of Ieodo, China has contested that the location of the station is in the disputed area between Korea and China.The East China Sea resource controversy is one of the most contentious elements of international conflicts in maritime boundaries. Geographically, this semi-enclosed sea is surrounded by the continents including Korea, China, and Japan with irregular coasts and islands of all possible sizes, locations, and economic utilities.China claimed that East China Sea continental shelf is a single continental shelf as a whole which is originated from main land of China. China stressed the geographical characteristics of the continental shelf of the East China Sea should be considered as a relevant circumstance in maritime delimitation. And China claimed that delimitation of continental shelf in the East China Sea should be settled by consultation between the parties on the basis of the theory of natural prolongation of land territory.Regarding to the delimitation of continental shelf in the East China Sea, Korea has suggested the median line as a general rule on the legal basis of the delimitation of continental shelf and rejected China's natural prolongation principle.Although some chinese NGOs have raised territorial claim over Ieodo, Chinese Government has never raised such claim over this tiny submerged rock. Given the fact that Ieodo is not entitled to maritime jurisdiction such as territorial sea, EEZ, and continental shelf, china's protest against Korea's maritime jurisdiction over Ieodo and its surrounding area seems to be related to the natural resources which may be found in the future. Which means that it is not a simple problem for Korea to neglect never. Besides keeping an eye on the maritime jurisdiction relating to exploitation and exploration of natural resources, the sensitiveness of location of Ieodo and Marine Scientific Research Station should not be ignored. For Ieodo is situated in a strategic point to watch Chinese navy's deployment into the Pacific Ocean, it can play an essential role in China's military acts and traffic routes over the countries along the Pacific Oceans costal.Many countries including China will give various their own opinions and interpretations about the new regime of law of the sea in the way that will do good for each country to ensure and strengthen their rights of the sea and these will remain a precedent effecting in the related fields in the future. Therefore, Korea should not only regard Ieodo just as a submerged rock, rather, need to make an effort to secure, rule and exercise maritime jurisdiction over Ieodo and it's surrounding area on legal and realistic aspects, continually.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1226-4148,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012-01-01,KJD:ART001664143,,

Within temperate estuaries in the southern hemisphere, especially Australia and New Zealand, the cordgrass Spartina spp. has become established. These species are highly invasive, and their prolific growth leads to the development of supratidal environments in formerly intertidal and subtidal environments. Here, we quantified the impact of Spartina invasion on the geomorphology and sequestration capacity of carbon in the sediments of Anderson Inlet, Victoria, Australia. Spartina was first introduced to the area in the 1930s to aid in land reclamation and control coastal erosion associated with coastal development. We found that Spartina now dominates the intertidal areas of the Inlet and promotes accretion (18mm/year) causing the formation of over 108ha of supratidal islands over the past 100years. These newly formed islands are calculated to potentially contain over 5.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent carbon. Future management of the inlet and other Spartina-dominated environments within Australian presents a dilemma for resource managers; on the one hand, Spartina is highly invasive and can outcompete native tidal marshes, thereby warranting its eradication, but on the other hand it is likely more resilient to rising sea levels and has the potential for carbon sequestration. Whether or not the potential advantages outweigh the significant habitat change that is anticipated, any management strategies will likely require additional research into costs and benefits of all ecosystem services provided by Spartina including in relation to nutrient cycling, shoreline stabilisation, and biodiversity as well as in response to the longevity of carbon found within the sediments.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,1745-5863,1745-5871,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Parkville, Vic, AustraliaUniv Melbourne, Natl Ctr Coasts & Climate, Parkville, Vic, AustraliaMonash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Clayton, Vic, AustraliaSch Life & Environm Sci, Fac Sci Engn & Built Environm, Clayton, Vic, AustraliaDeakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Fac Sci Engn & Built Environm, Burwood, Vic, Australia",Sch Life & Environm Sci,,,2018-02-20,WOS:000424830900008,,

The study region of the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) LTER is the southern sector of the California Current System (CCS), a major upwelling biome where the 67-year California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program provides essential information characterizing both natural climate variability and progressive changes. The CCE site spans a biogeographic boundary region, hence is an early sentinel of climate change; shows low frequency variations that are correlated with much of the North Pacific; is the preferred spawning site for most of the epipelagic fish biomass in the CCS; exhibits a broad gradient of ocean conditions over a short geographic distance; encompasses an undisturbed, layered sedimentary record of the past two millennia; and has well-developed models. The California Current Ecosystem (CCE) LTER program addresses two over-arching questions: What are the mechanisms leading to different ecosystem states in a coastal pelagic ecosystem? What is the interplay between changing ocean climate, community structure, and ecosystem dynamics? This program will develop a new quantitative basis for forecasting the effects of climate perturbations on the management of key living marine resources, including numerous fishes, invertebrates, marine mammals, and seabirds. The study region also affects CO2 exchange and carbon sequestration, as well as human recreation, navigation, and the livelihoods of large numbers of U.S. residents. The site encompasses a National Marine Sanctuary and constitutes major spawning habitat for most of the epipelagic fish biomass in the CCS. This research will involve extensive training of graduate students, undergraduate REU's, and will create teacher opportunities. Public programs and outreach efforts will be expanded in collaboration with the Birch Aquarium at Scripps, to increase public awareness and understanding of climate effects on coastal pelagic communities, to connect the public Phase II support of CCE led to extensive new findings: a new null hypothesis for abrupt ecosystem shifts, understanding of phenological changes in marine fish spawning, new roles for both Si- Fe interactions and mesopelagic fishes in mediating Carbon export, long-term changes in nutrient stoichiometry in upwelling source waters, eddy-mediated transformations of plankton production, and alterations of mesopelagic fishes in relation to ocean de-oxygenation. CCE studies of mesoscale frontal systems found marked effects of ocean fronts on organisms across the food web ranging from bacteria to marine fishes. Glider-based studies showed elevated phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass at frontal discontinuities and satellite studies showed that such frontal features are increasing in the CCE region. Several thousand people were reached through outreach activities. This award builds on the investigator's previous analyses of the mechanisms underlying abrupt changes in ecosystem state with three new program elements: (1) intensive analysis of cross-shore transport as a modulator of long-term ecosystem variation; (2) development of quantitative forecasts of the biotic effects of El Niño-Southern Oscillation; and (3) expansion of the ability to characterize ecosystem perturbations using molecular approaches. Multi-scale measurements of the five core LTER variables and their responses to secular ocean changes (warming, increased density stratification, de-oxygenation, and acidification) in the NE Pacific will be sustained. CCE-LTER studies are making excellent progress toward understanding ecological state changes and the development of a quantitative framework for forecasting future changes in ecosystem states in a major upwelling ecosystem. In this new award the investigators will conduct intensive shipboard Lagrangian process studies to test the role of cross-shore transport in exporting nutrients, other biogenic compounds, and organisms into the offshore zone, thereby modifying population dynamics and biogeochemical export. Climate sensitivity of cross-shore transport will be assessed using autonomous measurements and integrative modeling. Other mechanisms related to ecosystem transitions (in situ changes in stratification, alongshore advection, top down predation) will be analyzed, respectively, by field studies employing a space-for-time exchange, in situ and remote sensing measurements combined with modeling, and bioenergetic modeling. Collaborative studies will develop a new framework for forecasting ENSO effects on marine pelagic ecosystems along the U.S. west coast. Molecular approaches will be used to characterize trends in microbial diversity and associated plankton interactomes.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1637632,,,,,,,,University of California-San Diego Scripps Inst of Oceanography,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13814194,,

The objective was to study the effects of such leakage in the expected scenarios of pH values between 8.0 and 6.0. Polychaetes were exposed for 10 days to seawater with sediment samples collected in two different coastal areas, one with relatively uncontaminated sediment as reference (RSP) and the other with known contaminated sediment (ML), under pre-determined pH conditions. Survival and metal accumulation (Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, As and Hg) in the whole body of H. diversicolor were employed as endpoints. Mortality was significant at the lowest pH level in the sediment with highest metal concentrations. In general, metal concentrations in tissues of individuals exposed to the contaminated sediment were influenced by pH.

However, little is known about the location and characteristics of these particular formations. Here we provide comprehensive estimates of organic carbon (C-org) storage in Posidonia oceanica and Posidonia australis meadows, while providing insight into their location and mechanisms of formation, and highlighting future research directions. Erosional reef escarpments are restricted to shallow highly productive P. oceanica meadows from the Mediterranean Sea and P. australis meadows from the Indian Ocean, and sustain the existence of C-org-rich deposits in surrounding meadows. The thickness of the mat escarpments can reach up to 3 m and their length can vary from few to hundreds of meters. Mechanisms of formation appear to differ among sites, from naturally-induced escarpments by wave action and/or tidal flow to human-induced escarpments by dredging activities.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Geophysical Data Center (NOAA-NGDC) processes and archives nighttime lights data acquired by the U.S. Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS). Initially designed to detect moonlit clouds this sensor is equipped with a photomultiplier tube intensifying the visible band signal at night and enabling the detection of lights present at the surface of the earth. It thus provides up-to-date information on the location and impact zone of oil and gas producing facilities, heavily lit fishing boats and the artificial night sky brightness that can extend many kilometers out from urban settlements. Artificial night lighting represents a direct threat to marine ecosystems and is an excellent proxy measure for indirect impacts such as human associated chronic water pollution. A growing body of evidence indicates that artificial sky brightness is an important stressor for many marine organisms, including birds and fish. In this paper we present selected 'eco-applications' of nighttime Earth Observation including assessment of light pollution impact on coral reefs and sea turtles. Coral reefs are highly photosensitive, i.e. many species synchronize their spawning through detection of low light intensity from moonlight and reef structure is strongly influenced by illumination. Settlements and other artificial sources of lighting provide illumination brighter than the full moon, especially at shorter wavelengths. Seabirds are intimately linked with the light features of their environments since they are nocturnally active. On the Azores Islands a campaign was initiated reporting light-induced falls of marine birds. Results will be presented of taking these available in situ data as reference for analyzing spatial correlations of altered environmental conditions and actual impact cases.",,,,,ISPRS Technical Commission VII Symposium - 100 Years ISPRS - Advancing Remote Sensing ScienceISPRS Technical Commission VII Symposium - 100 Years ISPRS - Advancing Remote Sensing Science,"JUL 05-07, 2010JUL 05-07, 2010",ISPRSISPRS,"Vienna, AUSTRIAVienna, AUSTRIA",8,0,0,0,5,0,8,,,2194-9034,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Donau City Str 1, A-1220 Vienna, AustriaNatl Ocean Atmospher Adm, Natl Geophys Data Ctr, Boulder, CO 80305 USAUniv Colorado, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USAUniv Azores, Dept Biol, Azores, Portugal",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000339410200009,,

Various sizes of colonies were collected to determine the relationship between colony size and sexual maturity. The colonies smaller than 15 cm height did not contain gonads. Moreover, P. flabellata was a hermaphrodite species with gonads developed along with mesenteries. No planulae were observed in the samples investigated. Therefore, P. flabellata in Iran is most likely a broadcast spawener. The gonads were at the same developmental stages in each season. The results showed that spawning of P. flabellata probably occurred in July-August which is consistent with the suitable environmental conditions such as higher water temperature and long day-light. The present study indicated that P. flabellata exhibits a remarkably high reproductive potential, which contributes to its dominance in the artificial reef in Northwest of Persian Gulf. (C) 2012 PVJ.

The OHI framework can be used to assess marine areas at global or regional scales, but how various OHI goals should be weighted to reflect priorities at those scales remains unclear. In this study, we adapted the framework in two ways for application to Canada as a case study. First, we customized the OHI goals to create a national Canadian Ocean Health Index (COHI). In particular, we altered the list of iconic species assessed, added methane clathrates and subsea permafrost as carbon storage habitats, and developed a new goal, 'Aboriginal Needs', to measure access of Aboriginal people to traditional marine hunting and fishing grounds. Second, we evaluated various goal weighting schemes based on preferences elicited from the general public in online surveys. We quantified these public preferences in three ways: using Likert scores, simple ranks from a best-worst choice experiment, and model coefficients from the analysis of elicited choice experiment. The latter provided the clearest statistical discrimination among goals, and we recommend their use because they can more accurately reflect both public opinion and the trade-offs faced by policy-makers. This initial iteration of the COHI can be used as a baseline against which future COHI scores can be compared, and could potentially be used as a management tool to prioritise actions on a national scale and predict public support for these actions given that the goal weights are based on public priorities.",,,,,,,,,14,1,0,0,10,0,16,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Quebec Rimouski, Inst Sci Mer, Rimouski, PQ, CanadaUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USASimon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC, CanadaUniv Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ, CanadaStanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Stanford, CA 94305 USAImperial Coll London, Silwood Pk, Ascot, Berks, EnglandUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA USA",,,,2017-05-24,WOS:000402061500055,28542394,

The causes of salinization are diverse and include alterations to freshwater flows, land-clearance, irrigation, disposal of wastewater effluent, sea level rise, storm surges, and applications of de-icing salts. Climate change and anthropogenic modifications to the hydrologic cycle are expected to further increase the extent and severity of wetland salinization. Salinization alters the fundamental physicochemical nature of the soil-water environment, increasing ionic concentrations and altering chemical equilibria and mineral solubility. Increased concentrations of solutes, especially sulfate, alter the biogeochemical cycling of major elements including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, iron, and silica. The effects of salinization on wetland biogeochemistry typically include decreased inorganic nitrogen removal (with implications for water quality and climate regulation), decreased carbon storage (with implications for climate regulation and wetland accretion), and increased generation of toxic sulfides (with implications for nutrient cycling and the health/functioning of wetland biota). Indeed, increased salt and sulfide concentrations induce physiological stress in wetland biota and ultimately can result in large shifts in wetland communities and their associated ecosystem functions. The productivity and composition of freshwater species assemblages will be highly altered, and there is a high potential for the disruption of existing interspecific interactions. Although there is a wealth of information on how salinization impacts individual ecosystem components, relatively few studies have addressed the complex and often non-linear feedbacks that determine ecosystem-scale responses or considered how wetland salinization will affect landscape-level processes. Although the salinization of wetlands may be unavoidable in many cases, these systems may also prove to be a fertile testing ground for broader ecological theories including (but not limited to): investigations into alternative stable states and tipping points, trophic cascades, disturbance-recovery processes, and the role of historical events and landscape context in driving community response to disturbance.",,,,,,,,,525,21,0,0,386,3,598,,,2150-8925,,,,,,,,,,,"Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USAVictoria Univ, Inst Sustainabil & Innovat, Melbourne, Vic 8001, AustraliaUniv Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68506 USAVirginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USAE Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USANo Kentucky Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Highland Hts, KY 41099 USARadboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Aquat Ecol & Environm Biol, Inst Water & Wetland Res, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, NetherlandsFederat Univ Australia, Fac Sci & Technol, Mt Helen, Vic 3353, Australia",,,,2015-10-01,WOS:000364024300035,,

A text record is available for comment.The F124 format is used for data from sampling and analysis of marine zooplankton. Information on zooplankton abundance, distribution, and productivity derived from these data support studies of marine populations and ecosystems. Data reported may include: cruise information, position, date, and time of sampling; bottom depth, sampling depths, temperature, and salinity; gear type, volume of water filtered, total dry and wet weight, and other data for total haul; and data for subsamples by species. Data on zooplankton catch by species may include subsample size, zooplankton concentration, life history code, and numbers of adults, juveniles, eggs, and larvae. Estimated density of holoplankton and meroplankton and data on ichthyoplankton may also be reported. A text record is available for comments. Note: there are two options for reporting subsample counts of individuals at different life history stages. If life history codes are used, only number of adults should be reported on that record. Additional separate records should then be used to report number of juveniles and so on. Alternatively, life history codes may not be used and number of adults, juveniles, and so entered in the proper fields of a single record.The F127 format is used for data from field observations of marine animals. Data may be reported either for individual, random sightings or for sightings made as part of systematic ship or aircraft surveys along specified tracks. These data provide information on animal population densities and distributions, activities, migratory routes and breeding locales. Cruise or survey information, start and end positions, start and end times, and platform speed, direction, and altitude are reported for each observation or series of observations. Position, date and time are reported for each sighting location, along with a code indicating presence or absence of animals and, if present, their distance to the observer, shoreline, and ice edge and heading direction. For each sighting location, animal sighting data are reported by species for all observed species. Species identification, total number of individuals, and counts by age group (adults, subadults, juveniles, unknown) may be reported in summary for all animals sighted or by subgroups distinguished by sex, behavior, markings, or other characteristics. A text record is available for comments.The F132 format contains data from field sampling or surveys of bottom dwelling marine organisms. The data provide information on species abundance, distribution, and biomass; they may have been collected by point sampling (grab or core), by tow (dredge, trawl or net), by photographic surveys, or by other methods. Cruise information such as vessel, start and end dates, investigator, and institution/agency; station numbers, positions and times; and equipment and methods are reported for each survey. Environmental data reported at each sampling site may include meteorological and sea surface conditions; surface and bottom temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen; and sediment characteristics. Number of individual organisms and total weight of organisms is reported for each species. A text record is available for comments.The F144 format contains data on ambient concentrations of toxic substances and other pollutants in the marine environment. The data derive from laboratory analyses of samples of water, sediment, or marine organisms. Samples may have been collected near marine discharge sites or during ocean monitoring surveys of large areas. Field observations of tar deposits on beaches may also be reported. Survey information includes platform type, start and end dates, and investigator and institution. If data are collected near a discharge site, discharge location, depth, distance to shore, average volume, and other characteristics are reported. Position, date, time and environmental conditions are reported for each sample station. Environmental data may include meteorological and sea surface conditions, tide stage and height, depth of the thermocline or mixed layer surface temperature and salinity, and wave height and periods. Sample characteristics, collection methods, and laboratory techniques are reported for each sample collected and analyzed. The data record comprises concentration values (or a code to indicate trace amounts) for each chemical substance analyzed. Chemical substances are identified by codes based on the registry numbers assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) of the American Chemical Society. Marine organisms from which samples have been taken are identified using the 12-digit NODC Taxonomic Code. A text record is available for optional comments.The F156 format is used for time series data on ocean circulation determined by the tracking of drifting buoys, drogues, or other instrumented devices as they are carried with the flow. Movement is reported as point-to-point geographic locations determined by shore-based, surface ship, aircraft, or satellite observations. Data from both ocean currents and ice movement can be reported in this format over time periods ranging from minutes to months. Directions and speeds between individual observations may be computed from these data and presented in graphic or summary listing form to provide information on circulation patterns and mass transport in offshore and near- shore regions. Platform name (for platform acquiring data or deploying device), drogue characteristics, start and end positions and times, and observation frequency (if constant time interval) are reported for each series of observation. Other surface meteorological or oceanographic parameters (e.g., water temperature and salinity, air temperature and pressure, wind, waves) and subsurface data (depth, pressure, temperature) may also be reported. Text records may be used to report general comments or to describe individual drogue observations.The UBT format contains temperature-depth profile data obtained using expendable bathythermograph (XBT) instruments. Cruise information, position, date and time were reported for each observation. The data record are comprised of pairs of temperature-depth values. The XBT data files contain temperature values at non-uniform depths. These depths were recorded at the minimum number of points (inflection points) required to accurately define the temperature curve.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-23,DRCI:DATA2020233018200509,,

Scotland has a legacy of onshore and offshore pipelines, which transported methane from producing regions. These can be re-used to connect CO2 emitters to storage. Approximately 80% of large point-source CO2 emissions in Scotland are within 40 km of the Feeder 10 pipeline. Thirteen selected emitters are evaluated for potential CO2 capture volume, estimated capture project cost and cost of connection.

Quantitative estimates and multi-scale appraisals of sources that underlie long-term storage of sedimentary carbon are vital for understanding coastal carbon dynamics. Across a tropical-subtropical coastal continuum in the Western Indian Ocean, we estimated organic (C-org) and inorganic (C-carb) carbon stocks in seagrass sediment. Quantified levels and variability of the two carbon stocks were evaluated with regard to the relative importance of environmental attributes in terms of plant-sediment properties and landscape configuration. The explored seagrass habitats encompassed low to moderate levels of sedimentary C-org (ranging from 0.20 to 1.44% on average depending on species- and site-specific variability) but higher than unvegetated areas (ranging from 0.09 to 0.33% depending on site-specific variability), suggesting that some of the seagrass areas (at tropical Zanzibar in particular) are potentially important as carbon sinks. The amount of sedimentary inorganic carbon as carbonate (C-carb) clearly corresponded to C-org levels, and as carbonates may represent a carbon source, this could diminish the strength of seagrass sediments as carbon sinks in the region. Partial least squares modelling indicated that variations in sedimentary C-org and C-carb stocks in seagrass habitats were primarily predicted by sediment density (indicating a negative relationship with the content of carbon stocks) and landscape configuration (indicating a positive effect of seagrass meadow area, relative to the area of other major coastal habitats, on carbon stocks), while seagrass structural complexity also contributed, though to a lesser extent, to model performance. The findings suggest that accurate carbon sink assessments require an understanding of plant-sediment processes as well as better knowledge of how sedimentary carbon dynamics are driven by cross-habitat links and sink-source relationships in a scale-dependent landscape context, which should be a priority for carbon sink conservation.",,,,,,,,,95,1,0,0,66,2,99,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,,,,,,,"Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, SwedenUniv Dodoma, Sch Biol Sci, Box 338, Dodoma, TanzaniaUniv Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Reg Climate Grp, S-40530 Gothenburg, SwedenUniv Ottawa, Dept Geog, 60 Univ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, CanadaUniv Eduardo Mondlane, Dept Biol Sci, Maputo 1100, Mozambique",Univ Dodoma,,,2018-04-01,WOS:000428556200012,,

Whaling vessels operating from shore stations in Ireland in the early 20th century frequently caught sperm whales in oceanic waters. It is likely that this North Atlantic region contains important foraging habitats for this species, and that mature males must also migrate through this area moving between breeding grounds to the south and other feeding areas further north. Increasingly, these offshore waters are being utilised and potentially impacted by human industrial activities. For example, as inshore resources are depleted and technology improves, both the commercial fishing and the oil and gas industry are becoming more active in deeper waters beyond the continental margin. It is important therefore to better understand the biology and ecology of sperm whales in these more remote areas. However, their offshore location and deep diving habits, together with weather constraints in the exposed Atlantic, make research difficult. New sperm whale density estimates are reported using data from six seasonal passive acoustic surveys carried out in two successive years (2015 and 2016). These covered a corridor approximately 110km wide which bounded a major portion of Ireland's continental shelf break. Towed hydrophone line-transect methodologies were used, which have proven to be highly effective for surveying sperm whales in offshore waters and in poor weather conditions. Target motion analysis was applied to calculate the ranges of vocalising whales from the survey tracklines and the effective strip half-width calculated across all surveys was 7,958m. The study area was surveyed in three blocks and animal densities within these blocks varied between 1 and 4.6 individuals per 1,000km2 (CV 0.34 and 0.21 respectively) with an overall mean density in waters deeper than 300m of 3.2 individuals per 1,000km(2) (CV 0.04). These robust density estimates are the first of their kind for Irish waters and are similar to those reported in other Atlantic areas considered significant for this species. These results emphasise the significance of this region as sperm whale habitat. The results of this study should be used to inform the future sustainable development and management of Ireland's offshore Atlantic.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,6,0,8,,,1561-0713,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, UK",,,,2021-06-09,BCI:BCI202100545903,,

In contrast to classic reefs, these buildups were not able to form large accumulative landforms that changed the hydrodynamics and paleogeography of sedimentary basins. The results of this study allowed us to divide the Lower Permian carbonate buildups into two types: (1) skeletal mounds formed primarily by algae andPalaeoaplysinacommunities; (2) microbial mounds composed of microbial assemblages. Identification of these mounds based on seismic data usually does not meet any difficulties. However, their texture, peculiarities of reservoir distribution, and variations of their properties are often unreflected in the characteristics of seismic waves due to limitations of the seismic survey resolution.

Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Research (NEESR) competition and includes Texas A&M University (lead institution), the University of Connecticut and Prairie View A&M University (subawards). This project will utilize the NEES equipment site at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In the last few years, interest has been increasingly focused on alternative and renewable sources of energy. Wind energy as an alternative to fossil fuels is receiving close attention while the number megawatts produced has been rapidly increasing. In many locations in the United States and internationally, construction of onshore wind farms has raised environmental and aesthetic concerns. In addition, the terrestrial wind cycle and the daily energy use cycle are not well matched, with peak winds occurring when the energy demand is at its lowest, requiring the development of energy storage strategies and devices. On the other hand, offshore wind farm development can avoid most of the aesthetic issues, with the added benefit of stronger and sustained winds at lower heights and more aligned wind and usage cycles. The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the most effective foundation system for offshore wind towers by examining the performance of different systems when the structure is subjected to both wind and wave loading. Intellectual merit The project will carry out centrifuge testing in the NEES@Rensselaer facility. The testing program will focus on monopiles and suction caissons. Preliminary testing will be conducted using testbeds at Texas A&M University to evaluate the design of the tools and the models, as well as the sensors. The testing will be used to characterize the response of the foundations systems under a comprehensive range of loading conditions similar to those an offshore wind tower would be subjected to. Numerical analysis will be used to simulate the response of the tower-foundation-soil system with realistic soil models. The numerical and soil models will be validated against the testing. Broader impact The foundations currently used for offshore wind towers may not be the most effective solution for this application, especially in weaker soils. Foundation designs which evolved in the offshore oil and gas industry are not readily applicable to wind tower foundations offshore and design codes are not providing sufficient guidance for designers. Since foundations account for a significant part of the cost of offshore wind towers, choosing the most effective and most economical system will improve the viability of offshore wind energy generation. Undergraduate students from Prairie View A&M University, a Historically Black University, will work with the researchers at their campus, TAMU and UConn throughout the project. Additional undergraduate involvement will be promoted through summer REU experiences. Outreach efforts will be directed towards K-12 students, through demonstrations and teacher involvement in the research activities. The educational and outreach plan addresses diversity by promoting hand-on activities, increased interaction and integration of research and education, which have been effective in improving the retention of underrepresented groups in engineering. Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES data repository.

This study aims to address this knowledge gap at an adequate resolution to support national cetacean conservation and management planning. Maximum Entropy (Maxent) modelling was used to map the distribution of 15 selected cetacean species in seven areas within Indonesian waters using recent cetacean presence datasets as well as environmental predictors (topographic and oceanographic variables). We then combined the individual species suitable habitat maps and overlaid them with provincial marine spatial planning (MSP) jurisdictions, marine protected areas (MPAs), oil and gas contract areas, and marine traffic density. Our results reflect a great heterogeneity in distribution among species and within species among different locations. This heterogeneity reflects an interrelated influence of topographic variables and oceanographic processes on the distribution of cetacean species. Bathymetry, distance to-coast and -200m isobaths, and Chl and SST were important variables influencing distribution of most species in many regions. Areas rich in species were mainly related to high coastal or insular-reef complexity, representing high productivity and upwelling-modified waters. Although some important suitable habitats currently fall within MPAs, other areas are not and overlap with oil and gas exploration activities and marine traffic, indicating potentially high risk areas for cetaceans. The results of this study can support national cetacean conservation and management planning, and be used to reduce or avoid adverse anthropogenic threats.

Using a social network analysis method, network properties, network actors and cohesive subgroups were examined. The collaborative strength of patentees is also investigated, along with an analysis of the breadth and depth of technological collaboration. The results show that the overall collaboration network of CCS is still at an early stage of development; CCS enterprises and relevant R&D organizations have not established close partnerships.

Little is known of the effects of PFW on tropical marine organisms, especially keystone species. Exposing the coral Plesiastrea versipora to a range (3-50% v/v) of PFW from Harriet A oil platform resulted in a reduction in photochemical efficiency of the symbiotic dinoflagellate algae in hospite ( in the coral tissues), assessed as a decrease in the ratio of variable fluorescence (F-v) to maximal fluorescence (F-m) measured using chlorophyll fluorescence techniques. Significant differences were noted at PFW concentrations >12.5% ( v/v). In corals where F-v/F-m was significantly lowered by PFW exposure, significant discolouration of the tissues occurred in a subsequent 4-day observation period. The discolouration ( coral bleaching) was caused by a loss of the symbiotic dinoflagellates from the tissues, a known sublethal stress response of corals. PFW caused a significant decrease in F-v/F-m in symbiotic dinoflagellates freshly isolated from the coral Heliofungia actiniformis at 6.25% PFW, slightly lower than the studies in hospite.

In metabarcoding, a public sequence database is typically used to match barcodes to species identity, but these databases are naturally incomplete. The North Sea oil and gas industry conducts large-scale environmental monitoring programs in one of the most heavily sampled marine areas worldwide and could therefore be considered a best-case scenario for macrofaunal metabarcoding. As a test case, we investigated the database coverage of two common metabarcoding markers, mitochondrial COI and the ribosomal rRNA 18S gene, for a complete list of 1802 macrofauna taxa reported from the North Sea monitoring region IV. For COI, species level barcode coverage was 50.4% in GenBank and 42.4% for public sequences in BOLD. For 18S, species level coverage was 36.4% in GenBank and 27.1% in SILVA. To see whether rare species were underrepresented, we investigated the most commonly reported species as a separate dataset but found only minor coverage increases. We conclude that compared to global figures, barcode coverage is high for this area, but that a significant effort remains to fill barcode databases to levels that would make metabarcoding operational as a taxonomic tool, including for the most common macrofaunal taxa.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,25,0,28,,,1867-1616,1867-1624,,,,,,,,,,"NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr, Nygardsgaten 112, N-5008 Bergen, NorwayUniv Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 463, S-40530 Gothenburg, SwedenGothenburg Global Biodivers Ctr, POB 461, SE-40530 Gothenburg, SwedenNat Hist Museum, Life Sci Dept, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, EnglandUniv Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, POB 463, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",,,,2020-08-17,WOS:000560432400001,,

This 7-m-long marine sediment core spans the last similar to 7500 years, and we use it to test the hypothesis that marine productivity in the California Current System (CCS) driven by coastal upwelling has co-varied with Holocene millennial-scale warm intervals. A combination of biogenic sediment concentrations (opal, total organic C, and total N), stable isotopes (organic matter delta C-13 and bulk sedimentary delta N-15), and key microfossil indicators of upwelling were used to test this hypothesis. The record of biogenic accumulation in TN062-0550 shows considerable Holocene variability despite being located within 50 km of the mouth of the Eel River, which is one of the largest sources of terrigenous sediment to the Northeast Pacific Ocean margin. A key time interval beginning at similar to 2900 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP) indicates the onset of modern upwelling in the CCS, and this period also corresponds to the most intense period of upwelling in the last 7500 years. When these results are placed into a regional CCS context during the Holocene, it was found that the timing of upwelling intensification at TN062-0550 corresponds closely to that seen at nearby ODP Site 1019, as well as in the Santa Barbara Basin of southern California. Other CCS records with less refined age control show similar results, which suggest late Holocene upwelling intensification may be synchronous throughout the CCS. Based on the strong correspondence between the alkenone sea surface temperature record at ODP Site 1019 and the onset of late Holocene upwelling in northern California, we suggest that CCS warming may be conducive to upwelling intensification, though future changes are unclear as the mechanisms forcing SST variability may differ.

This paper follows the development of the zero discharge measure and analyzes what it implies for activities in the Barents Sea. Several uncertainties of precaution are discussed, which relate to technological issues, monitoring, compliance and unintended environmental consequences. Precautionary action should be scrutinized for its proportionality: how do the benefits of the measure relate to the technological, financial and environmental costs? It is concluded that the most (cost-) effective solutions that could lead to the lowest total environmental harm are not always the solutions that are most politically feasible.

No significant differences were observed in nematode total density, number of taxa and the overall assemblage structure between the control and impact treatments from before to after the experimental spill. This reinforces the idea that, despite being good indicators of environmental stress, free-living marine nematodes are able to tolerate low concentrations of hydrocarbons and to survive in moderately contaminated areas.

Seagrass meadows are important global blue carbon sinks. Despite a 30% loss of seagrasses globally during the last century, there is limited empirical research investigating the effects of disturbance and loss of seagrass on blue carbon stocks.2. In this study, we hypothesised that seagrass loss would reduce blue carbon stocks. Using shading cloth, we simulated small-scale die-offs of two subtropical seagrass species, Halodule wrightii and Thalassia testudinum, in a dynamic northern Gulf of Mexico lagoon. The change in quantity and quality of sediment organic matter (OM) and organic carbon was compared among die-off, control and bare plots before the die-off treatment, shortly after the die-off treatment and 11 months after the die-off treatment. Pb-210 age dating was performed on bare and Thalassia plots at 11 months to evaluate the impact of sediment erosion in the absence of vegetation.3. The small-scale die-off led to a 50%-65% OM loss in the sediment in the top 8 cm of Halodule plots. Thalassia plots lost significant portions of OM (50%) and organic carbon (C-org; 21%-47%) in only the top 1 cm of sediment. The Pb-210 profiles indicated Thalassia die-off reduced the C-org sequestration rate by 10%, in addition to a loss of c. 1 year's worth of C-org stocks (c. 22 g/m(2)). Furthermore, analyses on OM/C-org quality indicated a loss of labile OM/C-org and enhanced remineralisation by microbes.4.Synthesis and applications. This study provides empirical evidence that small-scale shading-induced seagrass die-offs can reduce seagrass carbon sequestration capacity and trigger losses of blue carbon stocks. While the losses recorded here are modest, these losses in blue carbon storage capacity are notable due to the proximity of shading structures (e.g. boat docks) to seagrass habitats. Thus, policies to avoid or protect seagrass habitats from common small-scale, shading disturbances are important for optimising both carbon sequestration capacity and coastline development and management.",,,,,,,,,40,2,0,0,25,0,45,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Technol Sydney, Climate Change Cluster, Ultimo, NSW, AustraliaDeakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Vic, AustraliaDauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL USAUniv S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL USAEdith Cowan Univ, Sch Sci, Joondalup, WA, AustraliaUniv Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Fis, Bellaterra, SpainUniv Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Bellaterra, SpainUniv Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, Sch Phys, Crawley, WA, AustraliaDeakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Burwood, Vic, Australia",,,,2018-04-27,WOS:000430059500029,,

It is important to conserve marine forest in order to protect coastal marine environments. A Marine Block comprised of steelmaking slag particles combined by CaCO(3) has several merits: (1) solidification of CO(2), (2) stability and safety, (3) porous materials covered with CaCO(3), (4) harmony with the seabed environment, (5) recycling of iron by-products, and (6) the ability to be mass produced in coastal ironworks. The objectives of this study were to observe the algal succession, the growth of Ecklonia cava and other attached organisms on Marine Blocks and concrete blocks compared to natural seaweed beds. In November 2001, five 1 m(3) Marine Blocks and five 1 m(3) concrete blocks were installed close to E. cava beds around the coastal frontage of Jogashima at the mouth of Tokyo Bay.

This Review discusses the basis, potential and limitations of in situ mineral carbonation as a carbon capture and storage strategy.Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has a fundamental role in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit anthropogenic warming to 1.5-2 degrees C. Most ongoing CCS projects inject CO2 into sedimentary basins and require an impermeable cap rock to prevent the CO2 from migrating to the surface. Alternatively, captured carbon can be stored through injection into reactive rocks (such as mafic or ultramafic lithologies), provoking CO2 mineralization and, thereby, permanently fixing carbon with negligible risk of return to the atmosphere. Although in situ mineralization offers a large potential volume for carbon storage in formations such as basalts and peridotites (both onshore and offshore), its large-scale implementation remains little explored beyond laboratory-based and field-based experiments. In this Review, we discuss the potential of mineral carbonation to address the global CCS challenge and contribute to long-term reductions in atmospheric CO2. Emphasis is placed on the advances in making this technology more cost-effective and in exploring the limits and global applicability of CO2 mineralization.",,,,,,,,,254,14,0,0,38,1,273,,,,2662-138X,,,,,,,,,,"Orkuveita Reykjavikur, Reykjavik, IcelandUniv Paul Sabatier, UMR 5563, CNRS, GET, Toulouse, FranceColumbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USAUniv Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, Reykjavik, IcelandUCL, Dept Earth Sci, London, England",Orkuveita Reykjavikur,,,2020-02-01,WOS:000649445800010,,

While stream restoration has received considerable attention, mitigation efforts focused on the improvement of physical habitat have not proven completely effective. Several small-scale studies have emphasized that effective restoration strategies require a more holistic understanding of the variables at play, although the generalization of the findings based on the small-scale studies remains unclear. Using a comprehensive statewide stream monitoring database from West Virginia (WV), a detailed landscape dataset, and a machine learning algorithm, this study explores the interactive impacts of water quality and physical habitat on stream ecosystem health as indicated by benthic macroinvertebrate scores. Given the long history of energy extraction in this region (i.e., coal mining and oil/gas production), investigation of energy extraction influences is highlighted. Our results demonstrate that a combination of good habitat and low specific conductance is generally associated with favorable benthic macroinvertebrate scores, whereas poor habitat combined with water quality conditions typically indicative of high ionic strength are associated with impaired stream status. In addition, streams impacted by both energy extraction and residential development had a higher percentage of impairment compared to those impacted predominantly by energy extraction or residential development alone. While water quality played a more important role in the ecosystem health of streams impacted primarily by energy extraction activities, habitat seems to be more influential in streams impacted by residential development. Together, these findings emphasize that stream restoration strategies should consider interactive effects of multiple environmental stressors tailored to specific sites or site types - as opposed to considering a single stressor or multiple stressors separately.

Three sediment cores were collected at Inland and Seaward locations at both marshes similar to 6 years after restoration. Benthic diatoms, C3 plants, C4 plants, and particulate organic matter (POM) were collected throughout the NRD. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of sources and sediments were used in a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model to determine the contribution of each carbon source to the sediments of both marshes. Autochthonous marsh C3 plants contributed 73 +/- 10% (98 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and 89 +/- 11% (119 g C m(-2) year(-1)) to Reference-Inland and Reference-Seaward sediment carbon sinks, respectively. In contrast, the sediment carbon sink at the Restoring Marsh received a broad assortment of predominantly allochthonous materials, which varied in relative contribution based on source distance and abundance.

This definition, therefore, contains the following conditions: the existence of a “place of business” ; this place of business must be “fixed”; the carrying on of the business of the enterprise through this fixed place of business.

Community properties and temporal/spatial variability were analyzed besides toxicant parameters such as hydrocarbons and trace-metals. Overall infaunal density increased, taxa proportion changed, and small-size opportunistic organisms prevailed throughout the study. Annual abundance-biomass comparison (ABC) curves revealed progressive stress scenarios from moderate to severe. Concentrations of vanadium, nickel, cobalt, PAHs and AHs increased gradually over time. However, low correlations between benthic density and biogeochemical variables were determined. Initially, sedimentary properties were the main drivers of benthic community structure; subsequently, nickel, vanadium and PAHs, indicative of anthropogenic effect, were highlighted. Interannual variability in the macroinfauna was attributed to the synergy of several environmental factors. Undoubtedly, compounds derived from fossil fuels had a significant disturbance role, but their source remains uncertain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparisons of global estimates of average, long-term effective size (N-eLT) with estimates from individual sample localities indicated genetic heterogeneity within both the Atlantic and Gulf. These results paralleled those of prior genetic studies of red snapper from the Gulf.

J,,,,,,,,,Mattias Green,,Mixing in the open ocean from the Last Glacial Maximum to present date: tidal dissipation and ocean resonance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Aug 31 2008,2008,"Summary Vertical mixing in the ocean causes a vertical transport of water, and with it nutrients, salt, heat and pollutants. It is also one of the main mechanisms behind the large scale ocean circulation, and therefore of immense importance for the climate of our planet. The driving force of the vertical mixing in the deep parts of the open ocean, far away from coasts and the wind-mixed upper kilometre of the water column, is the tide. In order to understand and be able to predict changes in climate, we must look back in time and try to understand, explain and quantify previous changes in climate. In the past 21 000 years, since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the sea level has risen by 115-135 m. A major consequence of this sea level rise has been the flooding of the continental shelf seas. Although the massive expansion of the shelf seas has been described as the most important geological event of recent time, there has been no integrated study of the impact of this event on global ocean circulation, and only a few investigations of its impact on ocean mixing. Whilst the contemporary shelf seas only account for 7% of the surface area of the global ocean, over 70% of the tidal energy dissipation takes place there. In consequence the historical rise in sea level has had a profound effect on the dissipation of tidal energy in shelf seas. This will in turn be reflected in a change in the dissipation of tidal energy in the deep ocean. As the tide provides a major, if not the major, component of the mechanical energy which ventilates the deep ocean through turbulent mixing, the rise in sea level has had a substantial impact on the marine system. Tides therefore do not only have the potential to affect the global climate, by influencing the strength of the oceanic circulation, but they can also influence key global biogeochemical cycles and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Within the project we will therefore aim to improve the accuracy of the estimates of the tidally driven open ocean mixing in the historical ocean. This will be done using two computer models of the ocean tides. We will simulate the changes in the global ocean mixing rates caused by the ocean tides from the peak of the last ice-age until today, and try to explain and quantify the changes which occur. This will open for a further understanding of the forcing of our ocean circulation system in the past and today. It will also provide insight into the sensitivity of the ocean mixing system, and how it relates to climate dynamics and climate change.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/F014821/1,,,,,,,,Bangor University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15398535,,

Can wave breaking walls in shallow coastal areas serve as habitat for aquatic organisms? Journal of Coastal Research, 29(2), 339-346. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.This study aimed to assess the impact of a small-sized wave breaking wall constructed from concrete poles settled close to the shoreline on the community structure of aquatic fauna. Macroepifauna was collected directly from pole surfaces. Fish, shrimps, macrobenthos, and zooplankton were collected in October 2009, February 2010, and June 2010 at three different sites: inside the wall, outside the wall, and a control site. It was found that this hard structure played a large role in the recruitment and settlement of macroepifauna. Balanus spp. was the most dominant taxa attached on surface of the pole (48.6%), followed by Perna viridis (44.2%) and Brachiodonthes sp. (5.2%). For other organisms, a significant difference was found only in the abundance of macrobenthos at different sites (p < 0.05) with greater abundance at the control site. There was no significant impact by the wall on abundance of fish, shrimp, and zooplankton (p > 0.05) on the species richness of all organisms (p > 0.05). It is also evident that the season has a significant impact on the abundance of fish (p < 0.005) and shrimp (p < 0.005) and the species richness of fish (p < 0.05). This seasonal impact was clearly detected by cluster dendrogram and quantified by analysis of similarity. It is therefore crucial to acknowledge further the role of this structure, not only as coastal protection, but also in recruitment, succession, assemblages, and community structure of stocks in the vicinity of this habitat.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Muang Pattani, Thailand",,,,2013-05-05,WOS:000316162400008,,

We surveyed Posidonia oceanica and Posidonia sinuosa meadows along depth-induced gradients of light availability to assess the variability in their sedimentary organic carbon (C-org) stocks and accretion rates. This study showed a fourfold decrease in C-org stocks from 2-4m to 6-8m depth P. sinuosa meadows (averaging 7.0 and 1.8kgm(-2), respectively; top meter of sediment) and a fourteenfold to sixteenfold decrease from shallow (2m) to deep (32m) P. oceanica meadows (200 and 19kgm(-2) average, respectively; top 2.7m of sediment). The average C-org accretion rates in shallow P. sinuosa meadows were higher (10.5gm(-2) yr(-1)) than in deeper meadows (2.1gm(-2) yr(-1)). The reduction of sedimentary C-org stocks and accretion rates along depth-related gradients of light reduction suggests that irradiance, controlling plant productivity, meadow density, and sediment accretion rates, is a key environmental factor affecting C-org storage potential of seagrasses. The results obtained highlighted the exceptional carbon storage capacity of P. oceanica meadows at Balearic Islands (Spain), containing the highest areal C-org stocks of all seagrasses (estimated in up to 691-770kgm(-2) in 8-13m thick deposits). Seagrass communities are experiencing worldwide decline, and reduced irradiance (following e.g., eutrophication or sediment regime alterations) will lead to photoacclimation responses (i.e., reduced plant productivity and shoot density), which may impact the carbon sequestration capacity of seagrasses.",,,,,,,,,95,2,0,0,75,0,102,,,0886-6236,1944-9224,,,,,,,,,,"Edith Cowan Univ, Ctr Marine Ecosyst Res, Sch Nat Sci, Perth, WA, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Perth, WA 6009, AustraliaUniv Kebangsaan Malaysia, Sch Environm & Nat Resource Sci, Fac Sci & Technol, Bangi 43600, MalaysiaCSIC, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Blanes, Girona, Spain",,,,2014-09-01,WOS:000343752900003,,

The present work offers a contribution to the knowledge of the bioerosive impact of sponges on archaeological artifacts such as the marble statues recovered from the shipwreck of Antikythera (Greece) and the Blue Grotto (Capri, Italy). These peculiar substrates lie on the seabed, but only little information is available about the risks during their underwater life. Bioeroding sponges caused the loss of substantial parts of the artifacts' lithic substrate (penetrating up to some centimeters depth), often in association with microborers and boring bivalves. The results highlighted that the bioeroding species in Capri were mostly Dotona pulchella mediterranea, Cliona janitrix, Cliona schmidtii, and Spiroxya levispira. Their chambers were often filled by secondary, non-eroding sponges such as Agelas oroides, Jaspis incrustans, Dercitus (Stoeba) plicatus, Erylus sp., and Pachastrella monilifera. In the Antikythera statues, C. schmidtii was the most frequent species, often easily recognized by its purple color. It was often associated with other excavating sponges such as Cliona vermifera, and Dotona pulchella mediterranea. Pachastrella monilifera and Jaspis incrustans were also present as insinuating species. Incomplete sets of spicules and bioerosion pits observed by SEM were referred to the genera Alectona and Siphonodictyon. The presence of the sciophilous epilithic species Petrobiona massiliana and Merlia normani in both sites revealed that these archeological sites have comparable environmental conditions.

Quantifying the behavior and distribution of animals around marine renewable energy devices is crucial for understanding, predicting, and potentially mitigating any threats posed by these installations. The Flow and Benthic Ecology 4D (FLOWBEC) autonomous seabed platform integrated an Imagenex multibeam echosounder and a Simrad EK60 multi-frequency echosounder to monitor marine life in a 120 degrees sector over ranges up to 50 m, seven to eight times per second. Established target detection algorithms fail within MRE sites, due to high levels of backscatter generated by the turbulent physical dynamics, limiting and biasing analysis to only periods of low current speed. This study presents novel algorithms to extract diving seabirds, fish, and fish schools from the intense backscatter caused by turbulent dynamics in flows of 4 m s-1. Filtering, detection, and tracking using a modified nearest neighbor algorithm provide robust tracking of animal behavior using the multibeam echosounder. Independent multifrequency target detection is demonstrated using the EK60 with optimally calculated thresholds, scale-sensitive filters, morphological exclusion, and frequency-response characteristics. This provides sensitive and reliable detection throughout the entire water column and at all flow speeds. Dive profiles, depth preferences, predator-prey interactions, and fish schooling behavior can be analyzed, in conjunction with the hydrodynamic impacts of marine renewable energy devices. Coregistration of targets between the acoustic instruments increases the information available, providing quantitative measures including frequency response from the EK60, and target morphology and behavioral interactions from the multibeam echosounder. The analyses draw on deployments at a tidal energy site in Scotland to compare the presence and absence of renewable energy structures across a range of physical and trophic levels over complete spring-neap tidal cycles. These results can be used to inform how animals forage in these sites and whether individuals face collision risks. This quantitative information can de-risk the licensing process and, with a greater mechanistic understanding at demonstration scales, its predictive power could reduce the monitoring required at future arrays.",,,,,,,,,35,2,0,0,14,0,39,,,0364-9059,1558-1691,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, ScotlandUniv Aberdeen, Sch Engn, Aberdeen AB24 3UE, ScotlandUniv Bath, Dept Phys, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, EnglandNatl Oceanog Ctr, Liverpool L3 5DA, Merseyside, EnglandBangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Bangor LL59 5AB, Gwynedd, Wales",,,,2017-12-06,WOS:000412626600020,,

Furthermore, understanding the geomechanical properties and stability behaviour of the coastal rock mass and rocky seabed underlying the ship was of similar importance. To assess the stability conditions of the ship, a ground-based monitoring system was installed in front of the wreck. The network included a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) device, which was used to perform remote semiautomatic geomechanical characterization of the observed rock mass. Using TLS survey techniques, three main discontinuity sets were identified in the granitic rock mass of Giglio Island. Furthermore, a multibeam bathymetric survey was used to qualitatively characterize the seabed. To integrate the processed TLS data and quantitatively describe the rock mass quality, a subsequent field survey was carried out to provide a rock mass geomechanical evaluation (from very good to moderate quality). Based on the acquired information, kinematic and stability analyses were performed to create a spatial prediction of rock failure mechanisms in the study area. The obtained kinematic hazard index values were generally low; only the plane failure index reached slightly higher values. The general stability of the rock mass was confirmed by the stability analysis, which yielded a high safety factor value (approximately 12).",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,0723-2632,1434-453X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Firenze, Dept Earth Sci, Via La Pira 4, I-50121 Florence, Italy",,,,2017-09-15,WOS:000408918600009,,

The 0.680 electromechanical tow cable from which the vehicle and payload are suspended carries the full load and provides electrical power. The vehicle provides lateral position control. We used this capability to suspend a 0.25m(2) box core below the vehicle and to take sediment samples at locations determined via transponder navigation. In spite of moderately rough weather conditions with 20 knot winds and 1.5-3 m seas on average, and in spite off operations from a ship without dynamic positioning, eight usable core samples were taken at ranges of 10 m to 1 km from the wreck. The vehicle was also used to deploy four sediment traps and an ADCP at precisely located bottom positions on a 50 m radius around the wreck.

In surface waters, Ba, Fe, Cu, Ni, Mn, and Co were relatively well correlated with salinity during all cruises, suggesting mixing with river water was the main influence on metal distributions in these waters. However, in deep oil/gas plumes (1000-1400 m depth), modestly elevated concentrations of Co and Ba were observed in late May, compared with postblowout conditions. Analysis of the oil itself along with leaching experiments confirm the oil as the source of the Co, whereas increased Ba was likely due to drilling mud used in the top kill attempt. Deep plume dissolved Mn largely reflected natural benthic input, though some samples showed slight elevation probably associated with the top kill. Dissolved Fe concentrations were low and also appeared largely topographically controlled and reflective of benthic input. Estimates suggest that microbial Fe demand may have affected the Fe distribution but probably not to the extent of Fe becoming a growth-limiting factor.

The establishment of light requirements for seagrass growth has been a major focus of research in marine ecology, and different quantitative models provide predictions for seagrass lower depth limits. In contrast, the influence of energy levels on the establishment, growth, and maintenance of seagrasses has received less attention, and to date there are no quantitative models predicting the evolution of seagrasses as a function of hydrodynamics at a large scale level. Hence, it is not possible to predict either the upper depth limit of the distribution of seagrasses or the effects that different energy regimes will have on these limits. The aim of this work is to provide a comprehensible methodology for obtaining quantitative knowledge and predictive capacity for estimating the upper depth limit of seagrasses as a response to wave energy dissipated on the seafloor. The methodology has been applied using wave data from 1958 to 2001 in order to obtain the mean wave climate in deep water seaward from an open sandy beach in the Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean Sea where the seagrass Posidonia oceanica forms an extensive meadow. Mean wave conditions were propagated to the shore using a two-dimensional parabolic model over the detailed bathymetry. The resulting hydrodynamics were correlated with bottom type and the distribution of P. oceanica. Results showed a predicted near-bottom orbital velocity of between 38 and 42 cm s(-1) as a determinant of the upper depth limit of P. oceanica. This work shows the importance of interdisciplinary effort in ecological modeling and, in particular, the need for hydrodynamical studies to elucidate the distribution of seagrasses in shallow depths. Moreover, the use of predictive models would permit evaluation of the effects of coastal activities (construction of ports, artificial reefs, beach nutrient-input, dredging) on benthic ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,108,0,0,0,76,0,111,,,0006-8055,1437-4323,,,,,,,,,,"CSIC UIB, IMEDEA, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, Esporles 07190, Spain",,,,2009-11-01,WOS:000272161300004,,

When the model reefs were put in the aquarium, considerable changes were nearly always observed to increase the percentage of fishes in the division where the models were put. Effectiveness of model reefs to attract fishes varied depending on the shape and size of the models, but the variation was irregular and conflicting. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: From auth",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1966-01-01,BCI:BCI19674800026879,,

This includes detecting and characterizing: (1) sounds produced and used by living marine resources (e.g., endangered marine mammals); (2) natural sources of noise from physical oceanographic processes; and (3) anthropogenic noise sources that contribute to the overall ocean noise environment. Noise generated by anthropogenic activities (especially commercial shipping and seismic oil & gas exploration) is increasingly being recognized as a potential threat to marine mammals which are protected in the U.S. by the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. Current scientific data suggest that increased ambient noise levels impact marine mammals by hindering communication (Hatch et al. 2012), altering communication behavior (Parks et al. 2013), altering locomotive behavior (Pirotta et al. 2013), and inducing stress (Rolland et al. 2012). Additional concerns associated with the degraded acoustic quality of diverse habitats broaden these concerns to include possible repercussions for fish and invertebrate species, many of which NOAA manages as commercially-harvested, protects as resources within sanctuaries, or studies as key elements to sustaining healthy ecosystems. For these reasons it is important for science-based regulatory agencies including NOAA to monitor long-term trends and changes in the ambient sound field. The objective of the proposed project is to establish a network of initially ten ocean noise reference stations in U.S. waters to monitor long-term changes and trends in the underwater ambient sound field (McDonald et al. 2006). Our plan is to deploy identical autonomous acoustic recording systems developed in-house at PMEL at each reference station to ensure proper calibration and consistency of the collected data sets.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-03-17,DRCI:DATA2022044023375117,,

Uncertainty in the location of oil and gas accumulations, however, makes it difficult to assess potential impacts to wildlife populations from future development. We present a modeling approach that takes this uncertainty into account by randomly sampling the locations of oil and gas accumulations across the landscape and building out simulated infrastructure. We evaluated four management alternatives outlined for the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to demonstrate how this model can quantify the relative impacts to caribou (Rangifer tarandus) calving habitat and passerine nest survival. We were able to identify clear differences in impacts for wildlife under the four alternatives and highlighted the range of variability in how development might proceed under each scenario.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,15,0,19,,,1755-263X,,,,,,,,,,,"Wilderness Soc, Anchorage, AK 99501 USAPacific West Off, Wildlife Conservat Soc, Portland, OR 97205 USA",Wilderness Soc,,,2013-11-08,WOS:000325501800007,,

The benefits to fisheries have commonly been cited as primary motives in favour of the establishment of MPAs. To date, a good deal has been theorised with regard to the benefit of MPAs to fisheries in their adjacent areas, but there has been Little empirical evidence to support or refute hypothetical claims. Considerations for fisheries' benefits are different to those of ecological benefits in several respects. Economically, fishers' Livelihoods often depend on the marine reserve being successful. It is not enough to establish that populations of fish are growing due to protection; stocks, as well as individual fish have to be sufficiently large to be catchable by the industry. Furthermore, restrictions in fishable area ought to be compensated for by increases in catches over time. In terms of the biology of the fish themselves, evidence has shown that heavily exploited commercial fish stocks can take much longer to recover from over-exploitation than previously expected. Although there have been several studies that consider the effects of export and spill-over, there have been few that focus on the patterns that these phenomena might have on the surrounding fisheries; many assume that ecological patterns will. manifest in the fishery with time. Recently, assessment methods and predictive models have been suggested for fisheries (e.g. Rapfish, Ecopath/Ecosim), some of which have been adapted specifically for MpAs. In this paper we review recent progress in the field of MPA research with particular focus on fisheries assessment. We also identify priorities, and knowledge gaps, for determining and accurately predicting the benefits of MpAs to fishers.

Mortality rates for Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus (n = 87) were estimated by telemetry from December 2005 to June 2009 in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. At five separate sites an array of five receivers was deployed with one receiver at the center (reef) and four receivers placed 1,100m (or 420m) north, south, east, and west of center. These arrays enabled the direct estimation of fishing mortality, natural mortality, and emigration of acoustically tagged Red Snapper. Out of the 70 fish that remained after the 6-d recovery period, 19 were caught, 10 died naturally, and 27 emigrated from the 2-km-radius study sites. The Kaplan-Meier staggered-entry method was used to estimate survival from different mortality events, and survival was converted to instantaneous mortality rates. For all years combined, total mortality (95% confidence interval) was 0.39 (0.19-0.64), fishing mortality (F) was 0.27 (0.11-0.54), and natural mortality (M) was 0.11 (0.06-0.20). Each year estimated annual M increased, M = 0 in 2006, M = 0.19 (0.07-0.48) in 2007, and M = 0.21 (0.09-0.44) in 2008, while annual F rates decreased, F = 0.61 (0.16-1.67) in 2006, F = 0.22 (0.09-0.51) in 2007, and F = 0.14 (0.05-0.35) in 2008. Thus, in more recent years (2007-2008) M estimates were higher, while F estimates were lower than past estimates used in stock assessments (M = 0.1; F = 0.35). These decreasing rates of F over 2006-2008 suggests that in recent years restrictive management efforts have succeeded in reducing fishing mortality, and although M has increased it may have leveled off near M = 0.2 such that populations will continue to increase.

CO2 bubbles released at regulated rates between 500 and 5000 mL min(-1) were searched for with SSS to elucidate the detection limit, which depends on the towing speed and the altitude of SSS, and the horizontal distance between the release point and SSS. When the towing speed was less than 6 knots, SSS was able to detect CO2 bubbles released at 1000 mL min(-1) (approximately 4 tonnes year(-1)), which is an extremely small rate compared with injection rates in commercial scale storage, O(10(6)) tonnes year(-1). The time required for searching an area of 1 km(2) with SSS was estimated to be between 1.7 and 3.4 hours, assuming that SSS was towed at an altitude of 27 m. Thus, SSS was demonstrated to be serviceable for marine monitoring. pH measured at 5 m away from the release point dropped by larger than 0.05 four times during the experiment. Only one of them might have been due to the CO2 release, and the others were due to intrusion of water from deeper layers because temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen simultaneously changed. This indicates that bubble searching with SSS could detect smaller-scale CO2 leakages than locating anomalous carbonate values, although the latter is still important in case all or most of CO2 dissolve before the emission to the sea.

Invitations were sent to over 150 scientists and stakeholders, including local and regional governments, tribes, native associations, oil industry, and environmental groups on the Alaska OCS Region mailing list. In addition to those to the Alaska OCS Region mailing list, invitations went to approximately 50-name-requested scientists. Over a hundred scientists and stakeholders attended with 77 registering. The registered participants are listed in Appendix B. The purpose of the meeting was to briefly review existing research; to identify information needs; and to recommend research monitoring concepts, experimental designs, and scope of field studies to address MMS needs for environmental monitoring of potential Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas exploration and development. Specifically, the workshop will provide input to a COMIDA Phase II environmental monitoring field program proposed for FY 2008. The first day of the workshop focused on talks on MMS and other oil/gas plans and activities in the Chukchi Sea and invited presentations on environmental background, knowledge, and monitoring issues. Summaries of these talks including questions and answers are provided in the Introduction and Setting the Stage of this report. Copies of the presentations are in Appendix C. On the second day the workshop split into four working groups: Physical Oceanography & Fate and Effects; Biology, including benthos, fish, and waterfowl; Protected Species; and Socioeconomics and Subsistence. These working groups developed Task Profiles specific to Monitoring Effects of Chukchi OCS Oil and Gas Exploration and Development. Working group participants are listed in Appendix B. On the third day, the four working groups presented to the entire workshop and led discussion of their resulting Task Profiles. Thirteen monitoring study profiles were developed by four working groups, were presented to and discussed by the workshop on the third day and submitted to MMS for consideration. The workshop profiles with transcribed discussions are in Study Profiles. Several participants continued to work on task specific profiles after the workshop ended and provided these improved profiles to MMS. These post-workshop profiles have not been incorporated into the workshop proceedings but have been accepted as part of the peer review of workshop results. The workshop profiles, post-workshop profiles and other review comments are being used to revise and prioritize COMIDA study profiles for entry into the Alaska Annual Studies Plan process. The Alaska Annual Studies Plan will also be widely available for review.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3000 Red Hill Avenue, Costa Mesa, California 92626, USA",,,,2007-04-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14308053383,,

This site is close to shore and to major metropolitan areas that can benefit from this cleanly generated power. Large tidal exchanges take place at this site and can provide predictable and sustainable tidal energy. As part of the permitting process Snohomish has undertaken a seafloor investigation to determine the habitat characteristics of the seafloor and inform the appropriate location for the turbines' placement. In 2010, to assess habitat types multibeam echosounder (MBES) images were produced and ground-truth video surveys using an ROV were undertaken with the requirement that little disturbance occurs to the seafloor. Collection of these data was challenging as the highly dynamic oceanographic and geologic (tectonic) environment made it difficult to undertake in situ observations of the seafloor. Strong tidal currents, even during predicted slack tides, forced new thinking on how data should be collected in order to evaluate the seafloor substrate, habitats and ecology in light that a statistically methodology could not be accomplished, or if indeed a statistical analysis was necessary at all. Additional information on tidal currents has been gathered since these surveys, which should aid in the future collection of data, although the underlying questions about the possibility of, and need for, a statistical analysis remain. Extensive video assessment was needed to produce a map that could exhibit habitat types. This was attempted by focusing on the geology of the seafloor and selecting common organisms, such as sessile and encrusting fauna (e.g., sea anemones, barnacle fields, crinoids) and epifauna (e.g., sea stars) to relate to substrate types. Heavily encrusted and lightly encrusted substrates were mapped to show areas where sediment is presently being transported through the area. ROV line- or timed-transects to count biota appears not to be necessary to obtain information needed to validate marine benthic habitat types. Rather, general observational transects and more stabilized in situ observational stations used for close examination of the biota and measurement of the substrate is recommended.

Here, we combined field-based microbial activity parameters, integrated multiyear particle export flux data, sinking particle fluxes measured by sediment traps, and optical data from Biogeochemical-Argo floats to quantify the main sources of organic carbon to the dark ocean.

The present study assessed effects of water-based drill cuttings, barite, bentonite, and natural sediments on shallow- and deep-water calcareous algae in short-term (30d) and long-term (90d) experiments, using 2 species from Peregrino's oil field at Campos Basin, Brazil: Mesophyllum engelhartii and Lithothamnion sp. The results were compared with the shallow-water species Lithothamnion crispatum. Smothering and burial exposures were simulated. Oxygen production and fluorescence readings were recorded. Although less productive, M. engelhartii was as sensitive to stress as Lithothamnion sp. Mesophyllum engelhartii was sensitive to smothering by drill cuttings, barite, and bentonite after 60d of exposure and was similarly affected by natural sediments after 90d. These results indicate that smothering by sediments caused physical effects that might be attributable to partial light attenuation and partial restriction on gas exchange but did not kill the calcareous algae in the long term. However, 1-mo burial by either natural sediments or drill cuttings was sufficient after 60d for both species to reduce oxygen production, and the algae were completely dead under both sources of sediments.

A peak of 92 newly settled O. chrysurus was observed around the new moon in September 1999, followed by a decline of more than 75 % over 3 wk. Light trapping near adjacent fringing reefs documented a concurrent pulse of late pelagic stage O. chrysurus. Observations in April-May and June-July 2000 recorded much smaller supply events and lower settlement densities. The effects of post-settlement movement, as opposed to early mortality, were assessed and concluded to be negligible. Firstly, fish < 8 cm total length were consistently observed in the seagrass but were never recorded in censuses of adjacent rocky habitat, where older juveniles occurred. Thus, settlement-stage fish were assumed to reside in seagrass for several weeks. Second, average home ranges for fish of 2 to 2.5 cm and 3 to 3.5 cm total length were estimated to be 2.3 m(2) and 6.3 m(2), respectively, indicating that movement of newly settled O. chrysurus was negligible compared to the size of the census area (1250 m(2)). Third, late pelagic-stage O. chrysurus caught with light traps in adjacent waters were tagged with fluorescent elastomer and released at the center of the seagrass grid the evening after their capture. Ninety-six individuals were released over 3 evenings in September 1999. Concurrent aquarium studies showed tagging mortality was 13 %. Over the following 8 d, 32 re-sightings were made. Only 1 fish was seen more than 2 to 3 m distant from where it was sighted on the first census after releases were completed, providing convincing evidence of site fidelity after settlement. Using a simple model, we conservatively estimated the coefficient of daily mortality, M, at settlement to be about 0.28 (equivalent to 76 % survival d(-1)) and to reduce by 0.042 thereafter.",,,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,34,1,39,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"ICLARM Caribbean, Eastern Pacific Off, Tortola, VI USA",ICLARM Caribbean,,,2002-07-18,WOS:000177535300023,,

However, information to forecast population-level consequences of such changes is often lacking. We developed an interim framework to assess the population consequences of disturbance when empirical information is sparse. We show how daily effects of disturbance, which are often straightforward to estimate, can be scaled to the disturbance duration and to multiple sources of disturbance. We used expert elicitation to estimate parameters that define how changes in individual behaviour or physiology affect vital rates and incorporated them into a stochastic population model. Model outputs can be used to evaluate cumulative impacts of disturbance over space and time. As an example, we forecast the potential effects of disturbance from offshore wind farm construction on the North Sea harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) population.Synthesis and applications. The interim framework can be used to forecast the effects of disturbances from human activities on animal populations, to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures and to identify priority areas for research that reduces uncertainty in population forecasts.

In this study, we found that sea-level rise triggered salt marsh habitat restructuring, with the associated vegetation changes enhancing salt marsh elevation resilience. A continuous record of marsh elevation relative to sea level that includes reconstruction of high-resolution, sub-decadal, marsh elevation over the past century, coupled with a lower-resolution 1500-year record, revealed that relative sea-level rose 1.5 +/- 0.4 m, following local glacial isostatic adjustment (1.2 mm/yr). As sea-level rise has rapidly accelerated, the high marsh zone dropped 11 cm within the tidal frame since 1932, leading to greater inundation and a shift to flood- and salt-tolerant low marsh species. Once the marsh platform fell to the elevation favored by low-marsh Spartina alterniflara, the elevation stabilized relative to sea level. Currently low marsh accretion keeps pace with sea-level rise, while present day high marsh zones that have not transitioned to low marsh have a vertical accretion deficit. Greater biomass productivity, and an expanding subsurface accommodation space favorable for salt marsh organic matter preservation, provide a positive feed-back between sea-level rise and marsh platform elevation. Carbon storage was 46 +/- 28 g C/m(2)/yr from 550 to 1800 CE, increasing to 129 +/- 50 g C/m(2)/yr in the last decade. Enhanced carbon storage is controlled by vertical accretion rates, rather than soil carbon density, and is a direct response to anthropogenic eustatic sea-level rise, ultimately providing a negative feedback on climate warming.",,,,,,,,,55,0,0,0,28,0,62,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Woods Hole Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, 384 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USAUniv Alaska, Dept Geosci, POB 755780, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USAUniv N Carolina, Earth & Ocean Sci Dept, 601 South Coll Rd, Wilmington, NC 28403 USAWaquoit Bay Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, 131 Waquoit Highway, Waquoit, MA 02536 USAWoods Hole Oceanog Inst, Coastal Syst Grp, 266 Woods Hole Rd,Mail Stop 22, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USAUniv Coll Dublin, Sch Math & Stat, Dublin 4, IrelandTexas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, 400 Bizzell St, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Waquoit Bay Natl Estuarine Res Reserve,,,2019-02-15,WOS:000457506600006,,

In this paper the UK is used as a case study area to develop methodologies to quantify and value the ecosystem service of blue carbon sequestration and storage in coastal margin habitats. Changes in UK coastal habitat area between 1900 and 2060 are documented, the long term stocks of carbon stored by these habitats are calculated, and the capacity of these habitats to sequester CO2 is detailed. Changes in value of the carbon sequestration service of coastal habitats are then projected for 2000-2060 under two scenarios, the maintenance of the current state of the habitat and the continuation of current trends of habitat loss. If coastal habitats are maintained at their current extent, their sequestration capacity over the period 2000-2060 is valued to be in the region of 1 pound billion UK sterling (3.5% discount rate). However, if current trends of habitat loss continue, the capacity of the coastal habitats both to sequester and store CO2 will be significantly reduced, with a reduction in value of around 0.25 pound billion UK sterling (2000-2060; 3.5% discount rate). If loss-trends due to sea level rise or land reclamation worsen, this loss in value will be greater. This case study provides valuable site specific information, but also highlights global issues regarding the quantification and valuation of carbon sequestration and storage. Whilst our ability to value ecosystem services is improving, considerable uncertainty remains. If such ecosystem valuations are to be incorporated with confidence into national and global policy and legislative frameworks, it is necessary to address this uncertainty. Recommendations to achieve this are outlined. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The reefs were deployed at 40, 50, 70, and 90 m from a flare stack located in a gas field off the coast of Mississippi. Juvenile red snapper were observed at one of the open-bottom sites when it was first surveyed, but none during a second survey conducted 45 days later. Age-0 and age-1 fish showed a preference for the more complex study reefs, but presence of age-1 appeared to limit recruitment of age-0 to a reef. As age-1 fish started to leave the reefs, increased numbers of age-0 were observed moving onto them. However, age-0 were never observed at the 40-m reef occupied by older fish throughout the study. Distance from the flare stack also appeared to have an effect on recruitment to the reefs. Age-0 were first observed at the 50-m reefs. They appeared at the 70-m reefs a week later and at the 90-m reefs almost a month later. Age-1 fish showed a preference for the reefs located closest to the flare stack. Juvenile red snapper site fidelity was determined using fish that either were tagged and released on site or were removed from the capture site before release. Fish from the on-site release were repeatedly sighted at the capture reef over about a 2-month period. Displaced fish, as determined with tracking equipment, were able to find their way back to the capture reef from as far away as 0.43 km in about 25 min. We conclude that juvenile red snapper are not only faithful to structures, but also have homing capabilities.

Whether there is a statistical significant correspondence between the environmental measurements and the biological changes is tested after quantifying the biological changes by using the community disturbance index (CDI). Finally, the environmental variables that are most strongly associated with the biological changes are identified, and it is proposed that these are strong candidates as the pollutants responsible for the biological changes observed.

Almost nothing is known about annual survival rates and breeding site fidelity of the Common Scoter Melanitta nigra, a species whose life history traits are poorly known. Adult female annual survival is an especially important population parameter in this species, which has a male-biased sex ratio (1.2-2.0 males: 1 female on the breeding grounds, Bengtson 1972, A. Garoarsson in litt.). From a conservation management perspective, it is essential that we understand the basic population dynamics of this species, because of its susceptibility to, for instance, oil pollution incidents as a result of its aggregated non-breeding distribution (e. g. Joensen & Hansen 1977, Hughes et al. 1997). Although not generally threatened on the breeding grounds (due to its dispersed nature and remote nesting habitats), increasing development of shallow marine coastal zones (e. g. as a result of increased exploitation of mineral and biological resources, increasing shipping traffic and offshore windfarm developments) threatens moulting and wintering areas of the species. Adequate environmental impact assessment associated with such development necessitates at least a rudimentary assessment of the sensitivity of the Common Scoter to increased mortality and habitat loss, based upon demographic modelling.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,5,0,7,,,0019-1019,1474-919X,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Environm Res Inst, Dept Coastal Zone Ecol, DK-8410 Ronde, DenmarkIceland Inst Nat Hist, IS-125 Reykjavik, IcelandMuseum Natl Hist Nat, Ctr Rech Biol Populat Oiseaux, F-75005 Paris, France",Iceland Inst Nat Hist,,,2003-04-01,WOS:000181831100006,,

China is the world's largest producer of seafood and has used a variety of production methods in the ocean including domestic capture fisheries, aquaculture (both freshwater and marine), stock enhancement, artificial reef building, and distant water fisheries. Here we survey the outcomes of China's marine seafood production strategies, with particular attention paid to the associated costs, benefits, and risks. Benefits identified include high production, low management costs, and high employment, but significant costs and risks were also identified. For example, a majority of fish in China's catches are one year-old, ecosystem and catch composition has changed relative to the past, wild and farmed stocks can interact both negatively and positively, distant water fisheries are a potential source of conflict, and disease has caused crashes in mariculture farms. Reforming China's wild capture fisheries management toward strategies used by developed nations would continue to shift the burden of production to aquaculture and could have negative social impacts due to differences in fishing fleet size and behavior, ecosystem structure, and markets. Consequently, China may need to develop novel management methods in reform efforts, rather than rely on examples from other large seafood producing countries.

Delta restoration involves environmental engineering via river diversions, which utilize self-organizing processes to create prograding deltas. Here we analyse sediment cores from Wax Lake delta, a product of environmental engineering, to quantify the burial of organic carbon. We find that, despite relatively low concentrations of organic carbon measured in the cores (about 0.4%), the accumulation of about 3 T m(-2) of sediment over the approximate 60 years of delta building resulted in the burial of a significant amount of organic carbon (16 kg m(-2)). This equates to an apparent organic carbon accumulation rate of 250 +/- 23 g m(-2) yr(-1), which implicitly includes losses by carbon emissions and erosion. Our estimated accumulation rate for Wax Lake delta is substantially greater than previous estimates based on the top metre of delta sediments and comparable to those of coastal mangrove and marsh habitats.

The DSD will meet the current requirements of the regulatory regime, but provide flexibility to evolve in response to changing regulations. Stakeholders as partners is considered essential to a successful project and significantly increases the likelihood that outputs will be applied to real-world decision-making.Objectives:(1) To develop a user-friendly DSD to facilitate decision-making for understanding the impacts (positive and negative) of decommissioning operations on the condition of MPA qualifying features and site integrity;(2) To gather and assess (providing confidence scores) the best available scientific evidence to underpin the assessment of impacts of decommissioning options on major marine habitats and species, including taking an innovative natural capital focus;(3) To engage end-users (incl. industry, industry bodies, SNCBs, regulators & academia) throughout the project to provide proof of concept, identify sources of evidence and provide case studies;(4) To assess potential short and long-term impacts of decommissioning options on MPA qualifying features and site integrity using industry-led case study examples from the North Norfolk Sandbanks and Saturn Reefs cSAC/SCI, and(5) To provide end-users with an innovative and user-friendly evidence-based approach to better understand the risks, opportunities and impacts of decommissioning on MPAs and the wider marine environment.Impacts:Although it is unlikely that the full impacts of DECOM-MPA will be measurable within the project timescale, expected impacts will provide the best combination of:Environmental benefits:- maintained or enhanced MPA integrity;- reduced impact on marine ecosystems;- maximisation of ecosystem service provision;- improved scientific evidence base to support sustainable decommissioning (as well as renewable energy and other construction activities within MPAs).Economic benefits:- support a transparent decision process, decreasing the likelihood of challenging the method selection and reducing associated additional time and cost of regulatory reviews of decommissioning programmes;- early insights into risks and opportunities presented by decommissioning operations;- strengthened links with academia to influence the future research agenda to deliver industry-relevant knowledge, and- enhancing transferability potential of decision support products to other areas.Societal benefits:- enhanced sustainability and societal acceptability of selected decommissioning options;- translating existing knowledge to make it useable and accessible to users;- improved knowledge gained through research (cognitive benefits);- identifying unrealised benefits from decommissioning options within and out with MPAs;- identified knowledge gaps improving efficiency of public research spending, and- enhanced reputation by exporting UK scientific excellence to inform global decommissioning solutions.Keywords: Decision Support Document, stakeholders, Marine Protected Areas, decommissioning, oil & gas, evidence, assessment, case studiesKey Stakeholders: BEIS, JNCC, NE, SNH, Oil and Gas Industry, Oil and Gas Industry Representatives, Marine Scotland, MMO",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/P016553/1,,,,,,,,University of Hull,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15368488,,

The objectives of the study reported here included determination of ES concentrations in sediment collected in the area of the Gulf of Gdansk (Baltic Sea) and search for the possible correlations with the ecotoxicity results. Sediment samples were collected from four locations: the Vistula River mouth, in the Port Basin, in the area of discharge of the treated wastewater from the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and in the area of the sunken World War II s/s 'Stuttgart' shipwreck. The levels of elemental sulfur were determined using a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Toxicity of marine sediment samples was estimated for three biotest organisms - bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri, crustacean Heterocypris incongruens, and Synapis alba plant. The highest toxicity of sediments for all indicator organisms was observed in samples taken at the place of the shipwreck (2-100%). The same samples had a high sulfur content (16.7-143.2 mu g/g dry weight (d.w.)) therefore, it was decided to investigate whether the presence of ES in the sediment in the studied area can have an impact on the results of the ecotoxicity determination in real samples. However, the removal of sulfur from the samples resulted in no significant changes in the level of toxicity of the samples. In this research it could not be confirmed that the presence of elemental sulfur is the only factor responsible for the observed sediment toxicity. It seems that other compounds or their mixtures present in the sediment may have a significant influence on the results obtained.

A concern raised against widespread windfarm development is that it may negatively impact bird populations as a result of bird collision with turbines, habitat loss and disturbance. Using systematic review methodology bird abundance data were synthesized from 19 globally-distriuted windfarms using meta-analysis. The effects of bird taxon, turbine number, power, location, latitude, habitat type, size of area, time since operation, migratory status of the species and quality of evidence were analysed using meta-regression. Although the synthesized data suggest a significant negative impact of windfarms on bird abundance, there is considerable variation in the impact of individual windfarm sites on individual bird species, and it is unclear if the negative impact is a decline in population abundance or a decline in use owing to avoidance. Anscriformes experienced greater declines in abundance than other taxa, followed by Charadriiformes, Falconiformes and Accipitriformes, and Passeriformes. Time since windfarms commenced operation also had a significant impact on bird abundance, with longer operating times resulting in greater declines in abundance than short operating times. Other variables, including turbine number and turbine power either had very weak but statistically significant effects or did not have a significant effect on bird abundance. Windfarms may have significant biological impacts, especially over longer time scales, but the evidence-base is poor, with many studies being methodologically weak, and more long-term impact assessments are require. There is clear evidence that Anseriformes (wildfowl) and Charadriiformes (waders) experience declines in abundance, suggesting that a precautionary approach should be adopted to windfarm development near aggregations of these taxa in offshore and coastal locations. The impact of windfarm developments on bird populations must also be viewed in the context of the possible impact of climate change in the absence of windfarms.",,,,,,,,,124,3,0,0,101,0,145,,,0376-8929,1469-4387,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Birmingham, Ctr Evidence Based Conservat, Sch Biosci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",,,,2007-03-01,WOS:000246796700001,,

In the present study we challenge this lack of information by the development of marine species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) for three nontoxic stressors: suspended clays, burial by sediment. and change in sediment grain size. Through a literature study, effect levels were obtained for suspended clays, as well as for burial of biota. Information on the species preference range for median grain size was used to assess the sensitivity of marine species to changes in grain size. The 50% hazardous concentrations (HC50) for suspended barite and bentonite based on 50% effect concentrations (EC50s) were 3,010 and 1,830 mg/L, respectively. For burial the 50% hazardous level (HL50) was 5.4 cm. For change in median grain size, two SSDs were constructed; one for reducing and one for increasing the median grain size. The HL50 for reducing the median grain size was 17.8 mu m. For increasing the median grain size this value was 305 mu m. The SSDs have been constructed by using information related to offshore oil- and gas-related activities. Nevertheless, the results of the present study may have broader implications.

Combining 21 new C14-AMS and 146 existing recalibrated radiocarbon and U/Th ages, we investigated the detailed spatial and temporal variations in sedimentary facies and coralgal assemblages in fifteen cores across four reefs (Wreck, Fairfax, One Tree and Fitzroy) from the Southern GBR. Our newly defined facies and assemblages record distinct chronostratigraphic patterns in the cores, displaying both lateral zonation across the different reefs and shallowing upwards sequences, characterised by a transition from deep (Porites/faviids) to shallow (Acropora/Isopora) coral types. The revised reef accretion curves show a significant lag period, ranging from 0.7-2 ka, between flooding of the antecedent Pleistocene substrate and Holocene reef turn-on. This lag period and dominance of more environmentally tolerant early colonizers (e.g., domal Porites and faviids), suggests initial conditions that were unfavourable for coral growth. We contend that higher input of fine siliciclastic material from regional terrigenous sources, exposure to hydrodynamic forces and colonisation in deeper waters are the main factors influencing initially reduced growth and development. All four reefs record a time lag and we argue that the size and shape of the antecedent platform is most important in determining the duration between flooding and recolonisation of the Holocene reef. Finally, our study of Capricorn Bunker Group Holocene reefs suggests that the size and shape of the antecedent substrate has a greater impact on reef evolution and final evolutionary state (mature vs. senile), than substrate depth alone.

To mitigate it, we must act to reduce or prevent the emissions linked to human activities. Reaching net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is going to require fundamental contributions from Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), with up to 75-175 MtCO? expected to be stored annually by 2050 (Global CCS Institute, 2019). The wide scale development and deployment of CCS in the UK has stalled for a while and this is due to the high costs associated and fear of sequestered CO2 leaking out of the reservoir and into the environment. TenzorGEO aims to address this challenge/barrier by innovating a method to continuously monitor the reservoir using geophysical methods that will detect and track the spatial movement of injected CO2, to ensure the CO2 stays in the ground within defined boundaries and warn of any potential CO2 leakage. The technology can be deployed in a cost-effective way without the need for a specialist offshore deployment vessel and can be deployed efficiently to the seabed to offer continuous microseismic monitoring of the target reservoir and injected CO2 over the period of injection and until the injected CO2 is safely secured within the confines of the storage boundaries in the reservoir. TenzorGEO is a leader in passive microseismic technology (PMT) and aims to leverage this imaging technique to optimise long term CO2 site monitoring. Backed by successful case studies of reservoir characterisation and fluid injection monitoring, TenzorGEO are now pushing the envelope to extend the application of PMT to offshore CCS in its mission to achieve NetZero target in the UK and help reduce global CO2 emissions in the battle against climate change. This innovation will enable energy companies, oil and gas operators, and regulatory organisations to safely monitor the storage of CO2 underground in a cost effective way and prevent leakage due to early warning, thus allowing CCS to become a prevalent, reliable and scalable option to prevent the release of CO2 in to the atmosphere and help mitigate against the adverse effect of global warming and climate change. The cost-effectiveness of this solution will also support businesses (CCS operators) to recover from the pandemic with CCS underpinning the UK government and oil and gas authority energy transition plan.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,78699,,,,,,,,Tenzor Geo Ltd,Tenzor Geo Ltd,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15337319,,

Assessing the economic damage arising from such a spill is complicated, and a range of different approaches have been historically applied.

However, there is an ongoing debate regarding how the increased electricity consumption will influence the CO2 emissions in the power market, both in the short-run and in the long-run. This paper aims to address the issue and investigate the feasibility of the electrification of a large offshore area in the North Sea in comparison to standard concepts to supply energy offshore. A novel integrated model was developed for the purpose that includes and combines a process model of the offshore power generation units and a model of the European power system. The integration of the two models allows to simultaneously simulate the behavior of the offshore energy conversion systems and the effect of electrification on the onshore power system. The outcomes of the analysis show that the environmental performance of electrification is strongly affected by the selected approach to quantify the CO2 emissions associated with power from shore. Taking standard methods to supply offshore energy as basis for comparison, the marginal effect of electrification would result in increased CO2 emissions (+40%), while the average effect would entail large reductions in CO2 emissions (-48% to -90%), the extent of which depends on the geographical scope selected. An analysis on the economics of electrification indicates that its economic viability would be challenging and would not be favoured by a strong European commitment towards environmental policies since the expected increase of power price will outbalance the gains for the reduced emission costs.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,0,16,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Elect Power Engn, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2019-07-09,WOS:000472635900081,,

However, reconciling these biodiversity targets with socio-economic demands remains a great dilemma for implementing conservation policies. In this paper, Aichi Targets 11 and 12 were simultaneously addressed using Brazil's exclusive economic zone as an example. Priority areas for expanding the current system of marine protected areas within the country's eight marine ecoregions were identified with data on threatened vertebrates under different scenarios. Additionally, the potential effects of major socio-economic activities (small- and large-scale fishing, seabed mining, and oil and gas exploration) on the representation of conservation features in proposed marine protected areas were explored. Areas selected for expanding marine protected areas solely based on biodiversity data were different (spatial overlap from 62% to 93%) from areas prioritized when socio-economic features were incorporated into the analysis. The addition of socio-economic data in the prioritization process substantially decreased opportunity costs and potential conservation conflicts, at the cost of reducing significantly (up to 31%) the coverage of conservation features. Large- and small-scale fisheries act in most of the exclusive economic zone and are the major constraints for protecting high-priority areas. Nevertheless, there is some spatial mismatch between areas of special relevance for conservation and socio-economic activities, suggesting an opportunity for reconciling the achievement of biodiversity targets and development goals within the intricate Brazilian seascape by 2020 and beyond.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,14,0,18,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Oceanog & Ecol, Vitoria, ES, BrazilMinist Environm, Chico Mendes Inst Biodivers Conservat, Brasilia, DF, BrazilUniv Fed Goias, Dept Ecol, Goiania, Go, BrazilFundacao Brasileira Desenvolvimento Sustentavel, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Minist EnvironmFundacao Brasileira Desenvolvimento Sustentavel,,,2020-01-29,WOS:000509919200001,,

OOS are designed to monitor environmental, oceanographic, and atmospheric parameters and can be installed on a variety of offshore platforms. In the summer of 2009, a multi-disciplinary real-time OOS, Galveston Instrument Garden for Environmental Monitoring (GIGEM), was deployed off the coast of Galveston, Texas (Location: 29 degrees 08'29.654 '' N, 094 degrees 44'51.339 '' W) to monitor coastal waters and provide data to investigate the processes controlling coastal Texas hypoxia. Hypoxia occurs in the Gulf of Mexico and refers to low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the bottom waters caused by a combination of environmental and physical parameters. Hypoxic events commonly occur along the Louisiana and Texas coasts however, little research has been conducted to investigate the processes responsible for Texas hypoxia formation. GIGEM was designed to help solve this problem by contributing real-time measurements to compare with historical coastal data series. Unlike traditional coastal OOS, GIGEM is installed on an experimental wind farm platform, operated by Wind Energy System Technologies Inc. (WEST). GIGEM is comprised of two components, the underwater mooring and bottom package, with all instrumentation connected by a unique, intricate design of seawater and surface inductive modems. GIGEM is also the only coastal OOS collecting real-time environmental water quality measurements on the Texas shelf. The work presented describes the obstacles and challenges with deploying GIGEM, the flow of information from the water column to the user, and future plans for constructing a comprehensive picture of Texas coastal hypoxia.

The produced water is separated from the oil and gas and either reinjected into a deep formation or discharged to the ocean. The Norwegian oil and gas industry advocates ecological risk assessment as the basis for managing produced water discharges to the North Sea. In this paper, we compare estimates of ecological risks to water-column communities based on data on hydrocarbon residues in soft tissues of blue mussels deployed for a month near offshore platforms and based on predictions of the Dose related Risk and Effect Assessment Model (DREAM). The study was performed near produced water discharges to the Tampen and Ekofisk Regions of the Norwegian Sector of the North Sea. Because polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are considered the most important contributors to the ecological hazard posed by produced water discharges, comparisons made here focus on this group of compounds. The mussel approach is based on predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of individual PAH, estimated from PAH residues in mussels following deployment for a month near several produced water discharges, and predicted no effects concentrations (PNECs) based on a K-ow regression model. In the DREAM method, PECs for three PAH fractions are estimated in the three-dimensional area around produced water discharge with the DREAM model. PNECs for each fraction are based on the chronic toxicity of a representative PAH from each fraction divided by an assessment factor to account for uncertainty in the chronic value. The mussel method gives much lower estimates of ecological risk than the DREAM method. The differences are caused by the much lower PNECs used in DREAM than derived from the regression model, and by the lower concentrations of aqueous PAH predicted by DREAM than estimated from PAH residues in mussel tissues. However, the two methods rank stations at different distances from produced water discharges in the same order and both identify 2- and 3-ring PAHs as the main contributors to the ecological risk of produced water discharges. Neither method identifies a significant ecological risk of PAH in the upper water column of the oil fields. The DREAM model may produce an overly conservative estimate of ecological risk of produced water discharges to the North Sea. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we experimentally show that despite 79% lower net ecosystem production (NEP) following grazing (24.7 vs. 119.5 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) in a Caribbean Thalassia testudinum seagrass meadow, grazed areas maintained net positive metabolic carbon uptake. Additionally, grazing did not change the meadow production to respiration ratio, indicating it did not stimulate remineralization of sediment carbon stores. Compared to other published estimates of seagrass NEP (median: 20.6 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)), NEP in grazed Caribbean T. testudinum meadows is similar to that in many other ungrazed systems.

These chemicals are of low to moderate toxicity to aquatic life, are not persistent and have a low potential for bio-accumulation. Both of the solvents are miscible in water, whilst styrene is practically insoluble and, following release, it will rise to the sea surface and rapidly evaporate. More than 1000 tonnes of styrene are believed to have been lost to sea during the incident, resulting in an aerial plume of vapour which crossed Alderney and episodic contamination of air and water in the immediate vicinity of the wreck site. Analysis of edible tissues using coupled gas chromatography/mass spectrometry demonstrated low-level styrene contamination of crabs recovered from pots laid very close to the wreck site prior to the incident. These concentrations posed no risks to human consumers, and no fishery controls were implemented.

These wreck sites are good case studies for our research because they are located in different parts of the Black Sea, in anoxic and suboxic waters, respectively. Preliminary data reported here are from seawater samples taken from around the wrecks and a year-long collection of temperature, salinity, and pressure data. Trace-element data from the seawater samples are consistent with reported processes and values for the Black Sea. The oceanographic sensor data confirm the stagnant nature of the anoxic water layer that has allowed for the high level of preservation of the Sinop D wreck site. We also discuss the design and placement of two sets of experiments left in situ to characterize the decay rates of common materials found on ancient shipwrecks, including wood and metal. By providing ways to understand the chemical and physical processes that characterize different parts of the Black Sea water column, these wrecks are important sites for (1) determining the preservation potentials of cultural materials in deep water, and (2) informing the design of methodologies necessary to conserve them.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,2,0,12,,,0072-1077,,978-0-8137-2473-7,,,,,,,,,"Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USAUniv Massachusetts, Fiske Ctr Archaeol Res, Boston, MA 02125 USA",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000296227700012,,

Here we examined the influence of microhabitats on the distribution and survival of the exploited limpet Patella candei on natural shores before determining the effect of introducing such habitats to an artificial seawall. On natural shores individuals were associated with pits (a natural feature of volcanic rocky shores). Animals inhabiting pits showed reduced mortality and were smaller than those on open rock. Microhabitat utilisation was similar over the vertical range of distribution of A candei. Following observation of natural patterns, we applied this knowledge by experimentally drilling pits at varying densities and sizes in a seawall that had been constructed with simple topographical complexity. Overall, the number of animals increased in areas with experimentally increased microhabitat area. There was evidence that this was the result of immigration (larger animals) but also of increased recruitment. This study demonstrates one cost-effective way of conciliating the need to protect our coastlines while promoting the conservation and stock enhancement of over-exploited species.

Small quantities of oil (i.e., 10 ml) results in often lethally reduced thermoregulation in seabirds. Thin sheens of oil and drilling fluids form around offshore petroleum production structures from currently permissible operational discharges of hydrocarbons. Methodology was developed to measure feather microstructure impacts (amalgamation index or Al) associated with sheen exposure. We collected feather samples from two common North Atlantic species of seabirds; Common Murres (Uria aalge) and Dovekies (Alle alle). Impacts were compared after feather exposure to crude oil and synthetic lubricant sheens of varying thicknesses. Feather weight and microstructure changed significantly for both species after exposure to thin sheens of crude oil and synthetic drilling fluids. Thus, seabirds may be impacted by thin sheens forming around offshore petroleum production facilities from discharged produced water containing currently admissible concentrations of hydrocarbons.

Despite increasing research effort in recent years many fundamental questions remain to be answered before we can effectively manage the issue. One question is whether the greater munber of NIMS thus far documented in temperate waters is real or an artefact of fewer surveys being undertaken in tropical environments. Another one is whether poor taxonomic knowledge of the biodiverse tropics hides NIMS that actually occur there. Extensive taxonomic work in three Pacific localities (Guam, northern Western Australia and Singapore) has been collated in previous papers showing that thew are relatively few NIMS in these biodiverse environments. The present paper replicates investigations for a low latitude environment in southern Florida in the Atlantic Ocean. The focus area includes the extensive Florida Keys coral reef environment. the southern margin of the Everglades on Florida Bay and the major PortMiami. Only 48 NIMS were identified in a literature-based compilation of 4,615 species; 15 species were represented by isolated records and have not established populations, leaving only 33 NIMS that are established or whose status is unknown. Records for Mollusca, the group with the most species (1,153) in the compilation, were individually researched and taxonomically verified. It is argued that the relative paucity of NIMS is not a straightforward temperature-driven tropical/temperate issue, but instead there are biological factor(s) restricting the ability of NIMS to colonise biodiverse environments compared to less diverse areas.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,4,,,1989-8649,,,,,,,,,,,"Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, AustraliaField Museum Nat Hist, Negaunee Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA",,,,2020-09-22,WOS:000566792800002,,

The information obtained was compared to previous data series available for the area affected by the spill. A large data series on plankton variables for the N-NW Spanish coast existed, and therefore a realistic evaluation of the effects by comparison with the range of natural variability could be carried out. We emphasized the evaluation of impact during the spring bloom, the first important biological event after the spill. Some minor changes were observed occasionally, but they did not show any clear pattern and were more related to the natural variability of the ecosystem than to effect of the spill. Plankton community structure did not undergo any changes. Only a few species were more abundant during spring 2003 than in previous years. No significant changes were detected in the planktonic community during productive periods, such as the spring bloom and the summer blooms related to intrusions of East North Atlantic Central Waters. The lack of evidence of the effects of the spill on planktonic communities is discussed in terms of the characteristics of the fuel, the high dynamics of the water masses, the biological mechanisms through which the fuel from the surface waters is transferred to the sea floor and, particularly, the influence of the natural variability by means of large and meso-scale hydrographic processes in the area under study. At the present time it is not possible to determine any minor effects the spill may have had on the plankton owing to the great variability of the planktonic cycles and the short-term impact of the oil from the Prestige on the pelagic system.

Waves, tidal currents, and wind-driven and circulation currents were obtained from oceanographic models to assess the wave and current processes for the broader Bay of Fundy. The wave and current outputs were coupled with observed grain size in a sediment transport model to predict, for the first time, the seabed shear stresses, sediment mobility, and sediment transport patterns for the entire Bay. The root mean square tidal current, highest in the upper Bay (>1.4 m.s(-1)), is reduced to moderate in the central Bay (0.5-0.8 m.s(-1)) and decreases further in the outer Bay (0.2-0.5 m.s(-1)). The maximum tidal current occurs in the Minas Passage and is >5 m.s(-1). The mean significant wave height, in contrast, is the greatest in the outer Bay (similar to 1.3 m) and gradually decreases to the northeast in the central and upper Bay (<0.5 m). Seabed shear in the Bay of Fundy is mostly due to tides, and wave effects are only important in coastal areas. The strongest mean shear velocity of 10 cm.s(-1) occurs in the Minas Passage area. Strong shear velocity of 4-5 cm.s(-1) also occurs in Minas Basin, in the central Bay, and in the narrows around Grand Manan Island. Sediment mobilization in the Bay of Fundy is predominantly by tidal current. Mobilization frequency is >30% of the time over most of the Bay and reaches 100% of the time in some areas. The maximum total-load sediment transport rate under spring tide can reach similar to 5 kg. m(-1).s(-1) and is to the northeast during flood and to the southwest during ebb. Net sediment transport flux, however, is dominantly to the northeast and reaches 2 kg. m(-1).s(-1). Eddies of net transport are found to occur around headlands and at the narrows of Grand Manan Island, largely due to the occurrence of eddies of residual tidal flows.

We therefore combine citizen science data at large scales with the demographic resolution afforded by recently developed, site-structured demographic models. We apply this approach to categorical data generated from citizen science representing species density of two managed reef fishes in the Gulf of Mexico, and use a modified Dail-Madsen model to estimate demographic trends, habitat associations, and interannual variability in recruitment. This approach identifies strong preferences for artificial structure for the recovering Goliath grouper, while revealing little evidence of either habitat associations or trends in abundance for mutton snapper. Results are also contrasted with a typical generalized linear mixed-model (GLMM) approach, using real-world and simulated data, to demonstrate the importance of accounting for the statistical complexities implied by spatially structured citizen science data.

The proposed IMCL determines the specific heat capacity of different ocean locations at multiple epochs. In addition, the conversion of end-of-life vessels into artificial reefs that host open-source disaggregated hardware computing payload is proposed to reduce acquisition costs. The use of disaggregated architecture enables multiple cloud service providers to use limited ocean locations. The formulated metrics are the power usage effectiveness (PUE) and ocean space utilization (OSU).

As tags expire and projects end, researchers must decide whether to maintain their receiver stations, adjust the configuration to accommodate a new scope of research, or remove the stations. We assessed telemetry data from two projects designed to monitor fishes in nearshore and offshore habitats of the eastern Gulf of Mexico to determine the configuration of receiver stations most informative for network scale monitoring. Modeled on the Index of Relative Importance commonly used to analyze fish diets, the Receiver Efficiency Index (REI) allowed us to reduce the size of the two arrays from 59 to 24 and 33 to 21 stations, reductions of 59% and 27%, while retaining more than 75% of all detections. The application of this method has general relevance to understanding the spatial dynamics of these arrays while providing researchers with a quantitative tool to guide decision making that can maximize spatial coverage at the lowest maintenance cost.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,25,0,34,,,0165-7836,1872-6763,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 100 8th Ave Southeast, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USAUniv Florida IFAS Extens, Florida Sea Grant, 1303 17th St West, Palmetto, FL 34221 USABonefish & Tarpon Trust, 135 San Lorenzo Ave,Suite 860, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USAUniv Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, 7922 Northwest 71st St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA",Bonefish & Tarpon Trust,,,2019-01-01,WOS:000451654100018,,

Given the critical role that environmental advocacy groups play in shaping public perceptions of different potential approaches to solving environmental problems and given the recognition that public perception of CCS will influence its advancement, this paper reviews the perspectives and positions of several prominent environmental advocacy groups related to CCS. While several environmental organizations have taken strong positions in favor of biological carbon storage and against the idea of oceanic carbon storage, most environmental groups have been cautiously hesitant in their public stance and assessment of the more advanced concept of injecting captured CO2 underground into natural geologic reservoirs. Concerns that CCS may detract from efforts and funds to support increased use of other existing energy technology alternatives as well as apprehension about ill-defined risks and impacts associated with storing CO2 underground have contributed to the hesitancy to support CCS.",,,,,IEEE EIC Climate Change ConferenceIEEE EIC Climate Change Conference,"MAY 09-12, 2006MAY 09-12, 2006",IEEEIEEE,"Ottawa, CANADAOttawa, CANADA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-4244-0217-5,,,,,,,,,"Clark Univ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000247356600008,,

The idea that abundances of higher taxa, or particular groups of organisms, may be used as surrogates for the total fauna in such studies is explored in this paper using data from the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. The general conclusion is that, in surveys of soft sediment macrofauna in disturbed areas of the North Sea where pollution imposes simple spatial gradients on the benthic communities, little information about inter-sample relationships is lost using data based on family, polychaete species, or polychaete family abundances, rather than species abundances. In more pristine areas where spatial patterns are determined by a number of processes, correlations between calculated diversity indices and similarity in faunal patterns between species and family abundances are still very high, but less so for polychaete species or polychaete family abundances. This suggests that identification to the level of family may be satisfactory in many routine monitoring surveys, and identification of only the polychaetes, either to the level of species or family, may also be a possible alternative if there are clear disturbance gradients in the survey area. Polychaetes are of importance in disturbed areas because the group contains tolerant and intolerant species, and in undisturbed areas because within the taxon species have a greater range of trophic and reproductive strategies than within other taxa. Ultimately it is the distribution of species, their identities, and their interactions with each other and with the environment, that are of interest. The use of surrogates is likely to be most advantageous if it is only the extent of pollution effects from a discrete source that matters, and species level baseline studies have already been completed.",,,,,,,,,137,2,1,0,122,3,151,,,1386-1980,,,,,,,,,,,"Section of Marine Zoology and Marine Chemistry, Department of Biology, University of Oslo, Blindern, N-0316, Oslo, Norway",,,,2000-03-01,BCI:BCI200000311048,,

It is apparent that the lower part of the Bahi Formation, the oldest rock unit examined, reflects a basin margin environment under the influence of freshwater input. Shallow marine, near-shore, inner shelf, suboxic-anoxic conditions, which are first suggested by the uppermost deposits of the Bahi Formation, prevailed for much of the time during deposition of the younger Cretaceous Etel, Rachmat, Sirte and Kalash formations. Shallow supratidal and intertidal sub-environments alternating with deeper environments of shelf embayments associated with a maximum rise in sea level are indicated by the Paleocene Farrud Member of the Beda Formation. The Zelten Formation consists of shallow intertidal and lagoonal facies, and the overlying Paleocene-Eocene Kheir Formation reflects relatively shallow marine sedimentation in mid to outer shelf environments alternating with short-lived, shallow, intertidal-lagoonal to supratidal conditions. The TOC content of the Upper Cretaceous samples examined is mostly moderate (up to 2.04%), the organic matter consisting of Types II and II/III kerogen. Differences in hydrocarbon generation potential are linked to varying proportions of aquatic versus terrigenous organic matter in the samples examined and hence to depositional conditions. Combined geochemical and palynofacies data reflect deposition mainly in weakly reducing to suboxic settings and suggest that immature to early mature gas-prone source rocks are within the Etel, Rachmat and some of the Sirte Formation, and mature oil/ gas-prone source rocks are within the Sirte and Kalash formations.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,0,7,,,0920-4105,1873-4715,,,,,,,,,,"Mansoura Univ, Fac Sci, Geol Dept, Mansoura 35516, EgyptAberystwyth Univ, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3DB, Dyfed, WalesUniv Manchester, Sch Earth Atmospher & Environm Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",,,,2017-09-29,WOS:000410624800013,,

Though there are several proposals for efficient utilization system of MH, challenges still remains in the production enhancement. In this study, a new strategic production model is proposed for oceanic MH extraction and offshore power generation with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). The batch type design is facilitated with vertical well system and warm-up process, which is executed before and during the continuous gas extraction from MH reservoir. The system includes a methane gas extraction system, power generation system and CO2/H2O injection system. The re-injection of hot water/CO2 sustains the sensitive heat for the dissociation extraction process in a typical strategic production lifecycle. Numerical simulation shows that this design is possible to enhance the long-term gas production. Thermal balance and sensitive heat supply are proved to be of special importance for production rate. The analysis of power generation and CCS system show a general efficiency of 40% for this design. The selection of amine use, the effect of injection conditions and the feasibility of the proposed extraction/generation system are also discussed into detail in this study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To better understand the factors behind this variability we investigate the relative importance of geomorphic and vegetation attributes to variability in the belowground C stocks of saltmarshes in New South Wales (NSW), southeast Australia. Based on the analysis of over 140 sediment cores, we report mean C stocks in the surface metre of sediments (mean +/- SE = 164.45 +/- 8.74 Mg C ha(-1)) comparable to global datasets. Depth-integrated stocks (0-100 cm) were more than two times higher in fluvial (226.09 +/- 12.37 Mg C ha(-1)) relative to marine (104.54 +/- 7.11) geomorphic sites, but did not vary overall between rush and non-rush vegetation structures. More specifically, sediment grain size was a key predictor of C density, which we attribute to the enhanced C preservation capacity of fine sediments and/or the input of stable allochthonous C to predominantly fine-grained, fluvial sites. Although C density decreased significantly with sediment depth in both geomorphic settings, the importance of deep C varied substantially between study sites. Despite modest spatial coverage, NSW saltmarshes currently hold approximately 1.2 million tonnes of C in the surface metre of sediment, although more C may have been returned to the atmosphere through habitat loss over the past approximately 200 years.

At the same time, human pressure on the oceans, both from land- and atmospheric-based sources and at sea, as well as from climate change, has led to unprecedented levels of stress on the oceans. The concept of ocean governance has developed as a response to this. This chapter explores ocean governance from the interdisciplinary perspectives of law and human geography.We trace the development of ocean governance from first practices and legal concepts up to the emergence of contemporary ocean governance in recent decades and explore how it departs from traditional practices. Zonal and sectoral approaches, as well as their underlying norms, are discussed. We then take a more critical stance to shed light on the role neoliberalism plays in the forming of ocean governance and the effects this paradigm can have on governance outcomes. The cases of fisheries management and ocean grabbing illustrate some possible mechanisms and effects. In addition, the role of commu-nities and indigenous people in ocean governance is discussed.

On Novaya Zemlya conodont samples were collected systematically from four regions that represent a wide transition from (near-shore) shallow to deep depositional environments/settings. Approximately 160 samples contained conodonts. 104 conodont taxa are recognised. Analysis of the distribution of these conodont taxa has resulted in the recognition of 23 local conodont zones and subzones, most of which are assemblage zones. Chronostratigraphic correlation indicates that these zones range from Early Bashkirian (Declinognathodus noduliferus Assemblage Zone) to Late Artinskian (Neostreptognathodus pequopensis Assemblage Zone). In the Carboniferous part of the succession, conodont zones are defined from both shallow and basinal facies. early Permian conodont assemblages obtained from basinal facies are essentially different from coeval assemblages from shallow water deposits. Comparison of conodont assemblages of Novaya Zemlya with zonal assemblages from type sections of the Russian Platform and the Urals has provided precise dating of local stratigraphic units. In addition, correlation of the middle Carboniferous-Lower Permian sections of Novaya Zemlya with those of the Sverdrup Basin (Arctic Canada) and Svalbard is possible based on the defined conodont zones. Conodont Colour Alteration Index (CAI) isopach maps have been prepared for the Middle Carboniferous and Upper Carboniferous-Lower Permian from Novaya Zemlya and the Pechora Sea Shelf. An analysis of these maps allows identification of potentially oil-producing deposits in the Middle Carboniferous-Lower Permian of the Pechora Shelf; potentially gas-producing deposits of this age may occur in the southern and northern areas of Novaya Zemlya.

In the theoretical part of the study, the approaches to defining strategic sustainability were reviewed, and their classification was completed, and the most appropriate definition of strategic sustainability for an offshore oil and gas project was chosen. The method of hierarchy analysis was used for strategic sustainability assessment. Specific criteria have been proposed to reflect the technical, geological, investment, social and environmental characteristics important to the offshore oil and gas project. The strategic sustainability of 5 offshore oil and gas projects was analyzed using an expert survey as part of the hierarchy analysis method.

The majority of its activities are offshore, some occurring in shallow marine areas adjacent to sensitive resources such as coral reefs and mangroves, One of the main issues for the oil and gas industry is continued access to marine acreage. Increasing public concern about the environmental protection of the coastal and marine environment has increased the focus on the various users. This has resulted in the development of statutory and administrative processes, more stringent environmental assessment and operating conditions, and greater scrutiny on the issue of access of proposals to some areas. Detailed environmental assessment and management plans are generated for all drilling and development projects. An environmental risk assessment approach utilising computer modelling, habitat mapping, research and monitoring is used to evaluate the risk of a project on adjacent resources and to obtain government approval. The Wonnich appraisal drilling program, which consisted of two wells drilled from the same surface location situated one kilometre away from an area of high conservation value, will be used as a case study of the risk assessment procedure used by one oil and gas company.

Restoration of these ecosystems is thus a primary activity that requires large volumes of sand to rebuild beach-dune systems and restore wetland habitats. Sand sources have traditionally been sought offshore in the marine environment, but there are problems associated with setbacks from oil and gas infrastructure, presence of muddy overburden, and limited reserves of beach-quality sediments. Fluvial sand sources in channel and point-bar deposits become an attractive alternative for barrier island restoration because of large volumes of relict deposits and because active sand waves are renewable. Results of preliminary geophysical and geotechnical investigations in the lower Mississippi River (south of New Orleans) along a 32-km stretch of the river indicate the presence of at least 23 million cubic meters of usable sediments in seven potential borrow sites. Caveats to assessment and exploitation of river sands include interpretation of vibracores and seismic reflection profiles that include evidence of lateral translation-type bank failures along bendways, lateral slumps, and postdepositional disturbance of strata above -30 m.

The carbonate buildups formed in two main intervals during postrift sequences of the Santonian-Maastrichtian and Paleocene-Middle Miocene, which extend the known periods of carbonate deposit formation in the basin. The formation of carbonate buildups was controlled by the tectonic evolution of the Pernambuco Plateau, which created a series of paleotopographic highs that enabled the establishment of oceanographically and climatically favorable conditions for carbonate formation and deposition.

Dive groups were followed, and their diving times in an adjacent marine protected area (MPA) and surrounding natural coral outcrops were recorded. Time spent inside the MPA did not change. However, in-training divers reduced their times in the MPA and at two adjacent coral outcrops following AR deployment, but they did not alter other elements of their dives; coral transplantation did not affect diving behavior. A dive entry point located at least 90-m from the border of the MPA was sufficient to reduce dive time in the MPA. The AR had only a partial impact on diver behavior.

Therefore, it is common practice to attempt to deter the mammals out of potential danger zones beforehand. Seal scarers are commonly used as a deterrent for harbour porpoises in spite of a lack of clear evidence in support of their effectiveness. We investigated the responses of harbour porpoises to a Lofitech seal scarer by conducting visual observations in conjunction with sound measurements. Porpoise sighting rates within 1 km of the seal scarer significantly decreased to only 1% during seal scarer activity. During 22 trials, when the seal scarer was deployed between 300 m and 3.3 km distance, all observed porpoises always avoided the seal scarer within 1.9 km (translating to sound levels of = 122 dB re 1 mu Pa-rms), avoided the seal scarer half the time within 2.1 to 2.4 km 9119 to 121 dB re 1 mu Pa-rms) and never avoided the seal scarer at distances beyond 2.6 km (<= 118 dB re 1 mu Pa-rms). The closest observed approach distance of a porpoise to the activated seal scarer was 798 m 9132 dB re 1 mu Pa-rms). Thus, the deployment of a Lofitech seal scarer during offshore pile driving activities can greatly reduce the risk of acoustic traumata to harbour porpoises.

We demonstrate the application of the models to assess ecosystem services in a simulation of hill-country afforestation in the Manawatu catchment, which has recently seen increasing soil erosion in the hills leading to sedimentation of waterways.

Here, we aim to model the influence of biophysical conditions on habitat suitability for endangered fin whales Balaenoptera physalus, with a view to informing management in a heavily impacted ocean region.Location: We satellite-tracked the movements of 67 fin whales through the California Current System (CCS), a dynamic eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem in the Northeast Pacific.Methods: We use a multi-scale modelling framework to elucidate biophysical influences on habitat suitability for fin whales in the CCS. Using generalized additive mixed models, we quantify the influence of a suite of remotely sensed variables on broad-scale patterns of occupancy and present the first year-round, high-resolution predictions of seasonal habitat suitability. Further, we model the influence of contemporaneous biophysical conditions on individual-level residence times in high-use habitat.Results: We present evidence of year-round habitat suitability in the southern California Current System, robust to interannual variability, establishing that North Pacific fin whales do not follow the canonical baleen whale migration model. Within the high-use habitat in the Southern California Bight (SCB), individual-level residency in localized areas (n = 16 for > 30 days; n = 4 for > 6 months) was associated with warm, shallow, nearshore waters (> 18 degrees C, < 500 m), with cool waters (14-15 degrees C) occurring over complex seafloor topographies and with convergent (sub) mesoscale structures at the surface.Main Conclusions: Biophysical conditions in the southern CCS generate productive foraging habitats that can support the fin whale population year-round and allow for extended periods of residency in localized areas. High-use habitats for fin whales are colocated with areas of intense human use, including international shipping routes and a major naval training range.

One of the decommissioning options for these platforms is complete removal, requiring the use of explosives to dislodge the support structure from below the seafloor. Off California, this decommissioning option would kill large numbers of platform-associated and commercially important groundfishes that inhabit the bases of the platforms, and may potentially affect regional fish populations. Capturing and translocating fishes before removing a platform might mitigate the effects of platform removal. In this study, we acoustically tagged 79 rockfishes and lingcod from three oil platforms in the east Santa Barbara Channel and translocated them to a natural reef inside a state marine reserve at Anacapa Island to determine whether individuals would home back to their platforms of capture, or take up residency at their new location. Movements between natural and platform habitats were monitored over a two-year period. Twenty-five percent of all tagged fishes translocated to a natural reef returned to their home platforms relatively quickly, traveling distances from 11 km to >= 18 km, in 10.5 h to 17 d. Those that did not home took up residency at Anacapa Island, moved to Santa Cruz Island or out of the range of detection. Although a small proportion of fish (25%) homed back to the platforms, a higher proportion (75%) remained at their platforms of release. Those that homed back to their platform of capture did so relatively quickly (avg 15 +/- 31 d). Lingcod had the highest probability of homing back to their platform of capture, typically doing so in < 1 day. These results suggest that fish translocation may be a successful, but costly mitigation strategy for platforms that require full decommissioning and that some species may be more successfully translocated than others.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,11,0,16,,,0038-3872,2162-4534,,,,,,,,,,"Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",,,,2013-02-22,BCI:BCI201300188586,,

As part of this program, concentrations of trace metals and petroleum hydrocarbons were determined in surface sediments and in trapped sediments before, during, and after drilling had stopped. Barium, a major component of drilling muds, was the only chemical that changed significantly during the period of study. During drilling, barium concentrations in surface sediments increased 30-40% above background. After drilling stopped, barium concentrations decreased but, after 1.5 years, had not approached background concentrations of surface sediments. In trapped sediments, barium concentrations increased 200-300% during drilling but returned to background concentrations within 1 year after drilling had stopped.Hydrocarbon concentrations in sediments from the study area were occasionally elevated, but generally were not consistent with drilling activities. Examination of the petroleum hydrocarbon and PAH distributions indicated that a distinct petroleum signal was occasionally observed in some samples; however, natural seepage rather than drilling discharges is probably responsible for the randomly-elevated hydrocarbon concentrations. The presence of seep-related particles should be recognized in characterizing the ambient hydrocarbon concentrations of sediments in the study area.

Many biodiverse ecosystems are being lost at far higher rates than they are being protected or ecologically restored. At the same time, natural climate solutions offer opportunities to restore biodiversity while mitigating climate change. The Bonn Challenge is a U.N. programme to restore biodiversity and mitigate climate change through restoration of the world's degraded landscapes. It provides an unprecedented chance for ecological restoration to become a linchpin tool for addressing many environmental issues. Unfortunately, the Forest and Landscape Restoration programme that underpins the Bonn Challenge, as its name suggests, remains focused on trees and forests, despite rising evidence that many non-forest ecosystems also offer strong restoration potential for biodiversity and climate mitigation. We see a need for restoration to step back to be more inclusive of different ecosystem types and to step up to provide integrated scientific knowledge to inform large-scale restoration. Stepping back and up will require assessments of where to restore what species, with recognition that in many landscapes multiple habitat types should be restored. In the process, trade-offs in the delivery of different ecosystem services (e.g. carbon, biodiversity, water, albedo, livestock forage) should be clearly addressed. We recommend that biodiversity safeguards be included in policy and implemented in practice, to avoid undermining the biophysical relationships that provide ecosystem resilience to climate change.

Nitrogen was depleted relative to phosphorus throughout most of the year. Increasing nitrogen (6-200% over ambient concentrations) enhanced algal productivity and cover of fast-growing annual algae, grazer, and predator densities, suggesting a three-level bottom-up effect. With increasing nitrogen loading, annual algae increasingly blocked perennial algal recruitment (65-98% decrease) and growth. Grazers counteracted the effects of nutrient enrichment on algal species composition through selective consumption of annual algae. Grazer exclusion had equivalent negative effects on perennial recruitment as a 85% increase in nitrogen loading. Nutrient enrichment increased algal nitrogen content and decreased tissue C:N ratios in spring and summer but not in fall. Carbon storage and nitrogen retention, measured as C and N retained in plant biomass at the end of the growth season, were increased by grazers (C: 39%, N: 24%) but decreased with increasing nitrogen loading (C: -71%, N: -74%).

The variation of incident frequency with time for different types of offshore oil and gas installations, and for different vessel types has been established. A total of 394 records within the period 1980 to 1997 are investigated in this study. The variation of incident frequency with time and seasons, causation factors, incident with respect to geographical distribution, and sea conditions are discussed. The relationship between vessel types, sizes and operations is analysed; operating circumstances, reported primary failure cause, and impart orientation for different vessel types are also described. The statistical analysis reveals that safety culture in terms of good seamanship by vessel masters is probably responsible for mitigating the magnitude of many of the impacts that do occur and also that there is a need for improvement in safety performance.

Many seabirds are of conservation concern, including albatrosses and large petrels (Procellariiformes) which face a major threat from mortality in fisheries. We examine how important areas used by seven of these species breeding at South Georgia change throughout the year, based on tracking data collected between 1991 and 2012, and discuss the implications for spatial management in the region within the current jurisdictional framework.Foraging areas overlapped with a patchwork of national and international management organizations, and areas outside clear jurisdiction. National waters were generally unimportant, besides that of South Georgia. The other exception was Falkland Islands coastal waters, which were important for wandering albatrosses Diomedea exulans during incubation, and were opened for new oil and gas drilling in 2015. The marine protected area established at the South Orkney Islands protects very little habitat used by the tracked seabirds; however, a northern extension of this would benefit a number of species at different breeding stages.The area around South Georgia was important year-round, including in periods when fishing is allowed. A contiguous region to the north of this was also important and here, mechanisms should be improved to ensure compliance with bird bycatch mitigation recommendations. The study highlighted the use of tracking for identifying key areas for pelagic albatrosses and petrels, and the advantages of incorporating these data into a multilateral approach to marine spatial planning to ensure the future conservation of these highly-threatened marine predators.

These fish are susceptible to pressure-related injuries (i.e., barotrauma) during fishing that compromise survival after catch and release. Barotrauma-afflicted fish may not only experience immediate mortality but also delayed mortality after returning to depth. This variability and unknown fate leads to uncertainty in stock assessment models and rebuilding plans. To generate better estimates of immediate and delayed mortality and postrelease behavior, Red Snapper were tagged with ultrasonic acoustic transmitters fitted with acceleration and depth sensors. Unique behavior profiles were generated for each fish using these sensor data that allowed the classification of survival and delayed mortality events. Using this information, we compared the survival of Red Snapper released using venting, nonventing, and descending treatments over three seasons and two depths. Red Snapper survival was highest at cooler temperatures and shallower depths. Fish released using venting and descender tools had similar survival, and both these groups of fish had higher survival than nonvented surface-released fish. Overall, Red Snapper had 72% survival, 15% immediate mortality, and 13% delayed mortality, and all fish suffering from delayed mortality perished within a 72-h period after release. Results from these field studies enhance the understanding of the delayed mortality and postrelease fate of Red Snapper regulatory discards. Moreover, these data support the practice of using venting or descender devices to increase the survival of discarded Red Snapper in the recreational fishery and show that acoustic telemetry can be a valuable tool in estimating delayed mortality.",,,,,,,,,50,0,0,0,45,0,58,,,1942-5120,,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USATexas Tech Univ, Dept Biol, Lubbock, TX 79409 USAUniv Western Sydney, Sch Sci & Hlth, Penrith, NSW 2751, AustraliaBur Ocean Energy Management, 1201 Elmwood Pk Blvd, New Orleans, LA 70123 USA",Bur Ocean Energy Management,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000379769300001,,

Herein we reviewed the phenomenon of free-living corals (coralliths), examined whether they have the capacity to create their own stable habitat in otherwise uninhabitable, poor substrate environments through 'free-living stabilization', and explore their potential ecological role on coral reefs. This stabilization could be achieved by coral settlement and survival on mobile substrate, with subsequent growth into free-living coralliths until a critical mass is reached that prevents further movement. This allows for secondary reef colonization by other coral species. To preliminarily test this hypothesis we provide evidence that the potential to support secondary coral colonisation increases with corallith size. Due to the limited diversity of corallith species observed here and in the literature, and the lack of physiological differences exhibited by coralliths here to static controls, it seems likely that only a small selection of coral species have the ability to form coralliths, and the potential to create their own stable habitat.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,2045-2322,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, James Hutton Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FE, Midlothian, ScotlandLyell Ctr Earth & Marine Sci & Technol, Edinburgh EH14 4AP, Midlothian, ScotlandHeriot Watt Univ, Sch Energy Geosci Infrastruct & Soc, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, ScotlandKAUST, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia",Lyell Ctr Earth & Marine Sci & Technol,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000413084800019,29042632,
