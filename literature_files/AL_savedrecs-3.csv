To our knowledge this is the longest systematic dataset on offshore bat migration worldwide. Three-hundred and seventeen call sequences were recorded during typical migration times in spring and autumn and assigned to at least 23 Nathusius pipi-strelles (Pipistrellus nathusius), 3 northern bats (Eptesicus nilssonii) and 2 Leisler's bats (Nyctalus leisleri). Compared to the prevailing wind conditions, more bats than expected were recorded at lower wind speeds and southerly winds. Bats occurred under supporting tailwinds, but also under strong headwinds. In both seasons most bats occurred under winds from the south (i.e.crosswinds), which indicates offshore wind drift. We neither found effects of air pressure, nor of change in air pressure. Most registrations coincided with a dense cover of clouds, fog/low stratus and/or rain. From the structure of echolocation calls it can be concluded that most bats explored the platform rather than just passed it on transfer flights, some even foraged there. We conclude that most of the bats were on migration and attracted by the brightly lit platform and/or sought refuge there. This involves the risk of collisions with offshore wind turbines (which need to be brighter lit at sea than onshore). We assume that a great part of offshore bat migration takes place beyond the range of currently available techniques at greater altitudes than known so far.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,7,0,10,,,0024-7634,0024-7634,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Avian Res Vogelwarte Helgoland, Vogelwarte 21, D-26386 Wilhelmshaven, Germany",,,,2017-11-03,BCI:BCI201700766603,,

In contrast, offshore wind turbines placed on rocky reefs in highly exposed areas are much less common and the impacts on local flora and fauna can only be hypothesized. On the Western coast of Norway, a rocky reef with a highly complex topography has been chosen to be the first full-scale offshore wind farm in the country. Underwater video analyses and multibeam bathymetry data with a generalized linear model were used opportunistically to investigate the influence of geomorphic explanatory variables on the occurrence of selected taxa (algae, sea urchins and sea stars) identified in the study area. Combining video observations and multibeam bathymetry in a generalized linear model revealed that the geomorphic descriptors: aspect, slope, rugosity, and benthic position indexes (BPI), were of significance for algae, sea urchins and sea stars at Havsul and served in showing their habitat preferences. Kelp occurred in areas of high rugosity, on gentle slopes, at elevated areas with a southerly orientation and on the sheltered side of rock or bedrock. Thus, construction disturbance that modify those variables may lead to a change in the area preferred by kelp. Turbines that shade southerly aspects may affect small kelp plants in reducing their available habitat. Sea urchins were more abundant on steep slopes and both sea stars and sea urchins showed a preference for a complex local relief (high rugosity) and heterogeneity in fine and broad elevation (shown by BPI). Thus, foundations and cable route preparation may significantly change the slope, rugosity of BPI broad, which will change the basis for sea urchin populations. It may likewise significantly change the rugosity or BPI (fine or broad), which may change the distribution of sea stars. The combination of video data and models using multibeam bathymetry yields useful information about the potential impacts of the construction of an offshore wind farm on rocky substratum and allows us to generate impact hypotheses that go beyond what could be hypothesized through a mere general knowledge of the area.

To reassure an environmentally acceptable development, regulatory authorities need to make informed decisions even when evidence and experience are scarce. In this study Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) has been applied on a wind farm project in Kattegat, proposed within a spawning ground for the Kattegat cod, a threatened population of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L). Six stressors with potential impacts on cod and related to wind farms were investigated. Three of them - extreme noise from pile driving, noise from vessels, and disturbances due to cable-trenching - are related to the construction phase, while lubricant spills and noise from turbines together with electric fields from cables are related to the operation phase. The ecological risk was derived from the combined likelihood and magnitude of potential adverse effects from stressors to the cod population using a weight-of-evidence (WOE) ranking procedure. Available evidence was evaluated based on its reliability, and contradictory arguments were balanced against each other using evidence maps. The option of performing hazardous construction events (e.g. pile-driving) outside biologically sensitive periods was incorporated in the assessment. It was shown that the construction of the wind farm poses a high risk to cod, as defined by the ranked and combined likelihoods and magnitudes of adverse effects. However by avoiding particular construction events during the cod recruitment period ecological risks can be significantly reduced. Specifically for this case, ecological risks are reduced from high to low by avoiding pile-driving from December through June, which confirms previous indications that pile-driving is the most ecologically hazardous activity of offshore wind power development. Additional risk reduction is achieved by avoiding cable trenching from January through May. The study thus illustrates the effectiveness of time-planning for risk reduction. Importantly, the study illustrates how combined ERA and WOE methods can be valuable for handling uncertainties of environmental impacts within offshore industrial development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The off-coast remoteness of the windfarms, particular environmental conditions, limitations in offshore structure access, working in heights and depths, and the vast extent of the offshore windfarms cause significant challenges for offshore rescue. Emergency response systems comparable to onshore procedures are not fully established yet. Further, rescue from offshore windfarms is not part of the duty of the German Maritime Search and Rescue Organization or SAR-Services due to statute and mandate reasons. Scientific recommendations or guidelines for rescue from offshore windfarms are not available yet.The present article reflects the current state of medical care and rescue from German offshore windfarms and related questions. The extended therapy-free interval until arrival of the rescue helicopter requires advanced first-aid measures as well as improved first-aider qualification. Rescue helicopters need to be equipped with a winch system in order to dispose rescue personnel on the wind turbines, and to hoist-up patients. For redundancy reasons and for conducting rendezvous procedures, adequate sea-bound rescue units need to be provided. In the light of experiences from the offshore oil and gas industry and first offshore wind analyses, the availability of professional medical personnel in offshore windfarms seems advisible. Operational air medical rescue services and specific offshore emergency reaction teams have established a powerful rescue chain. Besides the present development of medical standards, more studies are necessary in order to place the rescue chain on a long-term, evidence-based groundwork.

From an economic and environmental point of view, this condition is no more sustainable given the high costs for electricity generation and the high level of pollutant emissions. Furthermore, the dependence on fossil fuel represents a risk for the security of the supply of several small developing Countries since they are obliged to import those resources from foreign Countries. The introduction of renewable energy sources in small islands represents a valid solution to solve these problems. In this context, the paper investigates the case of Lampedusa, a small Italian island whose electrical power system is currently totally supplied by diesel power plants. In the paper, the authors investigate the transition toward an economically and technically feasible generating system based on solar, wind and sea wave plants, to achieve specific targets of decarbonization. Commercial technologies are adopted for the exploitation of solar and wind sources, while sea wave plants are based on an innovative device, currently under development at the University of Palermo. A mathematical model is proposed to find the optimal energy mix that can satisfy a fixed share of annual electricity production from renewables, considering the Levelized Cost of Electricity. Finally, the proposed solution is analyzed in order to check the dynamic stability of the power system. The paper shows that, for replacing the 40% of the current electricity demand of Lampedusa, an optimal energy mix comprising 1509 kW from photovoltaic plants, 2100 kW from wind turbines and 640 kW from wave energy converters is needed. In this way, the actualized cost for the electricity production could be reduced to 0.260 V/kWh from the current value of 0.282 V/kWh. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The next generation turbines will produce 12 megawatts or more. In the summer of 2016 five of these turbines were installed in the coastal waters of Rhode Island. They are representative of the latest in a constantly evolving series of WTGs. As manufacturers continue to develop more powerful turbines, larger and larger specialized vessels will be needed to lift the components at assembly sites offshore. The process these vessels use to build America's offshore windfarms will need to be different from the approach normally used at sites outside the U.S. This is due in part to regulatory restrictions imposed by the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, which is more commonly known as the Jones Act. As it pertains to offshore windfarm construction, the Jones Act prohibits foreign-flagged vessels, (vessels built outside the United States) from moving cargo between two U.S. ports. Under the law, an offshore windfarm within territorial waters is considered a U.S. port. Therefore, employing a foreign built windfarm construction vessel to transport components from a nearby port to the construction site, as it typically does, violates the Jones Act. Although the Jones Act might appear to be a deterrent to the development of offshore wind in the U.S., it is not. The developers of the Rhode Island's Block Island Wind Farm (BIWF) used a combination of U.S. and foreign-flagged vessels to construct BIWF, while remaining in compliance with the law. This paper reviews the approach used at Block Island and discusses how it can be applied to future projects. An analysis of alternatives for various vessel fleet combinations that can be used for this purpose is provided. The analysis is based on results produced by a throughput and scheduling model developed by the authors. The model leverages the experience gained during the construction of BIWF, and was validated with data collected during the project. The alternatives include scenarios utilizing existing vessels modified for windfarm construction service, foreign-flagged windfarm construction vessels, and new vessels specifically built for the U.S. market.

Seabird use of wind energy is an under-appreciated aspect of seabird ecology. Using data from 114 cruises spanning the Southern Ocean, Peru Current, California Current and Equatorial Pacific from 1976 to 2006, we evaluate the effect of wind speed and direction on two key characteristics of seabird behavior, flight height and flight behavior. We used cluster analysis to partition 104 seabird species into morphological groupings based on degree of divergence in morphology from Pennycuick's standard seabird, with subgroups evident among and within flappers, glide-flappers, and flap-gliders. Gliders, sea-anchor soarers and soarers showed no such divergence in morphology within their respective groups. Morphological grouping was in accord with foraging ecology, facilitating foraging behavior. Seabird flight height and behavior varied among groups and subgroups and changed as a function of wind speed and direction relative to travel, with the probability of more gliding and flying above 10 m increasing as wind speed increased. Most of the glide-flappers, flap-gliders and gliders, especially, would be highly vulnerable to offshore wind-generating facilities, as their flight heights bring them well within the blade-swept zone of typical turbines when winds are strong, and their more prevalent gliding makes them less maneuverable than flappers.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,19,0,27,,,1018-3337,2074-1235,,,,,,,,,,"HT Harvey and Associates Ecol Consultants, 983 Univ Ave,Bldg D, Los Gatos, CA 95032 USA",,,,2016-01-22,BCI:BCI201600151119,,

Due to safety reasons, these operations are normally performed within specific sea state limits, which are derivedfrom numerical modelling and analysis of hazardous events. In view of the uncertainties in the assessment of structural responses under stochastic environmental conditions, these limiting curves correspond to a target structural failure probability recommended in offshore standards (for example, 10-4 per operation as specified by DNV-GL). However, one of the main limitations is that these curves do not reflect site specific safety assessment. The current paper presents a novel methodology for assessing the structural safety level of marine operations from a long-term perspective. The methodology includes estimation of extreme response distribution under all possible operational sea states (i.e. the operational domain under the limiting sea states) for a given offshore site and is compared to the response limit to obtain an average failure probability. A case study is also presented for a blade root mating process onto preassembled hub using a jack-up crane vessel and risk of impact between root and hub is considered critical. Global time -domain simulations are performed using multibody dynamics, and extreme value distributions for impact velocities are derived for different wind-wave conditions. The allowable impact velocity between the blade root and the hub is determined by an explicit finite element analysis of the damage at the blade root. Finally, the average failure probabilities considering the operational domain are obtained for four different European offshore sites and are compared to the target level of structural failure probability considered for the limiting sea states.",,,,,"38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)","JUN 09-14, 2019JUN 09-14, 2019","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine EngnASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn","Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLANDUniv Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLAND",7,1,0,0,0,0,7,,,2153-4772,,978-0-7918-5878-3,,,,,,,,,"NTNU, Dept Marine Technol, Trondheim, NorwayUniv Adger, Dept Engn Sci, Grimstad, NorwayNTNU, Dept Mech Engn, Trondheim, Norway",,,,2020-03-11,WOS:000513071100074,,

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 fishers, mostly based out of Block Island or Point Judith, Rhode Island (US), in the summer and fall of 2017. During the interviews, fishers were asked about their perceptions of changes in the marine ecology of the wind farm area during and after the offshore wind turbines were constructed, and how their activities in the area have changed since the wind farm was installed. Results indicate that there were perceived impacts of the BIWF on the local ecosystem and the behavior of the marine resource users. For some recreational fishers, the wind farm functioned as a destination or target and served as an artificial reef for spearfishing. For some commercial fishers, the increase in recreational fishing due to the establishment of the BIWF crowded out commercial fishers in these areas.

A group of tidal current turbines distributed in a site in ocean is called a tidal turbine farm. Among all tidal current energy extraction schemes, turbine farm is regarded as among the most promising turbine configurations; in fact, of turbine farms are extensively employed in the wind power industry. Wind farm planning and modeling approaches cannot be fully transferred to tidal farms, however, because of the complexities involved in modeling the underwater tidal turbine. This study develops a framework for planning a tidal turbine farm system with vertical axis tidal current turbines. This framework is intended to be used by energy planners in the early design stage. An approach for selecting the optimal design among alternative tidal turbine farm designs is proposed whereby the attractiveness of the alternatives is evaluated based on cost effectiveness. Where possible, experience gained from analysis of existing offshore wind farms is applied. The state of the art of tidal turbine design and wind farm planning are reviewed, and a planning framework for selecting the optimal tidal farm design is provided by identifying the important mathematical modeling procedures and elements. Considering the particular design of the vertical axis tidal turbine, a simplified relationship of turbine distribution and turbine farm efficiency is developed.

The most recent grid codes dictate the quality of the possible power at the wind farm level to be assessed within 1-min intervals for offshore wind power plants. Therefore, the necessity of a fast and reliable wake model is more prominent than ever.Here we investigate the performance of two engineering wake models with 1-sec resolution SCADA data on three different offshore wind farms, given the quantified input uncertainty. The preliminary results show that, even wind farm specific training of the model parameters might fail to comply with the strict criteria stated in the grid codes, especially for the layouts with significant wake losses. In order to tackle the inadequacy of the engineering wake models to capture some of the dynamics in the wind farm flow due to the embedded assumptions, purely data-driven techniques are evaluated.

Fatigue crack lengths were monitored by back face strain (BFS), DCPD and ACPD. A regression model was derived through the BFS method to express strain values as a function of crack length to width ratio. The effectiveness of BFS method is particularly demonstrated in the simulated marine environment. Within the range of test frequencies, crack growth rates in simulated seawater when compared to the equivalent air test revealed environmental reduction factors of 2 and 4 at lower and higher values of stress intensity factors respectively.

There is an increasing interest in articulating the added values of the creation of artificial hard bottom habitats through the construction of offshore renewable energy devices, for the benefit of fisheries management and conservation. The Lysekil Project is a test park for wave power located about 100 km north of Gothenburg at the Swedish west coast. A wave energy device consists of a linear wave power generator attached to a foundation on the seabed, and connected by a wire to a buoy at the surface. Our field experiment examined the function of wave energy foundations as artificial reefs. In addition, potentials for enhancing the abundance of associated fish and crustaceans through manufactured holes of the foundations were also investigated. Assemblages of mobile organisms were examined by visual censuses in July and August 2007, 3 months after deployment of the foundations. Results generally show low densities of mobile organisms, but a significantly higher abundance of fish and crabs on the foundations compared to surrounding soft bottoms. Further, while fish numbers were not influenced by increased habitat complexity (holes), it had a significantly positive effect on quantities of edible crab (Cancer pagurus), on average leading to an almost five-fold increase in densities of this species. Densities of spiny starfish (Marthasterias glacialis) were negatively affected by the presence of holes, potentially due to increased predator abundance (e.g. C pagurus). These results suggest a species-specific response to enhanced habitat complexity. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The four key lessons learned that we discuss are: 1) Identifying the area over which biological effects may occur to inform baseline data collection and determining the connectivity between key populations and proposed wind energy sites, 2) The need to put impacts into a population level context to determine whether they are biologically significant, 3) Measuring responses to wind farm construction and operation to determine disturbance effects and avoidance responses, and 4) Learn from other industries to inform risk assessments and the effectiveness of mitigation measures.

The RDS is in essence a spar, and so stability in operation is achieved by having the center of gravity below the center of buoyancy. Spars thus need a relevant draft and some ballast at their bottom. The RDS instead, and compared to classic spars, increases the mass below the center of buoyancy to substantially reduce the draft. This counter-intuitive approach considerably increases the overall mass of the solution. But fortunately this additional mass can be provided by cost-effective solid ballast. In the same way gravity-based structures weigh much more than jackets or monopiles yet they can still be economically feasible, the RDS is considerably heavier than classic spars. Thereby, the RDS can have the benefits of reduced draft solutions like semis while keeping the inherent simplicity of spars.The RDS concept replaces the main cylinder of classic spars by a shorter one, which is in turn held by a large caisson at the bottom of the floater. This allows the assembly of the Wind Turbine (WT) onshore and gives to the RDS enough floating stability to perform the Transport and Installation (T&I) marine operations with a significant reduction of auxiliary means. The proposed floater is made of concrete. It supports an 8 MW turbine in a generic North Sea offshore location. Besides and like in some semis, the unit is fitted with an Active Ballast System (ABS) used to compensate the environmental mean loads (mainly the WT mean thrust).In the paper, a parametric design process is used to obtain the platform main dimensions. The intact stability, both in operation and during all marine operations phases, is checked taking into consideration reasonable design margins. The dynamic response of the RDS to extreme wind, waves and currents is also analyzed. A state-of-the-art seakeeping program coupled with a simplified aerodynamic load model accounts for the effect produced by the wind dynamics on the unit response. The performance of the platform in operation is similar to that of classic spars. Therefore, the paper focuses on the study of the survival conditions. Since the platform cross section is high, survival current loads become differentiating. The dynamic loads at the mooring lines are thus analyzed to assess their feasibility in severe storm environmental conditions, which rule over the mooring design.",,,,,"37th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering37th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 17-22, 2018JUN 17-22, 2018","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","Madrid, SPAINMadrid, SPAIN",5,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,2153-4772,,978-0-7918-5131-9,,,,,,,,,"Seaplace, Madrid 28016, Spain",Seaplace,,,2018-11-29,WOS:000449724700076,,

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) national oil consumption is increasing by 7% annually. If this growth rate continues, local demands will be doubled in a decade. This study has covered various renewable energy solutions such as solar thermal hybrid solutions, photovoltaic cells/arrays, and wind turbines. A selection of possible applications of sustainable buildings, wind farming, solar energy, and their futures are discussed. From the crisis viewpoint of energy and environment safety, architectural trends have shifted toward sustainability demands. Energy and ecology were impetus to improve the residents' life quality and health standards. The climate/building correlation has been established to observe the response between both of them. Five distinguished coastal locations in KSA have given the consideration for wind farms, where meteorological data have been recorded since 1970. In contrast to the hot and irksome weather, water misting systems are elaborated to settle a soothing atmosphere. The results are noticed for evaporation and robbing the excessive heat. It is known that health is dependent on clean and unpolluted air, and the pollution has a threat for public health everywhere. So, an induction of renewable energy future has been considered. Gas turbine technology is also discussed as it accounts for about half of the overall capability of the KSA's power generation. Temperature, humidity, and pressure conditions have been accounted as important factors that affect gas turbine performance to produce electricity. An outlook of domestic energy cost is also reviewed. Furthermore, this study has focused on the necessity of maintaining a green and clean environment as well as a climate of lowest dust content. Reference prices concept has been clearly comprehended and understood. The contradiction of real opportunities and marginal costs has been explained.

Today, the reliable and stable operation of the Danish transmission system is based on the voltage and frequency control carried out at central, conventional power plants. Moreover, the control of some larger decentralized combined heat and power units is activated for voltage control and system balancing, which is specific for the Danish system. In the years to come, according to the government's goal of increasing the share of renewable energy sources in the Danish power system, the share of large offshore windfarms in the Danish power generation mix will increase greatly, replacing central power plants, including their control characteristics during periods of strong winds. Large offshore windfarms must therefore provide the transmission system with the necessary voltage and frequency control, e.g. ancillary services, and ensure secure operation of the power system through their contribution to system service. Danish experience, based on the operation of a system with two large offshore windfarms and several smaller ones, has shown that the efficient use of windfarms' reactive power and voltage control for the on-land transmission system might be limited by several factors. Among such limiting factors ore the reactive power and current capability limits of the electronic power converters and switchable capacitor banks of the offshore wind turbines, which are smaller than those of central power plants measured per unit of the active power rating. Combine this with the use of AC cables, tens of kilometres long, to connect the large offshore windfarms to the on-land transmission system, the reactive power range available to the transmission system gets poor. The Transmission System Operator should already take such limiting factors and alternative solutions for efficient reactive power and voltage control, such as incorporation of a reactive power compensation unit at the on-land point of connection or evaluation of a Voltage Sourced Converter-High Voltage Direct Current instead of an AC connection, into consideration during the planning phase for a windfarm connection.

The study shows that, although waves and winds are generally strongly correlated, in some conditions their correlation is lower and the combined energy harvesting more interesting. As spatial conflicts of sea use and demand for maritime space are increasing, the development of the marine renewable energy sector needs to be evaluated in the perspective of the cumulative pressures deriving from present activities or expected from future developments. The evaluation of areas of potential conflicts among human activities, environmental vulnerabilities and marine renewable developments may facilitate the early development of mitigation actions and negotiations between stakeholders. In this study the opportunity of co-locating offshore wind turbines and wave energy converters is analyzed through a spatial planning approach. Both the potential for combining different renewable technologies, and the impact associated to such development was considered in the context of the existing pressures (e.g., naval traffic; mariculture activities; submarine cables routes; dredge spoils dumping; offshore activities; windfarms and ocean energy projects) and vulnerabilities (Marine Protected Areas, Key habitat presence) through quantitative indicators. The portion of Tyrrhenian coast south of Elba island, the northern-western Sardinian coast, and the southern Adriatic and Ionian coastal waters appear to be the most suitable sites. Moreover, the study presents a spatial quantitative methodology to identify sites of potential interest for the development of the marine renewable energy sector in the perspective of cost-effectiveness and environmental impact minimization.",,,,,,,,,30,1,0,0,0,0,30,,,2296-598X,,,,,,,,,,,"Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn DICA, Milan, ItalyCoNISMa Interuniv Natl Consortium Marine Sci, Rome, ItalyUniv Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Engn, Averse, Italy",,,,2019-05-20,WOS:000467007800002,,

The scour process is studied by subjecting the monopile to a time varying current, which enables a properly down-scaled experiment from the boundary layer and scour perspective. It is shown how the scaled experiments corresponds to real life idealized tsunami cases with periods ranging from 10 to 40 min. It is then shown that the boundary layers of the model tsunami are well described by recently developed empirical relations for tsunami boundary layers. By subjecting the monopile to several successive tsunami waves the scour process is shown to occur in a stepwise cumulative fashion, with the final equilibrium scour depth tending to the depth limited steady current limit. It is shown that the entire scour development can reasonably be predicted by a recently developed simple engineering model.

Those artificial structures provide different services at the expenses of habitat loss and a range of widely documented ecological impacts. Limpets are keystone species that are worldwide established in these artificial habitats. However, little is known about the impact of artificial coastal defence structures on the diet of limpets. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate if different kinds of artificial structures (cubes, rip-raps, seawalls and tetrapods) across a geographical gradient (western to eastern Alboran Sea), could affect the food consumption of the limpet Patella caerulea by using carbon and nitrogen isotopes analysis. Our results suggested that for certain localities, there was a shift in the trophic niche of P. caerulea inhabiting artificial substrates in comparison with the nearest natural rocky shore. However, patterns were not consistent for all localities and different types of artificial structures, which reinforces the importance of considering local scales for conservation and management purposes. Finally, delta N-15 ratio in P. caerulea is a good indicator of eutrophication at regional scales, by showing a gradient of enrichment in the limpet tissues from oligotrophic to eutrophic waters within the Alboran Sea.

We derived a version of PBR that includes an Allee effect (i.e., small population size or densities limiting population growth rates). We found that PBR becomes less conservative when it fails to consider an Allee effect. Specifically, sustainable harvest and take levels based upon PBR with an Allee effect were between approximately 51% and 66% of levels based upon PBR without an Allee effect. Managers and biologists using PBR may need to consider the limitations if an Allee effect may be present in the species being modeled.

Species may also be newly observed in a geographical area due to range shifts, generally in association with climate change. Artificial structures are considered to be either man-made materials or natural materials shaped or displaced to serve a specific function for human activities. All types of artificial structures are currently increasing dramatically in coastal zones due to increasing human populations on coastlines. Most of the significant marine vectors and pathways involve mobile artificial structures and are reviewed here. These include shipping (ballast water and hull fouling) and aquaculture, including stock transfer and unintentional introductions, all of which can move species into new biogeographical provinces. Some types of structures frequently move long distances but have low fouling loads (e.g., commercial shipping), whereas others (e.g., barges and pontoons) can be hyperfouled due to long stationary periods such that when moved they transport mature fouling communities. We also examine the presence of alien marine species on static (immobile) artificial structures, which support different communities from those on natural hard substrata. We consider the role of these structures, such as coastal defences, artificial reefs, and offshore platforms, in the dispersal and abundance of alien species. Marinas include both mobile and immobile structures and are apparently particularly favourable habitats for many aliens. For example, in coastal North America approximately 90% of the alien species inhabiting hard substrata have been reported from docks and marinas. Detailed case studies of alien marine species (two seaweeds and four invertebrates) are provided, with an analysis of their origin, vectors of transport, habitat in the introduced range, and potential impact. Although there are exceptions, a large majority of marine alien species seem to be associated, at least for some of the time, with artificial structures. It is clear that artificial structures can pave the way and act as stepping stones or even corridors for some marine aliens, as do urban areas, roads and riparian environments in terrestrial ecosystems. The observed acceleration of spread rates for marine invasions over the course of the last two centuries may partly be a result of the increase of artificial structures in coastal environments coupled with greater activity of vectors.",,,,,,,,,165,0,0,0,144,2,170,,,0078-3218,,978-1-4398-8998-5,,,,,,,,,"Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North IrelandScottish Assoc Marine Sci, Scottish Marine Inst, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, ScotlandKlaipeda Univ, Coastal Res & Planning Inst, Klaipeda, LithuaniaBangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, WalesAix Marseille Univ, Mediterranean Inst Oceanog, F-13288 Marseille 09, France",,,,2012-01-01,WOS:000309143700004,,

One of the first steps to be undertaken is the development of floating structures to support either wind turbines or measurement devices for the proper characterization of wind energy resources. The use of floating devices for measuring wind speed involves a number of uncertainties not presented by seabed fixed systems. These sources of uncertainty or error are present both in instantaneous wind measurements and averaged (10min or hourly) values because of (i) variability in the measurement height, (ii) the tilt of the anemometer and (iii) the relative velocity between the anemometer and the wind, among others. In this paper, a methodology for assessing the error in the wind measurement characterization because of the movement of a floating meteorological mast is presented. By the numerical simulation of a floating mast, the short- and long-term error in the characterization of the wind at different heights has been evaluated. In general, the error because of the tilt can reach up to 80% of the total error; the error because of the variation of the vertical position of the anemometer reaches values of up to 15% in some cases; moreover, the error associated with the relative velocity between the anemometer and the wind, for averaged values, is significantly less. Finally, it can be concluded that the total error is lower than 0.5% for 10min averaged wind speed of up to 24m/s.

As a first indication of the possible effects of this large scale habitat creation on faunal stocks settling on hard substrata, we compared selected taxa of the mobile demersal megafauna (decapods and fish) associated with the foundation of an offshore research platform (a wind-power foundation equivalent) with those of five shipwrecks and different areas of soft bottoms in the southern German Bight, North Sea. When comparing the amount of approximately 5000 planned wind-power foundations (covering 5.1 x 10(6) m(2) of bottom area) with the existing number of at least 1000 shipwrecks (covering 1.2 x 10(6) m(2) of bottom area), it becomes clear that the southern North Sea will provide about 4.3 times more available artificial hard substratum habitats than currently available. With regard to the fauna found on shipwrecks, on soft substrata and on the investigated wind-power foundation, we predict that the amount of added hard substrata will allow the stocks of substrata-limited mobile demersal hard bottom species to increase by 25-165% in that area. The fauna found at the offshore platform foundations is very similar to that at shipwrecks. Megafauna abundances at the foundations, however, are lower compared to those at the highly fractured wrecks and are irregularly scattered over the foundations. The upper regions of the platform construction (5 and 15 m depth) were only sparsely colonized by mobile fauna, the anchorages, however, more densely. The faunal assemblages from the shipwrecks and the foundations, respectively, as well as from the soft bottoms clearly differed from each other. We predict that new wind-power foundations will support the spread of hard bottom fauna into soft bottom areas with low wreck densities. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The risk of seabirds colliding with offshore wind turbines is influenced by flight height, and flight height data usually come from observers on boats, making estimates in daylight in fine weather. GPS tracking provides an alternative and generates flight height information in a range of conditions, but the raw data have associated error. Here, we present a novel analytical solution for accommodating GPS error. We use Bayesian state-space models to describe the flight height distributions and the error in altitude measured by GPS for lesser black-backed gulls and great skuas, tracked throughout the breeding season. We also examine how location and light levels influence flight height. Lesser black-backed gulls flew lower by night than by day, indicating that this species would be less likely to encounter turbine blades at night, when birds ability to detect and avoid them might be reduced. Gulls flew highest over land and lowest near the coast. For great skuas, no significant relationships were found between flight height, time of day and location. We consider four collision risk windows, corresponding to the airspace swept by rotor blades for different offshore wind turbine designs. We found the highest proportion of birds at risk for a 22-250 m turbine (up to 9% for great skuas and 34% for lesser black-backed gulls) and the lowest for a 30-258 m turbine. Our results suggest lesser black-backed gulls are at greater risk of collision than great skuas, especially by day. Synthesis and applications. Our novel modelling approach is an effective way of resolving the error associated with GPS tracking data. We demonstrate its use on GPS measurements of altitude, generating important information on how breeding seabirds use their environment. This approach and the associated data also provide information to improve avian collision risk assessments for offshore wind farms. Our modelling approach could be applied to other GPS data sets to help manage the ecological needs of seabirds and other species at a time when the pressures on the marine environment are growing.

The number of wind farms is increasing worldwide. Despite their purported environmental benefits, wind energy developments are not without potential adverse impacts on the environment, and the current pace and scale of development proposals, combined with a poor understanding of their impacts, is a cause for concern.2. Avian mortality through collision with moving rotor blades is one of the main adverse impacts of wind farms, yet long-term studies are rare. We analyse bird fatalities in relation to bird abundance, and test several factors which have been hypothesized to be associated with bird mortality.3. Bird abundance was compared with collision fatality records to identify species-specific death risk. Failure time analysis incorporated censored mortality data in which the time of event occurrence (collision) was not known. The analysis was used to test null hypotheses of homogeneity in avian mortality distribution according to several factors.4. There was no clear relationship between species mortality and species abundance, although all large-bird collision victims were raptors and griffon vulture Gyps fulvus was most frequently killed. Bird mortality and bird abundance varied markedly among seasons, but mortality was not highest in the season with highest bird abundance. Mortality rates of griffon vultures did not differ significantly between years.5. Bird collision probability depended on species, turbine height (taller = more victims) and elevation above sea level (higher = more victims), implicating species-specific and topographic factors in collision mortality. There was no evidence of an association between collision probability and turbine type or the position of a turbine in a row.6. Synthesis and applications. Bird abundance and bird mortality through collision with wind turbines were not closely related; this result challenges a frequent assumption of wind-farm assessment studies. Griffon vulture was the most frequently killed species, and species-specific flight behaviour was implicated. Vultures collided more often when uplift wind conditions were poor, such as on gentle slopes, when thermals were weak, and when turbines were taller at higher elevations. New wind installations and/or repowering of older wind farms with griffon vulture populations nearby, should avoid turbines on the top of hills with gentle slopes.",,,,,,,,,160,0,0,0,146,0,184,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"CSIC, Estac Biol Donana, Seville 41013, SpainNat Res Ltd, Banchory Business Ctr, Banchory AB31 5ZU, Kincardine, Scotland",Nat Res Ltd,,,2008-12-01,WOS:000260257800017,,

The wind farm consists of 32 Senvion 6XM152 turbines. The installation took place between August 2019 and May 2020. An offshore wind turbine undergoing installation is interesting from a research point of view for several reasons: Simple geometry: turbine foundation and tower are both rotationally symmetric steel tubes. Rotational symmetry also leads to (approximate) isotropical structural characteristics in the plane normal to tower and foundation. High Reynolds number flow: Assuming a tower diameter of 6 m, and average wind speeds ranging from 5 m/s to 12 m/s under installation conditions, Reynolds numbers range from 4.5 million to 10.5 million. Wave loading under full-scale conditions. Practical relevance to improving the competetivity of offshore wind. For fluid mechanics, closely monitoring offshore wind turbines under wind and wave loading thus compares to a full-scale experiment. Monitoring 32 turbines undergoing installation thus enables the measurement a broad spectrum of different states. The investigation into the data isongoing, questions and contributions are welcome. The current data release still does not include all data. The dataset will thus be updated again in the future with more data to come.First analytic results can be found here: Sander, A, Haselsteiner, AF, Barat, K, Janssen, M, Oelker, S, Ohlendorf, J, and Thoben, K.

Both wind and wave loads are stochastic and are described using statistical models. Wave loads are a function of the sea state. For a sea state, the most important parameters are significant wave heigh H_m0 and Wave peak period T_P. To a lesser extend, wave direction, zero upcrossing period and maximum wave height are also important. Different statistical models can be used to describe the sea state and the relationship between significant wave heigh H_m0 and wave peak period. Most prominent in the North Sea is the JONSWAP spectrum. Wind loads are depending on wind speed, wind direction, shear factor and turbulence intensity. Different statistical models are available to describe the wind spectrum. Wind and wave loads trigger a structural response of the turbine. The structural response depends on the loading spectrum as well as the transfer function. Furthermore, the structural response is strongly depending on the damping and elasticity of the structure. In turbines, damping is typically very low (~ 0.5 - 1.5 %). The response is dominated by the first Eigenfrequency of the turbine. As the turbine is assumed to be rotationally symmetric, the fore-aft and side-side mode are extremely close together if not indistinguishable [1]. The response has the characteristics of a narrow-band random vibration. A narrow-band random vibration is characterized by being dominated by a single, narrow frequency peak (here: first Eigenfrequency). The amplitude envelope follows a Rayleigh distribution and the phase angle is equally distributed between 0 and 2 pi. If viewed from above, the structural response describes a closed curve (orbit) which can be characterized by it shape (eccentricity), mean amplitude and direction. Mathematically speaking, this is a lissajous-figure, where the time series from one response direction is plotted as a function of the time series of the second response direction. [1]: under installation condition Experimental Setup Several locations were used to record data during the installation of the wind farm. They are listed in the following table: helihoist-{1,2}:data recorded from the helicopter hoisting platform atop the turbine nacelle. For most installations, two sensor boxes were deployed to ensure data availability. tp:Measurements from the transition piece sbitroot:Measurements from the blade lifting yoke's blade root side. The Z-axis is aligned to the blade main axis, X-Axis is perpendicular. sbittip:Measurements from the tip side of the blade lifting yoke. Z-axis aligned with the blade main axis, X-axis perpendicular damper:Measurements from the tuned mass damper used during single blade installation towertop:measurements from inside the turbine tower at the upper lift plattform towertransfer: measurements from atop the towers during sail out from the base harbour to the installation site Organization of data For each turbine installation, a separate folder can be found, e.g. turbine-01 for the first and turbine-16 for the 16th turbine. Turbine numbering follows the order of installation. Different data sources are organized in subfolders for each turbine dataset. Unfortunately, not every data source is available for each turbine. Data sources are roughly sorted into categories. The following table lists these categories: location / tom : data from custom build sensor boxes. Data includes acceleration, angular acceleration, magnetic field, gnss recording and rough estimates of the eulerian angles. waves / wmb-sued :Sea state statistics for the installatin period of the turbine. waves / fino :Sea state statistics from the german research platform FINO1located approx. 6 km from the installation site. waves / waveradar :Sea state statstics, recorded by a wave rider wave laser. wind / lidar :high fidelity wind data recorded on the installation vessel during the installation of the wind farm. wind / scada :10 min. mean wind statistisc recorded on wind turbines in the vicinity of the installation site. This data is used in case no LIDAR data is available. wind / anemometer :During some of the installations, anemometers were present on the installation vessel. These recordings are sorted into this sub-subfolder. wind / fino :Additonal wind statistics recorded by the FINO research station. Least recommended for investigations, as these recordings were taken approx. 6 km from the installation site. The zenodo data set includes 16 zip archives (for 16 turbines) as well as one zip archive including environmental data.

These Sensor Boxes were initially designed to measure accelerations and GPS tracks of offshore wind turbine towers undergoing installation. During the installation of the wind farm Trianel Windpark Borkum II they were subsequentially used to track the complete installation with a focus on single blade installation Data from the TOM devices comes as CSV files. The firmware of the boxes was designed, such that data was written into 10 MB sized txt files instead of one large txt file in order to circumvent data corruption due to power loss. However, this leads to a few milliseconds of missing data between log files. Additionally, jitter due to IO-Operations is present in the data as well and data should under all circumstance be resampled befor further analysis. Parameters provided by the TOM devices are listed in the following: epoch :machine readable time stamp based on the unix epoch in UTC [s] runtime : time since last boot of the tom device [ms] latitude : Degrees latitude in decimal writing. For Trianel: [degree due North] longitude :Degrees longitude in decimal writing. For Trianel: [degree due East] elevation :elevation above mean sea level [m] rot_{x,y,z} :Rotational acceleration around the three cartesian axis {x,y,z} of the TOM box.

The wave rider buoy was located at 54 00' 238'' degree North and 6 26' 553'' degree East. In decimals: 54.0031096 North, 6.4425532 East.Based on the raw data, sea state statistics were derived with a return period of 30 minutes. The data comes as csv, column oriented text files. The first line entails parameter names and units and is commented out by a hashbang (unix commentary). The data is a combination of two different data files as provided by the buoy: \*.HIS Data Text File (History of Spectrum parameters) and \*.HIW Data Text File (History of Wave Statistics). This results in the two timestamps in the data file because history of wave statistics data is available immediately after each measurement time period, whereas history of spectrum parameters take approx. 5 minutes to calculate by the buoy and thus have a slightly later time stamp. For actual postprocessing purposes, a third timestamp rounded to full half hour is used. Parameters included in the data files are: epoch: number of seconds since 1st of January 1970 in UTC.

The term offshore aeolic indicates wind turbines installed a few miles from the coasts of seas or lakes, exploiting the exposure of strong currents. The offshore aeolic farms have some disadvantages including the impact of these generators on the landscape, but they produce a minimum visual disturbance compared to onshore aeolic farms. Environmental Impact Assessment (known as the EIA), introduced in Europe by the 377/85/EEC Directive and amended three times, in 1997 (Directive 97/11/EC), in 2003 (Directive 2003/35/EC) and in 2009 (Directive 2009/31/EC), ensures that natural resources, usability and identity of landscapes are not compromised by engineering operations. Planning applications must be accompanied by an Environmental Statement (ES), with the purpose of giving an idea about the effect that the operations will have on the local environment. One of the aim mains of the ES is the understanding of the likely vuisual intrusion of the propsed wind farm, which necessitates the use of visual techniques. A visual technique commonly used is the intervisibility map, normally represented by a two-dimensional map, centered on the location of the wind farm. Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) are used to achieve Thematic Maps obtained wind GIS software. In this paper, GIS tools are used to identify the effects of wind farms on the landscape; in particular, attention is focused on Map Algebra functions and the study of the analysis of the intervisibility of an offshore aeolic farm is tested in a zone in Italy, localized in the Adriatic sea, along the coast of the Apulia and Molise Regions.",,,,,"2nd International Conference on Physical Coastal Processes, Management and Engineering2nd International Conference on Physical Coastal Processes, Management and Engineering","APR 27-29, 2011APR 27-29, 2011","Univ Las Palmas; Wessex Inst Technol; Univ Parthenope; WIT, Transact Ecol & Environm; ASCE UK GrpUniv Las Palmas; Wessex Inst Technol; Univ Parthenope; WIT, Transact Ecol & Environm; ASCE UK Grp","Naples, ITALYNaples, ITALY",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,1743-3541,,978-1-84564-534-2,,,,,,,,,"Univ Naples Parthenope, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Sci, Naples, Italy",,,,2012-11-07,WOS:000309430200008,,

However, the working environment of offshore structures is harsh. When an accident occurs, it causes an adverse social impact and economic loss. Therefore, in the design process of offshore structures, in order to enhance their safety, this is an important problem that needs attention. Reliability-based design and optimisation (RBDO) using saddlepoint approximation (SA) is a powerful method to enhance the reliability of offshore structures. The SA utilises a cumulant generating function and saddlepoint to approximately express the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of a limitstate function.

Despite the fact that the government of Taiwan has started to conduct research to advance technology related to offshore wind turbines, little attention has been paid to the establishment or adjustment of the legal framework and administrative mechanism that would permit effective and streamlined OWP development. Japan's administrative mechanisms are examined, and may be instructive; Lessons from the Japanese model include categorizing OWP under ocean policy rather than energy policy. Furthermore, a Headquarters for Ocean Policy was established as the highest coordinative and decision-making mechanism, and involves the Prime Minister, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, the Minister of Ocean Policy and others, and they usually meet on a regular basis. Thus, a coordinative mechanism similar to that of Japan, be it the newly established Ocean Council or the reinstatement of the Commission for the Promotion of Marine Affairs, could be a workable solution to address current challenges and difficulties faced by the development of OWP in Taiwan.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,0,18,,,0301-4215,1873-6777,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Grad Inst Marine Affairs, Kaohsiung, TaiwanDalhousie Univ, Renewable Energy Storage Lab, Halifax, NS, Canada",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000412034400044,,

When these metropolises are located in semiarid regions, this challenge takes on enormous proportions, and in many situations, there are no sustainable solutions, especially in times of global climate change. One hypothesis to try to mitigate this problem in coastal cities is the underwater adduction of rivers. The objective of this paper was to make the abstraction of drinking water in the mouths of great rivers near semi-arid regions. This water would be led by a pipeline below the water level and would follow the route of the seacoast, where the energy to move the water would be supplied by an axial hydraulic pump embedded in the pipeline by water-cooled electric motors driven by the energy generated from offshore wind turbines. Estimates have been made for the four metropolises in semi-arid regions: Fortaleza-Brazil, Dalian-China, Tel Aviv-Israel, and Gaza-Palestine, where it was possible to calculate economic viability through the Present Worth Value, the internal rate of return, and payback. The results indicated that Fortaleza had economic viability under restrictions. Dalian proved the ideal result. Tel Aviv and Gaza both had great economic viability, but only if Egypt agreed to supply water from the Nile. This paper proved that the management of the water supply for human consumption through the underwater adduction of rivers could be achieved with real clearance for any deficits in the volume of water that due to global climate change are becoming more frequent.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,0,4,,,2073-4441,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Ceara, Agr Engn Dept, 804 Block,Pici Campus, BR-60455900 Fortaleza, Ceara, BrazilMacapa Pilots, St Domingos Marreiro 49, BR-66066210 Belem, Para, BrazilUniv Estadual Campinas, Agr Engn Coll, Ave Candido Rondon 501,Zeferino Vaz Campus, BR-13083875 Campinas, SP, Brazil",Macapa Pilots,,,2018-03-21,WOS:000426775500125,,

Wind and waves induce a cyclic lateral loading on the pile which changes direction corresponding to the meteorological conditions. Cyclic lateral loading on piles results in accumulated displacements, depending on the cyclic load level and load characteristics. The deformation can increase significantly due to a varying loading direction. Under such loading conditions the pile can drift sideways even if the loading is symmetric. Wings attached to the pile shortly below the seabed have been known to reduce deformations on laterally loaded piles as they locally enlarge the diameter on which the soil resistance is activated. They also change the cross-section of the pile from a circular shape to a star-shape. This might reduce the drifting of the pile. A series of large-scale in-situ tests has been carried out in order to identify the effects of changing loading direction as well as the applicability of winged piles to reduce deformations. Two tubular steel piles (one of them equipped with wings) have been installed and subjected to high-cyclic lateral loading from varying directions.

It may cause exposure and free-span of cables, and possibly change the natural frequency of the wind turbine in an unfavourable manner. For these reasons it is important to consider the possible effects of sinking in the scour protection design, and to understand the mechanisms that could lead to unacceptable sinking of the scour protection.The study showed that the sinking is controlled by two mechanisms: removal of sediment adjacent to the pile (destabilizing) and infilling of sediment into the scour protection from the surrounding seabed (stabilizing). The latter mechanism is found to be the strongest, but it might take some time to fill the pores of the scour protection with sediment and during the time delay considerable sinking might take place. This means that the larger the scour protection, the larger the sinking will be (for a given KC-number smaller than approximately 15). The magnitude of the sinking of the scour protection adjacent to a monopile exposed to waves, and combined waves and current, was found to be similar to the current case. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Improved understanding of the mechanisms by which artificial structures influence sedimentary habitats and the scale at which these mechanisms operate is needed to assess impacts of intensifying shoreline armoring on nearshore ecosystems. We examined detrital production on artificial structures and influx into surrounding sedimentary habitat in Puget Sound, Washington. Benthic surveys of hard substrates and drift composition indicated that red macroalgae and encrusting invertebrates were the major producers of detrital material on subtidal artificial structures in the region. Core samples collected at three distances (1, 7, and 15 m) from selected artificial structures revealed that these materials were moving into adjacent sedimentary seascapes and becoming incorporated into the upper layers of sediment. Though detrital influx occurred only in the immediate vicinity of artificial structures, it altered sediment characteristics considerably, increasing the quantity of shell fragments and thus the average grain size, as well as the concentration of red macroalgal detritus in sediments. Furthermore, rapid turnover rates of macroalgal detritus in experimental sediment plots suggested the influx of red macroalgal material from artificial structures was a frequent occurrence. These results indicate that elevated detrital influx is a persistent process in habitats bordering artificial structures in Puget Sound.

However, wind farms may have negative impacts on birds. The East China Coast forms a key part of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, and it is a crucial region for wind energy development in China. However, despite ducks being the dominant animal taxon along the East China Coast in winter and considered as particularly vulnerable to the effects of wind farms, the potential negative impacts of wind farms on duck populations remain unclear. We therefore assessed the effects of wind farms on duck abundance, distribution, and habitat use at Chongming Dongtan, which is a major wintering site for ducks along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, using field surveys and satellite tracking. We conducted seven paired field surveys of ducks inside wind farm (IWF) and outside wind farm (OWF) sites in artificial brackish marsh, paddy fields, and aquaculture ponds. Duck abundance was significantly higher in OWF compared with IWF sites and significantly higher in artificial brackish marsh than in aquaculture ponds and paddy fields. Based on 1,918 high-resolution satellite tracking records, the main habitat types of ducks during the day and at night were artificial brackish marsh and paddy fields, respectively. Furthermore, grid-based analysis showed overlaps between ducks and wind farms, with greater overlap at night than during the day. According to resource selection functions, habitat use by wintering ducks was impacted by distance to water, land cover, human activity, and wind farm effects, and the variables predicted to have significant impacts on duck habitat use differed between day and night. Our study suggests that wintering ducks tend to avoid wind turbines at Chongming Dongtan, and landscape of paddy fields and artificial wetlands adjoining natural wetlands is crucial for wintering ducks.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,2045-7758,,,,,,,,,,,"East China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaInst Ecochongming IEC, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Inst Ecochongming IEC,,,2020-09-01,WOS:000560721900001,32953084,

In 2014, offshore wind capacity in Europe consisted of 8045 MW, with the majority of this connected to onshore grid via High Voltage AC (HVAC) transmission. Wind farms commissioned further offshore ( > 80 km) utilise High Voltage DC (HVDC) transmission for grid interconnection. The deployment and operation of Voltage Sourced Converter (VSC) HVDC substations in harsh offshore environments is still a major challenge for the offshore wind industry. Recently, research studies to reduce the complexity of the offshore network have been undertaken both in industry and in academia, with the primary motivation of reducing cost and increasing reliability.This paper provides a review of Low Frequency AC (LFAC) transmission, which is of significant interest for offshore wind farm integration at a range of 80-180 km. LFAC is an adaptation of HVAC transmission, operated at lower frequency, typically 16.7 Hz. The key advantage of LFAC compared to HVDC is the elimination of the requirement for an offshore converter station, thereby reducing offshore complexity and potentially increasing the operational life of the offshore wind farm. Design challenges are introduced surrounding the design of the 16.7 Hz transmission transformer and associated offshore platform for this potential transmission technology. A comprehensive review of existing research conducted on LFAC and a discussion centreing on the design considerations for offshore LFAC transmission components is presented. The frequency changing converter onshore, offshore LFAC substation and the wind turbine considerations are evaluated in detail. LFAC multi-terminal offshore grids are also considered, as this alternative to HVDC multi-terminal grids may reduce the requirement for multiple offshore converter stations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have neglected the effect of deformable ground by assuming that the soil within skirts behaves rigid during drained loading, but this assumption needs rigorous studies. A series of 3-D finite element analyses has been conducted to investigate directly how the skirt geometry, soil-skirt interface roughness, and deformable plug within the skirt compartment affect the drained skirted foundation capacity and depth factors under uniaxial loading. The results show that the foundation embedment, interface friction, and soil plug placed within the skirt significantly influence the accompanying mechanisms occurring at failure and therefore the uniaxial capacities. The finite element analyses under uniaxial loads are performed for the rough and smooth interface assumptions, to show how the roughness interface influences the ultimate bearing capacities and depth factors and the corresponding failure mechanisms in different soil profiles.

To date within the United Kingdom (UK) a number of demonstrator projects have been constructed covering wind, wave and tidal generation. However, only offshore wind has been developed at large-scale at present as part of two rounds of commercial development of offshore wind farms (OWFs). In June 2008, The Crown Estate, responsible for licensing seabed use, announced proposals for a third round of offshore wind farms to develop an additional 25 GW of energy to the 8 GW already planned for under Rounds 1 and 2. The size of these Round 3 developments will vary, but the largest of these zones will involve the construction of around 2500 seabed foundation structures.Under Round 1 and 2 developments monopile and jacket type foundations have been used, although several other European (non UK) wind farms have been built using gravity base foundations. For a wind turbine the foundations may account for up to 35% of the installed cost. Therefore, one of the future challenges for large volume installation of offshore wind is the control and minimization of these costs.For tidal energy devices one of the principal requirements for many of the devices proposed is their placement in areas of strong tidal energy, and this has implications not only for the stability of the foundation option, but also for the construction methodology.Similarly wave energy devices are designed to be located in shallow, coastal environments as either floating or bottom mounted systems. These devices, by design, are intended to be located in environments with strong wave action. This may be substantial during storm events, which has implications for the integrity of the anchoring system keeping the wave device on station or the design of the device if it is seabed mounted.This paper will explore the lessons learnt from existing offshore wind farm developments as this represents the principal body of collected monitoring data. Using these data the paper will outline some of the challenges facing the offshore renewable industry in respect of the foundation designs and specifically the requirements for scour hazard assessment using the combined experience from those developments currently operational or under construction.",,,,,"30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2011JUN 19-24, 2011","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Rotterdam, NETHERLANDSRotterdam, NETHERLANDS",6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,,,978-0-7918-4437-3,,,,,,,,,"HR Wallingford, Wallingford OX10 8BA, Oxon, England",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000314736400096,,

The adverse working environment may lead to massive operating and maintenance costs of turbines. Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for turbine inspection is considered as a viable alternative to manual inspections. An important objective of automated UAV inspection is to minimize the flight time of the IJAVs to inspect all the turbines. A first contribution of this paper is thus formulating an optimization problem to compute the optimal routes for turbine inspection satisfying the above goal. On the other hand, the limited computational capability on UAVs can be used to increase the power generation of wind turbine. Power generation from the turbines can be optimized by controlling the yaw angle of the turbines. Forecasting wind conditions such as wind speed and wind direction is crucial for solving both optimization problems. Therefore, UAVs can utilize their limited computational capability to perform wind forecasting. In this way, UAVs form edge intelligence in offshore wind farm. With the forecasted wind conditions, we design two algorithms to solve the formulated problems, and then evaluate the proposed methods with realworld data. The results reveal that the proposed methods offer an improvement of 44% of the power generation from the turbine compared to hour-ahead forecasting and 25% reduction of the flight time of the UAVs compared to the chosen baseline method.",,,,,IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) on Advanced Technology for 5G PlusIEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) on Advanced Technology for 5G Plus,"DEC 07-11, 2020DEC 07-11, 2020",IEEE; IEEE Commun Soc; Chunghwa Telecom; Foxconn; Huawei; Mediatek; 6G Off; Askey; Ericsson; FET Qualcomm; Taiwan Mobile; Auden Techno Corp; Keysight Technologies; Telecom Technol Ctr; NIIEEE; IEEE Commun Soc; Chunghwa Telecom; Foxconn; Huawei; Mediatek; 6G Off; Askey; Ericsson; FET Qualcomm; Taiwan Mobile; Auden Techno Corp; Keysight Technologies; Telecom Technol Ctr; NI,ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,2334-0983,2576-6813,978-1-7281-8298-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ Oslo, Dept Informat, N-0373 Oslo, NorwaySimula Metropolitan Ctr Digital Engn, N-0167 Oslo, NorwayGeorg August Univ Gottingen, Inst Comp Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",Simula Metropolitan Ctr Digital Engn,,,2021-10-24,WOS:000668970501060,,

Of 72 swans or geese reported as collision victims at 46 wind farms, most (39 birds) were reported at: 23 wind farms in Germany where such data are collated. Post-construction monitoring was undertaken for <= 1 year at 67% of 33 sites, making it difficult to test for cumulative effects or annual variation in collision rates. Site use by the birds was measured at only nine of 46 wind farms where collisions by swans and geese were monitored or recorded. Displacement distances of feeding birds at wintering sites ranged from 100-600 m, but preliminary evidence suggested that large-scale displacement also occurs, with fewer swans and geese returning to areas after wind farms were installed. Eight studies of flight behaviour all reported changes in flight-lines for swans or geese initially seen heading towards the turbines, at distances ranging from a few hundred metres to 5 km; 50-100% of individuals/groups avoided entering the area between turbines, but in some cases the sample sizes were small. Key knowledge gaps remain, including whether wind farm installation has a consistently negative effect on the number of birds returning to a wintering area; whether flight avoidance behaviour varies with weather conditions, wind farm size, habituation and the alignment of the turbines; provision of robust avoidance rate measures; and the extent to which serial wind farm development has a cumulative impact on specific swan and goose populations. It is therefore recommended that: 1) post-construction monitoring and dissemination of results be undertaken routinely; 2) the extent to which wind farms cause larger-scale displacement of birds from traditional wintering areas be assessed more rigorously, 3) further detailed studies of flight-lines in the vicinity of wind farms should be undertaken, both during migration and for birds commuting between feeding areas and the roost, to provide a more rigorous assessment of collision and avoidance rates for inclusion in collision risk models, and 4) the combination of collision mortality and habitat loss at all wind farms in the species' range be analysed in determining whether they have a significant effect on the population.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,15,1,20,,,0954-6324,2052-6458,,,,,,,,,,"Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, Burscough L40 0TA, Lancs, UK",,,,2013-01-18,BCI:BCI201300124134,,

Some general information for about political structure and the lack of support mechanism of Turkey are given. For that purpose, a comparison between some developed countries and Turkey is included in this article. Turkey is a country which has wind energy potential on land and sea more than many European countries but the value of installed wind power plants is less than these countries. There is no power generation from offshore wind turbines in Turkey whereas it is surrounded on three sides by seas. The 2023 target which is about the renewable energy generation of Turkey is the 30%. Many developed countries identify long-term plans and implement the policies depend on these plans to exploit wind energy potential more efficiently. In this study, literature screening is adopted. According to findings obtained from the comparison between developed countries and Turkey, it is concluded that although Turkey has a higher potential then a lot of developed countries regarding wind energy, expected efficiency cannot be obtained due to the lack of a national renewable energy policy and the fact that wind energy is not promoted by incentives. Energy planning and management are necessary to promote wind energy which has a vital importance for the development and future of Turkey. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

First, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Final analysis (FNL) (1 degrees x1 degrees grid resolution) and the Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) (0.05 degrees x0.05 degrees grid resolution) datasets were compared with in situ measurements. The results show a decrease in accuracy of these datasets toward the coast from the open ocean. Aiming at an improved accuracy of SST data, we developed a new high-resolution SST dataset (0.02 degrees x0.02 degrees grid resolution). The new dataset referred to as MOSST is based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product, provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). MOSST was confirmed to be more accurate than FNL and OSTIA for the coastal waters. Then, WRF simulations were carried out for 1year with a 2km grid resolution and by using the FNL, OSTIA and MOSST datasets. The use of the OSTIA dataset for a WRF simulation was found to improve the accuracy when compared with the FNL dataset, and further improvement was obtained when the MOSST dataset was applied. The sensitivity of wind speed and wind energy density to SST is also discussed. We conclude that the use of an accurate SST is a key factor not only for realistic offshore wind simulations near the surface but also for accurate wind resource assessments at the hub height of wind turbines.

Temporal scour depths and profiles at various turbine radius and tip clearances were studied by using the experimental measurements. Experiments were carried out in a purpose-built recirculating water flume associated with 3D printed turbines. The scour hole was developed rapidly in the initial process and grew gradually. The ultimate equilibrium of scour hole was reached after 180 min. The scour speed increased with the existence of a rotating turbine on top of the monopile. The findings suggested that monopile foundation and the rotating turbine are two significant considerations for the temporal evolution of scour. The scour depth is inversely correlated to the tip-bed clearance between the turbine and seabed. Empirical equations were proposed to predict the temporal scour depth around turbine. These equations were in good agreement with the experimental data.,,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,,2073-4441,,,,,,,,,,"Tianjin Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul Engn Simulat & Safety, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R ChinaFirst R&D Serv, A-08-16 M Suites,283 Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur 50450, MalaysiaUniv Malaysia Terengganu, Sch Ocean Engn, Eastern Corridor Renewable Energy Grp ECRE, Pyrolysis Technol Res Grp, Kuala Nerus 21030, MalaysiaUniv Plymouth, Sch Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandQueens Univ Belfast, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Architecture, Civil & Struct Engn & Planning, David Keir Bldg,Stranmillis Rd, Belfast BT9 5AG, Antrim, North Ireland",First R&D Serv,,,2019-07-11,WOS:000472680400026,,

The wind farm consists of 32 Senvion 6XM152 turbines. The installation took place between August 2019 and May 2020. An offshore wind turbine undergoing installation is interesting from a research point of view for several reasons: Simple geometry: turbine foundation and tower are both rotationally symmetric steel tubes. Rotational symmetry also leads to (approximate) isotropical structural characteristics in the plane normal to tower and foundation. High Reynolds number flow: Assuming a tower diameter of 6 m, and average wind speeds ranging from 5 m/s to 12 m/s under installation conditions, Reynolds numbers range from 4.5 million to 10.5 million. Wave loading under full-scale conditions. Practical relevance to improving the competetivity of offshore wind. For fluid mechanics, closely monitoring offshore wind turbines under wind and wave loading thus compares to a full-scale experiment. Monitoring 32 turbines undergoing installation thus enables the measurement a broad spectrum of different states. The investigation into the data isongoing, questions and contributions are welcome. The current data release still does not include all data. The dataset will thus be updated again in the future with more data to come.First analytic results can be found here: Sander, A, Haselsteiner, AF, Barat, K, Janssen, M, Oelker, S, Ohlendorf, J, and Thoben, K.

Both wind and wave loads are stochastic and are described using statistical models. Wave loads are a function of the sea state. For a sea state, the most important parameters are significant wave heigh H_m0 and Wave peak period T_P. To a lesser extend, wave direction, zero upcrossing period and maximum wave height are also important. Different statistical models can be used to describe the sea state and the relationship between significant wave heigh H_m0 and wave peak period. Most prominent in the North Sea is the JONSWAP spectrum. Wind loads are depending on wind speed, wind direction, shear factor and turbulence intensity. Different statistical models are available to describe the wind spectrum. Wind and wave loads trigger a structural response of the turbine. The structural response depends on the loading spectrum as well as the transfer function. Furthermore, the structural response is strongly depending on the damping and elasticity of the structure. In turbines, damping is typically very low (~ 0.5 - 1.5 %). The response is dominated by the first Eigenfrequency of the turbine. As the turbine is assumed to be rotationally symmetric, the fore-aft and side-side mode are extremely close together if not indistinguishable [1]. The response has the characteristics of a narrow-band random vibration. A narrow-band random vibration is characterized by being dominated by a single, narrow frequency peak (here: first Eigenfrequency). The amplitude envelope follows a Rayleigh distribution and the phase angle is equally distributed between 0 and 2 pi. If viewed from above, the structural response describes a closed curve (orbit) which can be characterized by it shape (eccentricity), mean amplitude and direction. Mathematically speaking, this is a lissajous-figure, where the time series from one response direction is plotted as a function of the time series of the second response direction.

Turbine numbering follows the order of installation. Different data sources are organized in subfolders for each turbine dataset. Unfortunately, not every data source is available for each turbine. Data sources are roughly sorted into categories. The following table lists these categories: location / tom : data from custom build sensor boxes. Data includes acceleration, angular acceleration, magnetic field, gnss recording and rough estimates of the eulerian angles. waves / wmb-sued :Sea state statistics for the installatin period of the turbine. waves / fino :Sea state statistics from the german research platform FINO1located approx. 6 km from the installation site. waves / waveradar :Sea state statstics, recorded by a wave rider wave laser. wind / lidar :high fidelity wind data recorded on the installation vessel during the installation of the wind farm. wind / scada :10 min. mean wind statistisc recorded on wind turbines in the vicinity of the installation site.

These recordings are sorted into this sub-subfolder. wind / fino :Additonal wind statistics recorded by the FINO research station. Least recommended for investigations, as these recordings were taken approx. 6 km from the installation site.

These Sensor Boxes were initially designed to measure accelerations and GPS tracks of offshore wind turbine towers undergoing installation. During the installation of the wind farm Trianel Windpark Borkum II they were subsequentially used to track the complete installation with a focus on single blade installation Data from the TOM devices comes as CSV files. The firmware of the boxes was designed, such that data was written into 10 MB sized txt files instead of one large txt file in order to circumvent data corruption due to power loss. However, this leads to a few milliseconds of missing data between log files. Additionally, jitter due to IO-Operations is present in the data as well and data should under all circumstance be resampled befor further analysis. Parameters provided by the TOM devices are listed in the following: epoch :machine readable time stamp based on the unix epoch in UTC [s] runtime : time since last boot of the tom device [ms] latitude : Degrees latitude in decimal writing.

The wave rider buoy was located at 54 00' 238'' degree North and 6 26' 553'' degree East. In decimals: 54.0031096 North, 6.4425532 East.Based on the raw data, sea state statistics were derived with a return period of 30 minutes. The data comes as csv, column oriented text files. The first line entails parameter names and units and is commented out by a hashbang (unix commentary). The data is a combination of two different data files as provided by the buoy: \*.HIS Data Text File (History of Spectrum parameters) and \*.HIW Data Text File (History of Wave Statistics). This results in the two timestamps in the data file because history of wave statistics data is available immediately after each measurement time period, whereas history of spectrum parameters take approx. 5 minutes to calculate by the buoy and thus have a slightly later time stamp. For actual postprocessing purposes, a third timestamp rounded to full half hour is used. Parameters included in the data files are: epoch: number of seconds since 1st of January 1970 in UTC.

U.S. onshore and offshore wind targets have been particularly aggressive. Some wind energy technologies, such as direct-drive wind turbines, rely on a volatile and Chinese-concentrated rare earth element (REE) supply chain. Global efforts have been made to develop new sources of REEs, with limited success. This lack of rare earth availability has been suggested to inhibit direct-drive adoption, despite its energy efficiency benefits. However, it is unclear if new U.S. REE supply could adequately support onshore and offshore direct-drive wind energy growth, and help meet U.S. wind energy targets. This analysis estimates U.S. and Chinese REE availability that could support U.S. direct-drive and other REE demand. Results indicated that U.S. wind installation targets with solely direct-drive designs could only require 4-12% of maximum light rare earth production from Mountain Pass, Bear Lodge and phosphate rock mines. When considering market dynamics and hypothetical U.S. production, U.S. light REE production capacity was not able to provide sufficient light rare earths to achieve wind energy targets. U.S. wind energy targets could be achieved by prioritizing 3-17% of U.S. light REE production for direct-drive wind energy.",,,,,,,,,45,5,0,0,10,0,52,,,0301-4215,1873-6777,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-02-05,WOS:000423009500028,,

The nylon fiber is treated with a new proprietary coating which has excellent wet yarn abrasion properties. The parallel-subrope type rope construction further reduces internal abrasion.Extensive laboratory testing was carried out on this new nylon rope design. Cyclic tension fatigue tests were conducted at mean loads and load amplitudes typical of actual service conditions and at higher mean loads and amplitudes. These tests demonstrate that the special nylon rope has essentially the same, desirable stretch characteristics as conventional nylon rope and has much better endurance performance.The mooring connection to the floating MEC device consists of a high-modulus fiber rope pendant which passes through a low-friction bell-mouth nylon fairlead on the MEC device. This eliminates the use of heavy, unreliable chain in this critical connection.A unique bag anchor system would be used on sand, clay, rock and other sea beds in which conventional drag embedment anchors and driven piles are impractical. The bag anchor consists of a large abrasion resistant carcass with lifting straps and top closure. The bag is transported to site in a collapsed form and is filled with local sand or aggregate to provide ballast weight. Several or many such bags are enclosed within a fiber rope net for deployment and are grouped together for connection to the mooring line.The paper will be of particular interest to designers of moorings for MEC systems in shallow water and severe wave environments.

The key load of marine structures in the sub-Arctic environment is ice load. The critical factor that should be considered in the design of ice resistant marine structures is the extreme static ice force, which should be considered to ensure the structure has sufficient static strength and stiffness to prevent being pushed over by ice. With years of research and monitoring data on some prototype flexible vertical structures, we find that simultaneous destruction is more prone to occur on these structures, and the maximum static ice force is much larger than the force value by the formula of Low Ice Force. To verify the rationality of designing flexible vertical structures in cold regions, in this paper, different extreme static ice force formulae from some building codes and research studies are analyzed, and some actual examples are presented to validate the results, so that the differences among these formulae will be shown. The prototype structure monitoring data is combined with the model test results of the Bohai Sea to verify the existence of simultaneous damage on flexible vertical structures. Based on the analysis of the monitoring data, the extreme ice load model of flexible vertical structures is proposed.

Ocean sprawl removes or transforms marine habitats through the addition of artificial structures and some of the most significant impacts are occurring in sedimentary environments. Marine sediments have substantial social, ecological, and economic value, as they are rich in biodiversity, crucial to fisheries productivity, and major sites of nutrient transformation. Yet the impact of ocean sprawl on sedimentary environments has largely been ignored. Here we review current knowledge of the impacts to sedimentary ecosystems arising from artificial structures.Artificial structures alter the composition and abundance of a wide variety of sediment-dependent taxa, including microbes, invertebrates, and benthic-feeding fishes. The effects vary by structure design and configuration, as well as the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the environment in which structures are placed. The mechanisms driving effects from artificial structures include placement loss, habitat degradation, modification of sound and light conditions, hydrodynamic changes, organic enrichment and material fluxes, contamination, and altered biotic interactions. Most studies have inferred mechanism based on descriptive work, comparing biological and physical processes at various distances from structures. Further experimental studies are needed to identify the relative importance of multiple mechanisms and to demonstrate causal relationships. Additionally, past studies have focused on impacts at a relatively small scale, and independently of other development that is occurring. There is need to quantify large-scale and cumulative effects on sedimentary ecosystems as artificial structures proliferate. We highlight the importance for comprehensive monitoring using robust survey designs and outline research strategies needed to understand, value, and protect marine sedimentary ecosystems in the face of a rapidly changing environment.

The envisioned system comprises a compliant tower, tethered to the ground with an array of four pretensioned cables moored to the seabed by suction anchors. To facilitate installation, a single pinned connection is implemented at the tower base, which is founded on a circular shallow footing. Compared to conventional solutions, the studied scheme offers the necessary support without resource to massive and difficult to construct foundations. By eliminating the moment transfer at the tower foundation, its design requirements are substantially reduced. The efficacy of the proposed solution is demonstrated by investigating the performance of the NOWITECH 10 MW reference turbine installed at 50 m water depth, in the seismically active region of North-Western Adriatic. The entire soil-foundation-structure system is modelled in 3D, employing the finite element method. After confirming the acceptable performance of the guyed system against ULS and SLS conditions (even when allowing 3P mechanical vibrations to resonate with the oscillation of the turbine tower), its seismic response is evaluated. Under seismic loading, the guyed system is shown to be resilient, sustaining the seismically-induced loading with controlled displacements at the cable connection point, protecting the tower from excessive distress and undesirable inelastic deformations. The anchoring is also shown to have acceptable performance, with the maximum attained tension being much lower than the pullout capacity of the suction caisson; the seismically induced deformations are negligible. Finally, the seismic performance of the taut mooring lines is also shown to be satisfactory.

In this perspective, both the potential for combining different renewable technologies, and the impact associated to such development should be considered in the context of the existing pressures. The spatial conflicts of sea uses and the demand for sea space are in fact increasingly growing and quantitative MSP criteria may help to evaluate the sustainability of conflicting human activities in the perspective of the minimization of the overall environmental impacts.

In this paper, three metocean models are considered, with the seastate predicted using the commercial software Mike 21, and the meteorological forcing defined by three conditions. The three conditions include (1) reanalysis data within and surrounding the hurricane, (2) predictions from the empirical Holland model within the hurricane and reanalysis data surrounding the hurricane, and (3) predictions from the empirical Holland model within the hurricane and wind-free conditions surrounding the hurricane. The accuracy of the first metocean model is validated with (1) measurements of wind speed, wave height, wave period, and storm surge during 23 historical hurricanes from 1999 to 2012 and (2) a comparison to hindcast data from WaveWatch III, another numerical metocean model. The prediction performance of the second and third metocean models is then compared with that of the first to evaluate the impact of meteorological conditions on model predictions, as the third metocean model is necessary for risk analysis, where reanalysis data of meteorological conditions is not available. This study shows that the inconsistency between the modeling of meteorological conditions for risk assessment and for validation is influential for hurricanes with low maximum wind speeds, when model predictions are significantly better if the meteorological conditions surrounding the hurricane wind field are included. This study also shows that this inconsistency is effectively diminished when considering only events with high maximum wind speeds. Since high wind speeds are what is relevant to risk assessments, the third metocean model can be reasonably used to assess hurricane risk. Finally, the uncertainties, biases, and correlations of uncertainties in the model predictions for wind speed, wave height, wave period, and storm surge are quantified for the third metocean model, and a numerical example is constructed to illustrate the impact of including uncertainty on the assessment of risk to offshore infrastructure during hurricanes. The example demonstrates how uncertainty and correlation of uncertainty influence the size and shape of a 50-year environmental contour of wind speed and wave height.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,1095-4244,1099-1824,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Massachusetts, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",,,,2019-11-28,WOS:000496480600001,,

Offshore O&M is limited by strict wave height thresholds at the offshore point of operations (typically 1.5m) and with the UK set to spend £2bn per annum by 2025 on O&M for the offshore wind industry alone the prediction of viable working windows for O&M is critical. In the tidal stream MRE sector the combined forces of waves and tidal currents on underwater tidal turbines can lead to dangerously high physical and electrical loads placed on equipment and infrastructure. Poor knowledge, and thus prediction of the local variability in weather, wave and tide conditions result in conservative thresholds for MRE operations. This, in turn, reduces the time MRE devices are in operation (and therefore energy generation), increasing investor risk and harming the financial development of the MRE sector as a whole.Existing wave and current monitoring and forecasting technologies rely on expensive in-situ measurements of the marine environment (e.g., floating wave buoys and devices on the sea bed) and models driven by these measurements or other large-scale simulations. Although very precise, the project partners have identified traditional wave and current monitoring techniques to be inadequate in terms of spatial coverage, timeliness and accuracy in complicated, high-energy coastal environments. These environments have previously proven to be difficult for wave and current observation and validation due to high equipment costs and risks of failure. As such there is a paucity of reliable, large-scale measurements of waves and currents in these high-energy marine environments.Marine navigational radar ('X-band') is a mature technology for the remote sensing of the marine environment, capable of generating estimates of tidal current speed, ocean wave parameters and water depths over wide areas. However the current state-of-the-art in X-band radar oceanography has been found lacking in the high-energy, dynamic and complicated coastal environments that marine energy projects are operating. This project aims to develop a step-change in the way we process radar data to generate measurements of the marine environment, paving the way for a system that can produce the environmental information the marine industry requires. NOC has a 20 year history at the forefront of marine radar oceanography and is well-placed to deliver this much needed development.To achieve this aim an open-source wave model will be integrated with the NOC's tried-and-tested radar analysis toolbox to produce a hybrid model/observation system. This system will combine modelled and observed wave information in such a way that minimises the errors in both; effectively generating a 'most likely' wave measurement over wider area every 10-15 minutes in near-real-time. The system will be developed using radar data and validated using ground-truth data recorded at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) on Orkney; the world's largest and most successful MRE test facility. Once validated, the system will then be demonstrated in a real-world setting at the OpenHydro test platform at EMEC.This project includes researchers with expertise radar oceanography, marine observation and the numerical modelling of the marine environment. Our project partners include EMEC, the marine energy company OpenHydro and JBA consulting; a company at the cutting-edge of operational forecasting.

Ceara, in the Brazilian Northeast, has a considerable potential for the generation of environment-friendly power, due to the occurrence of strong winds on many parts of the coast and at higher elevations. Given this, the present study aimed to evaluate the socio-environmental damage caused by the installation of a wind farm on the coastal plain of the municipality of Camocim, on the western coast of the state, and to identify the consequences for the coastal environment and the traditional community of Xavier, which survives primarily on fishing, agriculture, and the extraction of natural resources. The study was based on the recognition and definition of the environmental components of the local landscapes, and the mapping of the community's territory, based on the social cartography approach. The study area is characterized by mangrove ecosystems, dune fields, interdunal lakes, fluvial-lacustrine coastal plains, and a sandy beach. The integration of these different environments underpins the traditional lifestyle of the local community, which is based primarily on the exploitation of natural resources. Given this, the community of Xavier, which is made up of 20 families, was affected directly by the installation and subsequent operation of the local wind farm (one of the largest in the Brazilian Northeast, with 50 wind turbines generating a maximum output of 104.4 MW, and approximately 135 km of transmission lines) through (1) the gratuitous occupation of a significant portion of the community's territory, (2) deforestation of fixed dunes, (3) the suppression of dunes by bulldozing, (4) burying of interdunal lakes, (5) disturbance of the margins of fluvial-lacustrine systems, (6) compaction and impermeabilization of the soil, and (7) artificial retention of mobile dunes. These findings indicate that the licensing of wind farms in the state ignores a set of socio-environmental principles. The results of this analysis indicate the need for a regional blueprint for the development of effective socio-environmental policies for the sustainable exploitation of the coastline of the Brazilian Northeast, and in particular for the definition of the sectors most appropriate for the installation of wind farms, such as the coastal plains, which have been classified as the alternative sites with the best potential, as long as effective licensing measures are implemented.",,,,,12th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)12th International Coastal Symposium (ICS),"APR 09-12, 2013APR 09-12, 2013",,"Plymouth Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Coastal Proc Res Grp, Plymouth, ENGLANDPlymouth Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Coastal Proc Res Grp, Plymouth, ENGLAND",19,0,0,0,2,1,21,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Geog, BR-60455760 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil",,,,2014-07-23,WOS:000337995500016,,

North America has significant in-stream energy resources, and hydrokinetic electric power technologies to harness those resources have the potential to make a significant contribution to U.S. electricity needs by adding as much as 120 TWh/year from rivers alone to the present hydroelectric power generation capacity. Additionally, tidal and ocean current resources in the U.S. respectively contain 438 TWh/year and 163 TWh/year of extractable power. Among their attractive features, in-stream hydrokinetic operations do not contribute to greenhouse gas emissions or other air pollution and have less visual impact than wind turbines. Since these systems do no utilize dams the way traditional hydropower systems typically do, their impact on the environment will differ, and a small but growing number of studies support conclusions regarding those impacts. Potential environmental impacts include altered water quality, altered sediment deposition, altered habitats, direct impact on biota, and navigability of waterways.

The majority of today's energy is supplied by fossil fuels. The capacity of fossil fueled facilities to produce power is not as location dependent as renewable energy sources. Many mainstream renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydrokinetic must be located where the appropriate natural resources are most abundant. Unfortunately, some of the most energy abundant sites for renewable installations (high winds, strong sea currents) are located where climactic conditions are severe and icing is prevalent. This is significant, as many renewable resources can be substantially or completely incapacitated by icing events. This is not the case for coal, natural gas, or nuclear facilities. As the global proportion of renewable energy infrastructure increases, dealing with icing issues will become more critical. In this paper, the impact of icing on current renewable energy resources is discussed. Renewable resources are categorized based on their icing conditions. Some comparison is made among these categories to explore how different icing conditions may impact potential ice mitigation schemes. It is shown that each of the atmospheric, gas turbine and submarine environments all pose icing challenges that require mostly active, energy-intensive deicing solutions. Such active solutions are those that require significant energy input to be operational and effective (e. g., heaters, shakers, etc.). Also, in the interest of optimizing renewable energy reliability and efficiency, robust and passive systems should be pursued. Passive solutions do not require additional energy input during operation to be effective (e. g., coatings, surface treatments). Such solutions will capitalize on surface-engineering and will be based on adhesion science principles.

The future commercialization in the near future may contribute to the mitigation of carbon emissions and diversify the renewable electricity generation portfolio. Because of the high costs of marine intervention, it is important to establish reliable, remote monitoring techniques. The underwater sound around MRE devices is often monitored for environmental impact assessments. This approach can also be potentially utilized to monitor the engineering health of MRE devices. This is the objective of the project AEMORE ( Acoustic Emission technology for environmental and engineering health Monitoring of Offshore Renewable Energy), jointly conducted by the Universities of Exeter and Bath, with J+S Ltd.Acoustic Emission ( AE) monitoring is already used for Structural Health Monitoring ( SHM) of land-based structures and devices such as wind turbines. AE allows faults and defects to be detected early in a device's lifetime, providing more time to plan and implement necessary maintenance and repair procedures to avoid catastrophic failure. This is highly desirable for MRE structures, which operate in energetic seas with tight weather access windows.This paper explores the remit for AE monitoring to SHM and maintenance planning for MRE devices and demonstrates that this novel application is principally feasible. A brief review of the state of the art of AE for land-based systems aids to illustrate how its techniques can be applied to underwater environments and MRE components. This literature review will inform a classification system that relates likely failure modes to their expected acoustic emissions. The results from previous underwater environmental studies are used to evaluate their potential for SHM of MRE structures. AE environmental data collected during the operation of the Fred Olsen Lifesaver wave energy converter at the Falmouth Bay Test site ( FaBTest, SW UK) is used to demonstrate this novel application.

This holds especially true for routing decisions taken when confronted with large bodies of water. Once taken, these decisions can be hardly altered or revised. In this paper, we analysed stopover and routing decisions taken by three species of thrushes, blackbirds, redwings and song thrushes, at the German North Sea coast.Methods: Birds were equipped with radio-telemetry tags at stopover sites along the coast during autumn migration and subsequently tracked by an automated receiver network covering the coastline and islands of the German Bight.Results: The thrushes resumed migration in nights with a favourable northward wind component and clear skies. About 40% of the tagged individuals have taken an offshore instead of an alongshore oriented flight route. Routing decisions were influenced by the strength of the eastward wind component with offshore oriented flights taking place primarily under weak winds or winds blowing towards the west. Thrushes that took an offshore oriented route stopped over at the coast longer than those flying alongshore. Interestingly, offshore as well as alongshore oriented flights co-occurred within single nights and under comparable weather conditions.Conclusions: Migratory flight and routing decisions of thrushes at the German North Sea coast are highly dependent on weather, in particular wind. Still, we found evidence that weather may not be the sole reason for individual routes taken. Physical condition, morphology or animal personality lend themselves as possible additional factors of influence. Enabling a more detailed understanding of thrush migration over and along the German North Sea, our data help to better judge risks that migratory birds are facing when en route conditions are altered, for example by artificial obstacles such as offshore wind turbines.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,15,0,18,,,2051-3933,,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Avian Res, Vogelwarte 21, D-26386 Wilhelmshaven, Germany",Inst Avian Res,,,2019-10-31,WOS:000494721100001,31695918,

The oil invoice accounts for nearly 22.3% income from exports. In Morocco, the use of wind energy began before 1930, through the importation of windmills from USA by the French colony, to pump water for livestock and population in the country. An estimated 1000 of these units were in use in Morocco [1].Following the rising price of oil after the first oil-price shock in the early 1970s, the days of cheap and plentiful petroleum were drawing to an end. Morocco began to promote and develop renewable energy mainly solar energy.Wind energy is the most promising alternative energy resource in Morocco because of its good geographic location (3446 km of coast, Straits of Gibraltar, Rif and Atlas Mountain at 4167 metres and the Taza corridor) which permits Morocco to have available the largest wind potential in the North Africa. At 10 m, the annual mean wind speed can reach 11m/s in the Tetouan region and 8 m/s in the Dakhla site. The Moroccan wind potential is estimated at 21,000MW.In the framework of diversification of national energy resources, various actions have been taken for the use of wind energy as a national energy resource. It is mainly about:-Diversifying the actors, both public and private,-Concluding consessional contracts between the National Office of Electricity (ONE) and private electricity producers using wind energy to satisfy theirs own needs,-Increasing the autoproduction threshold to 50MW with the aim of installing 1000MW by modifying the laws governing the electricity production.Since wind energy is economic on windy sites and the capital costs are continue to decline with the move to larger wind turbines [2,3], the Moroccan government has set a target of achieving 20% of its electricity supply from wind energy by 2020. It has started to pay attention to developing its indigenous wind energy resources and has encouraged wind technology transfer from other countries.

A first contribution of this paper is thus formulating an optimization problem to compute the optimal routes for turbine inspection satisfying the above goal. On the other hand, the limited computational capability on UAVs can be used to increase the power generation of wind turbine. Power generation from the turbines can be optimized by controlling the yaw angle of the turbines. Forecasting wind conditions such as wind speed and wind direction is crucial for solving both optimization problems. Therefore, UAVs can utilize their limited computational capability to perform wind forecasting. In this way, UAVs form edge intelligence in offshore wind farm. With the forecasted wind conditions, we design two algorithms to solve the formulated problems, and then evaluate the proposed methods with realworld data. The results reveal that the proposed methods offer an improvement of 44% of the power generation from the turbine compared to hour-ahead forecasting and 25% reduction of the flight time of the UAVs compared to the chosen baseline method.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-11-19,PPRN:22631022,,

Primary scope of the study was to evaluate whether the combination of the two methodologies could provide a more comprehensive insight into the fish communities associated with artificial structures. The findings showed that associating the Multibeam Echosounder survey with the fishing survey provided complementary information on the spatial distribution and abundance of fish in the water column surrounding the artificial structures. Both methodologies evidenced the presence of a greater abundance and biomass of fish close to the structures in respect to reference sites.

The artificial structures were located in depths between 82 and 135 m, and growth rates of juveniles and adults, and body condition of adults, were compared among structures to determine the effect of depth on potential production. All life-history stages, including recently settled juveniles, females and terminal males, of P. rubrizonatus were caught, ranging in standard length (Ls) from 16.9 to 96.5 mm. Presumed ages estimated from whole and sectioned otoliths ranged between 22 days and 5 years, and parameter +/- s.e. estimates of the von Bertalanffy growth model were L infinity = 152 +/- 34 mm, k = 0.15(+/- 0.05) and t0 = -1.15(+/- 0.15). Estimated annual growth rates were similar between shallow and deep artificial structures; however, otolith lengths and recent growth of juveniles differed among individual structures, irrespective of depth. The artificial structures therefore sustained full populations of P. rubrizonatus, from recently settled juveniles through to adults; however, confirmation of the maximum age attainable for the species is required from natural populations.

Through soil exchange in open-ended cylinder or bucket foundation the strength of the seabed should be improved so that jack-up ships can dock directly at the quay wall and lower the stilts into the foundations. Three dimensional finite element analysis using a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian method (CEL) are carried out to simulate penetration and extraction process.

Against this background, the short but complex transition from a mainly agricultural landscape into a wind energy landscape is interpreted here following Latour's (2005b) concept of a Dingpolitik (politics of things) and complementary assumptions suggested by the European Landscape Convention.

The common explanation invokes the presence of unsteady aerodynamics due to the continuously varying incidence of the flow on the turbine blades. This phenomenon is neither new nor unique to Wells turbines, as an aerodynamic hysteresis is present in rapidly oscillating airfoils and wings, as well as in different types of turbomachinery, such as wind turbines and helicopter rotors, which share significant similarities with a Wells turbine. An important difference is the non-dimensional frequency: the hysteresis appears in oscillating airfoils only at frequencies orders of magnitude larger than the ones Wells turbines operate at. This work contains a re-examination of the phenomenon, using both computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and a lumped parameter model, and shows how the aerodynamic hysteresis in Wells turbines is negligible and how the often measured differences in performance between acceleration and deceleration are caused by the capacitive behavior of the OWC system.

The global demand for seafood is continuing to rise sharply, driven by both population growth and increased per capita consumption, whilst wild-capture fisheries are constrained in their potential to produce more seafood. A recently funded EC project, the Blue Growth Farm BGF (GA n. 774426, 1 June 2018 - 30th September 2021) aims at contributing to this world need with an original solution. The Blue Growth Farm proposes an efficient, cost-competitive and environmentally friendly multi -purpose offshore farm concept. It is based on a modular floating structure, moored to the seabed, meeting requirements of efficiency, cost-competitiveness and environmental friendless, where automated aquaculture and renewable energy production systems are integrated and engineered for profitable applications in the open sea. In the present paper, the overall engineering approach developed to carry out the research work is presented, described and justified. Different technical and scientific challenges are addressed through an integrated industrial engineering design approach, where all disciplines are tuned to achieve the Blue Growth Farm main targets. These are represented by: i) guaranteeing expected nominal fish production thanks to advanced automation and remote control capabilities; ii) minimizing the pollution introduced at marine ecosystem level when exploiting the marine natural resources, whilst increasing the social acceptance and users community agreement; iii) maximizing the electricity production in the Blue Growth Farm potential installation area ecosystem to provide energy supply to the on-board electrical equipment and to dispatch the extra produced electric energy to the land network. Preliminary engineering design results are promising to demonstrate effective increase of safety and efficiency by reducing on-board human effort and consequently risks at offshore, thus to make commercial-scale open ocean farming a reality.The present paper introduces overall concepts and design methodology whilst other companion works submitted at OMAE2019 [4], [5], [6] provide insight of specific aspects of the Blue Growth Farm project elaborated during the first six months activity.",,,,,"38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)","JUN 09-14, 2019JUN 09-14, 2019","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine EngnASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn","Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLANDUniv Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLAND",8,0,0,0,1,0,8,,,2153-4772,,978-0-7918-5883-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-03,WOS:000513102300023,,

The lengthy environmental compliance process, estimated to incur a 7-10 year permitting timeline [1], has been identified as a significant impediment to offshore energy development in U.S. waters. During operation, seabirds can collide and be displaced by turbines. During episodic pre-operation phases, cetaceans are most heavily impacted acoustically by pile driving (and similarly seismic air gun surveys for oil and gas exploration). The varying nature of impacts in space and time leads us to conclude that sites should be selected in space to minimize long-term operational impacts on seabirds, and timing of surveying and construction activities to be conducted in times of the year when sensitive migratory marine mammals are least present. We developed a novel spatiotemporal decision support framework that interactively visualizes tradeoffs between OWED industry profits and wildlife sensitivities, in both space and time. The framework highlights sites on a map that are the most profitable and least sensitive to seabirds. Within the U.S. Mid-Atlantic study area, the New York Call Areas are particularly well optimized for minimal impact on seabirds with maximal profits to OWED. For a given site, pre-operational activities (e.g. pile driving and seismic air gun surveying) are advised by cetacean sensitivity across months of the year that minimize impacts on migratory cetaceans, particularly those of highest conservation concern such as the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena Glacialis). For instance, within optimal sites for the New York Call Area the least impacting months are May and June. Other taxa are certainly affected by OWED and should be incorporated into this framework, but data on their distributions and/or sensitivities is currently less well known. Built with open-source software made publicly available, the authors hope this framework will be extended even more comprehensively into the future as our knowledge on species distributions and OWED sensitivities expands for streamlining environmental compliance.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,9,0,17,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"EcoQuants LLC, Santa Barbara, CA 93103 USADuke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Marine Geospatial Ecol Lab, Durham, NC 27708 USA",EcoQuants LLC,,,2019-06-04,WOS:000467843000004,31086363,

Potential applications include the study of cold water coral reef communities, ecosystems from underwater canyons, pipeline and harbor monitoring, or the inspection of wind turbine foundations. The project introduced and advanced a novel concept of an underwater robotic system composed of a number of mobile robot modules (nodes), carrying complementary sensors for perception of the environment. Instead of being physically coupled, the modules are connected via communication links that allow a flow of essential information among them. Without rigid links, the so-called MORPH Supra-Vehicle can reconfigure itself and adapt according to the environment and mission goals, responding, for example, to the shape of the terrain, including vertical walls. The flexibility allows for more optimal positioning of each sensor, increased number of simultaneous viewpoints, and generally high-resolution data collection.MORPH is aimed at providing a proof-of-concept demonstration of such capabilities, an effort that includes technological developments in many of the subfields of underwater technology.

This paper discusses the application of various alternative energy sources to assist powering the Goodwyn Alpha (A) Platform, located on the North West Shelf (NWS) of Australia. The three alternative energy sources under discussion are: wind, wave and solar. The extraction devices used are the Horizontal and Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines - or wind; Pelamis, PowerBuoy and Wave Dragon - for wave; and the solar parabolic dish of SunBeam and Photovoltaic (PV) cells of SunPower -for solar. These types of devices are installed within the same offshore platform area. Technical, environmental and economic aspects are taken into consideration before the best selection is made.

Considering the existing levels of anthropogenic pressures on coastal fish populations it is becoming increasingly important for developers and environmental regulators to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing fish assemblages. Improving our ability to assess such fish populations in close proximity to structures will assist in increasing this knowledge. In the present study we provide the first trial use of Baited Remote Underwater Stereo-Video systems (stereo BRUVs) for the quantification of motile fauna in close proximity to offshore wind turbines. The study was conducted in the Irish Sea and finds the technique to be a viable means of assessing the motile fauna of such environments. The present study found a mixture of species including bottom dwellers, motile crustaceans and large predatory fish. The majority of taxa observed were found to be immature individuals with few adult individuals recorded. The most abundant species were the angular crab (Goneplax rhomboides) and the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). Of note in this study was the generally low abundance and diversity of taxa recorded across all samples, we hypothesise that this reflects the generally poor state of the local fauna of the Irish Sea. The faunal assemblages sampled in close proximity to turbines were observed to alter with increasing distance from the structure, species more characteristic of hard bottom environments were in abundance at the turbines (e.g. Homarus gammarus, Cancer pagarus, Scyliorhinus spp.) and those further away more characteristic of soft bottoms (e.g. Norwegian Lobster). This study highlights the need for the environmental impacts of offshore renewables on motile fauna to be assessed using targeted and appropriate tools. Stereo BRUVs provide one of those tools, but like the majority of methods for sampling marine biota, they have limitations. We conclude our paper by providing a discussion of the benefits and limitations of using this BRUV technique for assessing fauna within areas close to offshore windfarms.

The LES model captures current driving due to winds, waves, and tides, thereby providing a high degree of physical realism. Inflow and boundary conditions are designed to represent conditions during an observational campaign at Admiralty Head in Puget Sound, and comparisons are made between the LES results and available observational measurements. Further statistical measures of the LES flow fields are outlined, including vertical profiles of Reynolds stresses, turbine loading, and two point correlations.

Anthropogenic activity has long impacted the marine continental shelf down to a depth of approximately -200 m. New activities are now affecting this coastal space such as renewable energies, recreational uses and aquaculture in addition to the traditional ones of navigation or fishing. This evolution raises new sources of conflict amongst users which can require state involvement in order to manage the different stakeholders and pressure groups. However, the coastal space still offers a large potential for development for two reasons. Firstly, the physical three dimensional potential of this space enables the whole water column to be used, principally to increase the fishing productivity as in Japan. Secondly, innovative synergies can be created between socio-technical and ecological uses (a fourth dimension) such as the eco-design of wind turbine foundations in order to create fish habitat or sea grass settlement. This new vision in 4D for the design and the management of coastal infrastructure can potentially reduce the risk of conflict as different uses of the coastal space would not necessarily exclude one another. Indeed, several forms of synergy could be developed such as fisheries with aquaculture or biological sustainability with social acceptability. Until now, limited attempts at such an approach have been done. We suggest this is likely due to the absence of a common eco-engineering vision and the lack of experience amongst biologists and engineers in the co-construction of projects. This eco-engineering, or green vision, also takes into account the complexity and resilience of the ecosystem in the long term, if underwater engineered infrastructures are also eco-designed to increase ecological gain This new conception, for development within the coastal area, provides for an increased bio-oriented complexity to engineered structure and therefore a better resistance of the ecosystem in the long term to anthropogenic pressures and a reduction in multi-user conflicts.",,,,,,,,,39,2,0,0,18,0,42,,,0990-7440,1765-2952,,,,,,,,,,"IFREMER, DS, F-34203 Sete, FranceEgis Eau, F-34965 Montpellier 2, FranceUniv Montpellier 3, UMR CEFE 5175, Dep Biol Ecol Environm, F-34199 Montpellier 5, France",,,,2011-04-01,WOS:000293593900005,,

To illustrate the potential of such an optimization, results are presented for a case study with a specific floating foundation concept [1].The optimization study performed aims to define the least expensive configuration satisfying mechanical constraints under extreme environmental conditions. The parameters to be optimized are the total length, the armoring, the stiffener geometry and the buoyancy modules. The insulated electrical conductors and overall sheath are not concerned by this optimization. The simulations are carried out using DeepLines(TM), a Finite Element software dedicated to simulate offshore floating structures in their marine environment. The optimization problem is solved using an IFPEN in-house tool, which integrates a state of the art derivative-free trust region optimization method extended to nonlinear constrained problems. The latter functionality is essential for this type of optimization problem where nonlinear constraints are introduced such as maximum tension, no compression, maximum curvature and elongation, and the aerohydrodynamic simulation solver does not provide any gradient information.The optimization tool is able to find various local feasible extrema thanks to a multi-start approach, which leads to several solutions of the cable configuration. The sensitivity to the choice of the initial point is demonstrated, illustrating the complexity of the feasible domain and the resulting difficulty in finding the global optimum configuration.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5778-6,,,,,,,,,"IFP Energies Nouvelles, Rond Point Echangeur Solaize, BP 3, F-69360 Solaize, FranceIFP Energies Nouvelles, 1&4 Ave Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France",,,,2017-12-22,WOS:000417228200072,,

A 267-turbine wind farm was constructed within the core wintering area of the redhead on a private ranch along the western coast of the Laguna Madre, in 2010. Our objective was to investigate the effects of this wind farm on the habitat and potential displacement of redheads and their use of coastal ponds along the lower Texas coast. We conducted weekly aerial surveys to monitor coastal pond use by wintering redheads from mid-October through mid-March during pre-construction (2000-2003) and post-construction (2012-2014) of the wind farm. Pond availability and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) within the wind farm were significantly correlated during pre-construction (n=16, R-2=0.53, P=0.035) and post-construction (n=11, R-2=0.64, P=0.003). However, the number of ponds available at each PDSI level within the wind farm decreased during post-construction (paired t=3.2, n=5, P=0.033). The average number of redheads detected per survey on coastal ponds within the wind farm decreased by 77% from pre-construction to post-construction. Redhead abundance on ponds across the entire Laguna Madre increased by an average of 3.26 times between pre-construction and post-construction, partly due to increases in the continental redhead population. It appears that the wind farm has altered the use of coastal ponds by redheads during winter.

The variation in these life cycle energy intensity studies, after normalizing for capacity factor and life span, is significantly affected by OWF location because of geographical properties, namely, wind speed and water depth. To improve OWF siting, this study investigates how an OWF's distance from shore and geographical location impacts its environmental benefit. A process-based life cycle assessment is conducted to compare 20 OWF siting scenarios in Michigan's Great Lakes for their cumulative fossil energy demand, global warming potential, and acidification potential. Each scenario (four lake locations at five offshore distances) has unique foundation, transmission, installation, and operational requirements based on site characteristics. The results demonstrate that the cumulative environmental burden from an OWF is most significantly affected by (1) water depth, (2) distance from shore, and (3) distance to power grid, in descending order of importance, if all other site-relevant variables are held constant. The results also show that when OWFs are sited further offshore, the benefit of increased wind energy generation does not necessarily outweigh the increase in negative environmental impacts. This suggests that siting OWF nearer to shore may result in a better life cycle environmental performance. Finally, we demonstrate how much an OWF's environmental burdens can be reduced if the OWF system is either recycled, transported a shorter distance, or manufactured in a region with a high degree of renewable energy on the grid.",,,,,,,,,22,1,0,0,2,0,25,,,1088-1980,1530-9290,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USANatl Quemoy Univ, Dept Business Adm, Kinmen, TaiwanArgonne Natl Lab, Chicago, IL USAGTM Res, Boston, MA USADTE Energy Elect Co, Ann Arbor, MI USAUniv Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Sustainable Syst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USAUniv Michigan, Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USAUniv Michigan, Ctr Sustainable Syst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Natl Quemoy UnivGTM ResDTE Energy Elect Co,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000393120300011,,

In this context, the design of a novel fuzzy gain scheduled proportional integral (FGS-PI) controller is presented to improve the input airflow control.

These structures host fouling communities that are often new to offshore regions, potentially serving as stepping stones for range-expanding (non-indigenous) species and providing habitat and shelter for a variety of marine species.

Since loss of suitable habitat is a major reason for population declines, protection and restoration of these habitats is crucial. Reduction of the often high rate of nest predation is a potentially important tool in future conservation work. Here, we focus on predators' use of raised structures in the landscape when searching for prey. Hooded crows (Corvus corone cornix) use man-made structures such as stone walls and barbed wire fences when foraging on coastal pastures in SW Sweden. However, few studies have examined wader breeding success in relation to man-made structures, and the extent to which such structures are used by searching nest predators. We measured the spatial distribution and rate of predation on wader nests in relation to such structures. Crows spent more time at or near man-made structures than expected by chance, but we found no significant difference in nest predation relative to distance from man-made structures. However, wader nests were placed farther away from man-made structures than expected by chance in two out of three years. Waders thus tend to avoid breeding close to man-made structures, which therefore reduce the suitable breeding area and probably also the local wader population size. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The accuracy of age estimates was assessed by testing the annual deposition of annuli and the location of the first annulus by marginal increment analysis and daily growth increment counts, respectively. As commonly observed in other scorpaenids, annuli consisted of an alternating pattern of opaque and translucent zones. Marginal increment analysis confirmed that annuli are formed once a year, with opaque zones laid down in spring-summer and translucent zones laid down in autumn-winter. The precision of age estimates was tested by applying both the average percent error (APE) and the mean coefficient of variation (CV).

In Italy, as well as in other countries where wind energy is provided only by onshore plants, the interest in the deployment of offshore wind resources is rapidly growing, despite relatively modest average wind speeds, compared to typical wind conditions in the North Sea. Research efforts have, so far, addressed the exploration of the most promising locations, based on wind characteristics; however, more extended evidence of technical and economic feasibility is now needed to raise awareness in the decision makers and secure to this source of renewable energy a proper role in the future energy policies. Within such a context, the paper presents the first feasibility study for the development of an offshore wind farm off the coast of Rimini, in the Northern Adriatic Sea. The study is based on an anemometric campaign started at the site in 2008 to provide a statistical assessment of the wind characteristics and the related wind energy potential, and on a 10-year wave measurement record next to the area, together with a thorough analysis of the site geological and environmental characteristics. Environmental data are interpreted with a proper consideration of the extreme events distribution and relevant results are used to select the most appropriate commercially available wind turbine and to design the site-specific support structure. A comprehensive evaluation of the investment costs and revenues is then carried out with reference to two wind farm layouts (a first smaller, constituted of 15 elements, and another one, featuring up to 60 elements) and in relation to two different scenarios, conservative and comparatively more realistic. Results of the study clearly show that the Northern Adriatic Sea is potentially suitable for the development of a large wind farm and should encourage investments on more advanced experimental campaigns and related studies in order to prove the feasibility of innovative technological solutions that would substantially increase the profitability of such installation.

Up to date, numerous research projects have been carried out to assess scour processes and justify the need for scour protection systems and also to optimize their design. This paper describes the results of an analytical assessment aimed at characterizing, for the first time, the influence of inertial forces on the seabed and on scour by introducing the influence of the acceleration field into the approach to the problem. For this purpose, a specific software for simulating equations in fluid mechanics has been developed. This innovative approach can be used to increase the accuracy of the expected results of the current models to predict foundation scour processes and to improve the whole decision-making process regarding the need for protection systems against scour.

This review provides a commentary on our current understanding of the ecological influence of man-made structures, the consequences of their decommissioning and recognizes that our knowledge is far from complete. It is known that a diverse and complex ecosystem of attached organisms develops on submerged structures which supports a localized food web that could not exist without them. However, our lack of detailed information makes modelling of system response to decommissioning very tentative. Ideally, we should use the best possible scientific information to reach a consensus as to whether the blanket removal of MMS (excepting derogations) is the most environmentally supportable option. The evidence available to-date shows both benefits and some risk in leaving MMS in place and this needs to be examined without preconception. On the UKCS, MMS as artificial habitats are not considered under the Habitats Directive, irrespective of the value or rarity of the species present. We conclude that a more comprehensive regulatory process, together with the recognition of the ecology associated with manmade structures, would allow science to play a role in the decision-making rather than supporting a blanket policy ignoring ecological context.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,8,0,20,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sch Biol, Sediment Ecol Res Grp, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland",,,,2020-09-08,WOS:000562460200021,,

Due to cyclic loads arising from wind and wave actions the fatigue performance of the connection has to be considered. In lattice substructures like jackets the grouted connections are located at seabed level being fully submerged during their entire lifetime. Today's fatigue design regulations are based on investigations neglecting any influence of the surrounding water since they were conducted in dry ambient conditions. So far, only Germanischer Lloyd gives additional recommendations for submerged grouted connections.At the Institute for Steel Construction, Leibniz Universitat Hannover, Germany investigations of the joint research project 'GROWup' focus on the fatigue performance of axially loaded grouted connections. The project is funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi, funding sign: 0325290) and is the third project in a row dealing with grouted connections. As part of this research project, cyclic loading tests on small-scale and large-scale grouted connections with shear keys are conducted. Small-scale fatigue tests showed a reduced number of endurable load cycles for connections when tested in wet ambient conditions.However, the transferability of these findings to a larger scale was still doubtful due to unknown scale effects. Therefore, the impact of water on the fatigue performance was tested recently at large-scale grouted connections. Previous to the submerged large-scale grouted connection fatigue tests, similar test specimens were exposed to alternating loads at dry ambient conditions. Comparison of both large-scale test results under wet and dry conditions enable to estimate the influence of water on the fatigue performance of grouted connections. Reflection of the small-scale test results gives hints on the scale effect.

It has notable advantages in abundant wind resources, good engineering geological conditions, and powerful capacity for a regional power grid, convenient ports and inland water transport, and low probability of meteorological disaster. The offshore Three Green Gorges, which supply the Yangtze River Delta with green energy and power for its sustainable development, comprise an extended wind power industry system as follows: wind power generation, wind turbine research, development and manufacturing, non-coal, high-energy-consumption wind power industries, including the salt chemical industry, metallurgical industry, intensive processing industry of metals and non-metallic materials, and leisure tourism of offshore wind power. Their installed capacity of wind power will theoretically reach 60 million kW in the short term and 120 million kW in the long term. Their wind power generation will add up to 142 billion kWh per year in the short term and 284 billion kWh per year in the long term, 1.7 times and 3.4 times that of the Three Gorges hydropower project respectively. In addition, the wind power generation in the short term will reduce the usage of 53.96 million tons of standard coal, 12 thousand acres of land, 7.1 million tons of fine dust, 142 million tons of carbonic acid gas, 0.71 million tons of nitrogen oxide and 1.136 million tons of sulfur dioxides each year. In the last of this paper, some proposals have been put forward for achievement of the construction goals and spatial layout project. Firstly, more attention should be paid to the wind resources evaluation in the radial sandbank area and to the integration with the extended wind power industries in the Yangtze River Delta. Second, the offshore wind power mainly adopts an on-grid pattern, supplemented by an off-grid pattern.

To further improve the prediction of scour around those structures, systematic laboratory tests were conducted in a closed-circuit flume on the processes and time development of scour around a monopile in tidal flow. The tidal currents were adapted by bidirectionally reversing currents with continuously changing flow velocity. Therewith, multidirectional flow aspects were simplified into flow components in tidal main direction. Tidal cycles and flow intensities were scaled with regard to field measurements at the FINO 1 platform in the North Sea. The model tests were conducted at a length scale of 1:40 and scour depths were measured at multiple positions around the monopile by a camera system. Novel insights on the intrinsic progression of sediment displacement and time scale of the scour process were gained and in the following presented as a function of flow intensity for clear-water and live-bed conditions. In addition, baseline tests with unidirectional currents were conducted, in which the constant flow velocity was either based on the maximum peak or the root mean square velocity of the tidal currents. Significantly slower scour progression and smaller scour depths in tidal currents were found, compared to unidirectional currents based on the maximum peak velocity. In contrast, scour depths in tidal currents exceed those for unidirectional currents by up to 51%, if the unidirectional currents are based on the root mean square value. The comparison further implies that a flow velocity of around 15-20% larger than the root mean square flow velocity of the tide is needed to accurately estimate tidal current induced scour depth by unidirectional current. Thereby, the results underline the importance of selecting suitable conditions for the design process of offshore structures. For design purposes, the evolution of tidally induced scour could be well predicted with a time discretised stepping approach.",,,,,,,,,32,8,0,0,1,0,37,,,0378-3839,1872-7379,,,,,,,,,,"Lelbniz Univ, Ludwig Franzius Inst Hydraul Estuarine & Coastal, Nienburger Str 4, D-30167 Hannover, GermanyTech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Leichtweiss Inst Hydraul Engn & Water Resources, Beethovenstr 51a, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany",,,,2018-07-23,WOS:000438006000006,,

Marine renewable energy devices (MREDs) interact with their receiving environment and are de-facto artificial reefs. The Loch Linnhe Artificial Reef (LLR) complex is a large-scale experimental facility, with the main matrix consisting of 30 separate reef modules deployed in 10-30 m depth and over a gradient of hydrographic and sedimentological conditions. The LLR offers potential to examine impacts that are analogous to those likely to occur around MREDs. The extent of the impact of the LLR modules on the receiving environment was assessed by determining their effect on sedimentary redox potential, as a function of distance from the reef-edge, and season, using an innovative, hand-held, underwater redox probe. The results are commensurate with the reef-proximal baffling of water flow resulting in the entrapment of drifting phytodetritus. At the least current-exposed reef-group the expected decrease in mean redox, at 80 mm sediment depth, was 80 mV (95% Cl 40, 120 mV) but this effect was not observed more than 1 m from the reef edge and only occurred during summer months (water temperature >10 degrees C). Redox at the reef edge, particularly during summer months, was more variable compared to redox taken at 1 m and 4 m reef-distance and was associated with the patchy distribution of phytodetrital accumulations. At all reef groups, there was no discernible difference in modelled mean redox between observations taken at 1 m and 4 m-reef distance. Artificial structures, including MREDs, may cause quite major sedimentary changes but this evidence suggests that these effects will be of limited spatial scale and, where phytodetrital accumulations occur, are only likely to be detrimental in oxygen-deficient sediments. Where these changes occur at well-flushed sites they are likely to be associated with increased infaunal biomass typical of moderate organic enrichment. (C) 2014 The Author.

Moreover, recently they found a new application in the mooring of floating wind turbines. The integrity of mooring systems is of great importance for both industries. Failure Records [1]-[2] indicate that fatigue of mooring chains is one of the main causes of failure, and therefore their lifetime prediction represents an important challenge for industry. Chains are intended to work under Tension Loading, however, anomalous loading modes such as Out-of-Plane Bending (OPB) or Twisting can appear. For example, OPB caught the attention of engineers after the Girassol incident; where it was identified as the main cause of failure of several chain links eight months after the installation [3]. Since this failure, OPB has attracted the attention of several research programs and multiple publications can be found in the literature (For example, [4]- [5]). Twist may occur during the installation of a chain or during service due to torque generated in the nearby elements of the mooring (for example wire cables). This paper presents a computational fatigue assessment of mooring chains working in twisted conditions. It is based on a two steps analysis: a mechanical and a fatigue analysis. The mechanical analysis accounts for the initial residual stress state of the chain after manufacturing and subsequent proof loading. The result is the stabilized cycle of the multiaxial stress field, which is obtained through an elastic-plastic three-dimensional Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Then, the fatigue analysis is performed to predict the failure location and determine the lifetime.

Eventually, similar to 30,000 jobs will be lost in related industries because of platform removals. Retired oil and gas platforms could be redeployed for alternate uses such as CO2 capture and storage, renewable wind energy, and sustainable fisheries and employ citizens in coastal areas. Elsewhere around the world, offshore platforms are used for purposes other than producing oil and gas. U.S. Federal legislation (Energy Policy Act 2005 Section 388 of Public Law [PL] 109-58); 30 CFR 285.1000 Subpart J) authorizes the use of retired oil and gas platforms for alternate uses. If the retired oil and gas structures are preserved, the infrastructure could also be used to recover stranded petroleum using CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR). We examined the socio-economic incentives, environmental impacts, and regulatory issues associated with the alternate uses. We suggest that CO2-EOR is the most economically efficient way to store CO2 offshore and that offshore wind turbines may assist with the energy requirements for oil and gas production and CO2-EOR. Data suggest that in our study area offshore platforms are more successful at producing fish and invertebrates if they are left standing instead of toppled over. The greatest regulatory issue facing the use of retired platforms is the transfer of liability. If the structures are redeployed, the previous oil and gas owner/operators are still responsible for eventual removal and catastrophic events.

The effects of cyclic lateral loading on the offshore piles and particularly the possibility of a progressive accumulation of residual pore water pressure within the saturated embedding soil are discussed in this article. Here it is shown that this can lead to significant changes of their behaviour under external loading, which can potentially compromise the foundation's stability or serviceability. Furthermore, some of the singular effects arising during a realistic storm of moderate magnitude as well as their potential for transient damages to the foundation's stiffness are addressed in the paper. For the investigation of these phenomena the authors have employed a coupled bi-phasic analytical model of the offshore foundation. The constitutive model employed for the seabed, in the frame of the theory of Generalized Plasticity, can reproduce some complex features of cyclic soil behaviour such as the tendency for a progressive densification under cyclic loading, which is responsible for the soil liquefaction phenomena in undrained conditions.

Indeed, marine energy resources are said to have the potential to supply up to 20 per cent of the nation's electricity demand. However, these technologies are currently at the development stage and make no meaningful contribution to the national grid. A number of devices have been developed, but no single method has emerged as the leading technology. This paper aims to compare two promising devices, one wave device and one tidal device, and assess the life cycle properties of each. A life cycle assessment of the Oyster wave energy device was conducted as part of this study, and a comparison of this and the SeaGen marine current turbine was undertaken. In both cases a 'cradle-to-grave' assessment was carried out, calculating emissions from materials, fabrication, transport, installation, lifetime maintenance, and decommissioning (including recycling). The SeaGen tidal device was calculated to have an energy payback period of 14 months, and a CO(2) payback period of 8 months. The equivalent figures for the Oyster device were 12 and 8 months, respectively. The respective energy and carbon intensities for the two devices were 214 kJ/kWh and 15 gCO(2)/kWh for the SeaGen and 236 kJ/kWh and 25 gCO(2)/kWh for the Oyster. The calculated intensities and payback periods are close to those of established wind turbine technologies, and low relative to the 400-1000 g CO(2)/kWh of typical fossil fuel generation. With further developments in construction and deployment efficiency these intensities are expected to fall, so the devices appear to have the potential to offer a viable contribution to the UK's future energy mix.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,2,0,23,,,1475-0902,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sheffield, Sheffield E Futures Doctoral Training Ctr, Sheffield S1 3TD, S Yorkshire, England",,,,2011-11-16,WOS:000296227000002,,

Coastal landscapes are being transformed as a consequence of the increasing demand for urban infrastructure to sustain commercial, residential and tourist activities. A variety of man-made structures, such as breakwaters, jetties and seawalls have thus become ubiquitous features of intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats. This transformation will accelerate in response to the exponential growth of human populations and to global changes, such as sea-level rise and increased frequency of extreme meteorological events (e.g. storms). Here, we provide a critical overview of the major ecological effects of increasing infrastructure to marine habitats, we identify future research directions for advancing our understanding of marine urban ecosystems and we highlight how alternative management options might mitigate their impacts.2. Urban infrastructure supports different epibiota and associated assemblages and does not function as surrogate of natural rocky habitats. Its introduction in the intertidal zone or in near-shore waters can cause fragmentation and loss of natural habitats. Furthermore, the provision of novel habitat (hard substrata) along sedimentary shores can alter local and regional biodiversity by modifying natural patterns of dispersal of species, or by facilitating the establishment and spread of exotic species.3. Attempts to use ecological criteria to solve problems of urban infrastructure are promising. Incorporating natural elements of habitat (e.g. wetland vegetation; seagrass) into shoreline stabilization can reduce ecological impacts, without impinging on its efficacy in halting erosion. Likewise, improving the ecological value of artificial structures by adding features of habitat that are generally missing from such structures (e.g. rock-pools) can contribute to mitigation of the detrimental effects of urbanization on biodiversity. Management of anthropogenic disturbances (e.g. maintenance works; harvesting) to artificial habitat is, however, necessary if such attempts are to be successful.4. Synthesis and applications. Increasing our understanding of the ecological functioning of marine habitats created by urban infrastructure and incorporating ecological criteria into coastal engineering are crucial for preserving biodiversity in the face of the growth of human populations in coastal areas and of forecasted global changes. Achieving this goal will need strong collaboration between engineers, managers and ecologists.",,,,,,,,,694,9,2,0,562,6,755,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Biol, CoNISMa, I-56126 Pisa, ItalyUniv Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Marine Ecol Labs A11, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,,,2010-02-01,WOS:000274191300004,,

Surveys of waterbirds at three sites on the coast of southern Jiangsu Province, China, in 2014 and 2015 produced peak counts of international importance for 24 species, including seven globally threatened and six Near Threatened species. The area is of particular global importance for the 'Critically Endangered' Spoon-billed Sandpiper Calidris pygmaea (peak count across all three study sites: 62 in spring [2015] and 225 in autumn [2014] and 'Endangered' Spotted Greenshank Tringa guttifer (peak count across all three study sites: 210 in spring [2014] and 1,110 in autumn [2015]). The southern Jiangsu coast is therefore currently the most important migratory stopover area in the world, in both spring and autumn, for both species. Several serious and acute threats to waterbirds were recorded at these study sites. Paramount is the threat of large-scale land claim which would completely destroy intertidal mudflats of critical importance to waterbirds. Degradation of intertidal mudflat habitats through the spread of invasive Spartina, and mortality of waterbirds by entrapment in nets or deliberate poisoning are also real and present serious threats here. Collisions with, and displacement by, wind turbines and other structures, and industrial chemical pollution may represent additional potential threats.

One method for identifying the impacts of offshore wind farms (OWFs) on human welfare is through the assessment and valuation of ecosystem services. Using an ecosystem services approach, this paper reviews the impacts of OWFs on the ecosystem services delivered by marine environments. During the construction phase, supporting services such as reduced energy capture and nutrient cycling are changed due to the introduction of hard substrate and the reduction in soft sediment habitat at turbine bases. This may lead to changes in all other ecosystem services, both negative and positive. Quantifying these changes, however, is a challenge partly due to data limitations and a lack of clear understanding of the impacts of OWFs on the marine ecosystems. Scientific effort needs to quantitatively explore the impacts of OWFs on ecosystem functionality and the gathering of data that enables the assessment of changes to ecosystem services. Data needed to better quantify and value the impacts of OWFs on ecosystem services are suggested.

Many factors are involved, and among these, the extra costs incurred by the conservative design of offshore wind energy converters can be quickly addressed at the design stage by accounting for the nonlinear destructive interaction between wind and wave loads. Even when waves approach offshore wind energy converters collinearly with the wind, waves and wind do not always make the offshore wind energy converter's substructure deformed. These environmental loads can intermittently exert a force of resistance against deformation due to the nonlinear destructive interaction between wind and wave loads. Hence, the nonlinear destructive interaction between wave and wind loads deserves much more attention. Otherwise, a very conservative design of offshore wind energy converters will hamper the offshore wind energy industry's development, which is already suffering from enormous initial capital expenditures. In this rationale, this study numerically simulates a 5 MW offshore wind energy converter's structural behavior subject to wind and random waves using the dynamic structural model developed to examine the nonlinear destructive interaction between wind and wave loads. Numerical results show that the randomly fluctuating water surface as the wind blows would restrict the offshore wind energy converter's substructure's deflection. Nonuniform growth of the atmospheric boundary layer due to the wavy motions at the water surface as the wind blows results in a series of hairpin vortices, which lead to the development of a large eddy out of hairpin vortices swirling in the direction opposite to the incoming wind near the atmospheric boundary layer. As a result, the vertical profile of the longitudinal wind velocity is modified; the subsequent energy loss drastically weakens the wind velocity, which consequently leads to the smaller deflection of the substructure of the offshore wind energy converter by 50% when compared with that in the case of wind with gusts over a calm sea.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,2077-1312,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Seoul, Dept Civil Engn, Seoul 02504, South Korea",,,,2021-01-12,WOS:000601941500001,,

The need to take cyclic degradation of axially loaded piles into account was postulated in the DIN 1054:2005-01 for the first time in Germany. This lead to comprehensive research activities especially due to the progress in the offshore wind industry.In the course of the scientific research the necessity for finding practical design approaches arose, which are capable to predict the behaviour under cyclic loading with sufficient accuracy, since the installation of offshore wind turbines already had started. This was the reason why the new chapter 13 and appendix D of the 2(nd) edition of the Recommendations of the Working Group 2.1 Piles of the German Geotechnical Society (EA-Pfahle, 2011) was published in advance in order to allow for the review of the engineering community.In this chapter 13 an analysis format using cyclic interaction diagrams is given. These diagrams summarise practical experience with axially cyclic loaded piles and offer the assessment of an admissible number of load cycles depending on the cyclic loading and the static pile capacity.In the paper at hand several cyclic interaction diagrams in use today are presented and their characteristics are discussed. The dominating effect on the cyclic degradation of a foundation pile for an offshore wind turbinde comes from a relatively high cyclic load ratio at a comparably low number of load cycles. This is the reason why a new modified cyclic interaction diagram is proposed, which takes into account this important effect in a realistic manner.The use of interaction diagrams in line with the EA-Pfahle (2011) is explained and illustrated by practical examples.

(2) Distance to the nearest rocky shore and age of the artificial structures were important for species richness and community composition on the artificial structures.

Mission complexity is compounded for each vehicle added to the mission. In practice, fleet operations are formulated as separate temporal problems by the operator and solved using a temporal planner. This paper proposes a planning method that uses energy as the base planning resource instead of time. Unlike temporal planners, energy planners account for physical loads endured by the vehicles. The extent of uncertainty in the vehicle loads is clarified by using the vehicle dynamics model and Monte Carlo simulation on the model parameters. The planning method is a multistage procedure to decompose operator specified task, obstacle, and vehicle data into an energy formulation of the Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) which is then solved using Discrete Strengthened PSO (DStPSO). The DStPSO algorithm has been modified to include a selective swarm size decay method that allows for larger initial swarm sizes to promote early exploration and preserves a percentage of the best performing particles on each iteration to save computational resources. The planner produces near-optimal routes containing feasible trajectories for individual vehicles that maximise tasks completed according to individual vehicle energy constraints. A case-study mission for long-term, large-scale, underwater inspection of a wind turbine array was converted into input data to evaluate the planner. Energy planning presents the opportunity for vehicles to actively monitor the feasibility of their individual plan against their current energy consumption, allowing for advanced reasoning and fault handling to occur in situ without operator assistance.

A realistic analysis of the offshore structural performance with marine deteriorations is a challenging task. The traditional probabilistic model is sometimes too biased and could lead to undesirable results since the available information regarding the corrosion process is usually quite imprecise and uncertain. In this paper, the robustness assessment of offshore structures with consideration of corrosion effect is investigated through the fuzzy concept. The fuzzy model is introduced to quantify the thickness reduction associated with the corrosion process. The uncertainty regarding the time varying effect of the ultimate strength is analyzed in the computation to reflect the structural deterioration process. The concept of entropy is used to measure the degree of uncertainties in the input and output of a structural model in the robustness assessment. In order to demonstrate this innovation, this paper selects several similar structural models and compares their performances for the same level of damage imprecision. The results are also compared to the traditional probabilistic assessment methods and the experimental models in the literature. The advantage of applying this concept is shown in the results for comparing the performances of different structural systems with various intensities of imprecision in the input parameter.

One of the goals of such environmental assessment studies is to highlight species assemblages and habitat composition that could make the targeted area unique. A section of the Oregon continental slope that had not been previously explored was targeted for the deployment of floating wind turbines. We carried out an underwater video survey, using a towed camera sled, to describe its benthic assemblages. Organisms were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible and assemblages described related to the nature of the seafloor and the depth. We highlighted six invertebrate assemblages and three fish assemblages. For the invertebrates within flat soft sediments areas we defined three different assemblages based on primarily depth: a broad mid-depth (98-315 m) assemblage dominated by red octopus, sea pens and pink shrimps; a narrower mid-depth (250-270 m) assemblage dominated by box crabs and various other invertebrates; and a deeper (310-600 m) assemblage dominated by sea urchins, sea anemones, various snails and zoroasterid sea stars. The invertebrates on mixed sediments also were divided into three different assemblages: a shallow (similar to 100 m deep) assemblage dominated by plumose sea anemones, broad mid-depth (170-370 m) assemblage dominated by sea cucumbers and various other invertebrates; and, again, a narrower mid-depth (230-270 m) assemblage, dominated by crinoids and encrusting invertebrates. For the fish, we identified a rockfish assemblage on coarse mixed sediments at 170-370 m and another fish assemblage on smaller mixed sediments within that depth range (250-370 m) dominated by thornyheads, poachers and flatfishes; and we identified a wide depth-range (98-600 m) fish assemblage on flat soft sediments dominated by flatfishes, eelpouts and thorny heads. Three of these assemblages (the two broad fish assemblages and the deep flat soft sediments invertebrate assemblage) seem to represent deeper examples of assemblages already known on the Oregon continental shelf, especially on soft sediments, while the assemblages in the pockmarks habitat (the narrower depth ranges) might be unique to the area. This diversity of assemblages in a relatively small section of the Oregon continental upper slope and shelf shows the importance of environmental assessment studies in helping limit future impacts of industrial activities on benthic communities.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,0278-4343,1873-6955,,,,,,,,,,"Oregon State Univ, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USAUS Geol Survey, Pacific Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, 2885 Mission St, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA",,,,2018-05-08,WOS:000430889600003,,

This excavation can be done through suction dredging resulting in a pit. Different slope angles of this pit can be realized using this technique. As the failure mechanisms of artificial submarine slopes using suction dredging are barely investigated, relatively small final slope angles of max. 10 degree are reached to guarantee stability. Nevertheless, small-scale experiments show that submarine slopes with overcritical slope inclinations can be stable for a while when prepared with suction dredging. Steeper inclinations would significantly reduce the disturbance of the marine fauna and the amount of sand to be removed and therefore meet both economic and ecological interests. The investigations of the failure mechanism in the submarine slope during suction dredging are carried out with a coupled Euler-Lagrange approach, namely the combination of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the Discrete Element Method (DEM). This method enables the computation of particle -particle as well as the fluid-particle interaction forces and hence their influence on the investigated submarine slope behavior. The calculations are carried out with the open source software package CFDEM coupling, which combines the discrete element code LIGGGHTS with CFD solvers based on OpenFOAM. Additionally, small scale model tests of suction dredging of sandy submarine slopes are carried out. The displacement of the soil grains is monitored with a high-speed camera. To take into account effects of contractancy and dilatancy, a loosely and a densely packed sand are investigated and the influence of the packing density on the failure mechanism is evaluated.

These results are compared against (nonlinear and nonstationary) time domain simulations of the actual docking operations. It is found that a critical event is the structural damage of the TP's bracket supports due to the potential large impact forces or velocities, and a restricting installation event (not critical) is the unsuccessful mating operation due to large horizontal motions of the TP bottom.

Broadband impulsive sounds generated by pile driving may disturb and distract marine mammals such as harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena); their concentration may be reduced, affecting the skills they need for foraging (e.g., timing and precision) or reducing their ability to catch prey and, thus, their foraging efficiency. The resulting reduction in fitness may eventually lead to population declines. Therefore, it is important to understand the effects of these anthropogenic sounds on the ability of harbor porpoises to catch fish. Two captive harbor porpoises (porpoise F05 and porpoise M06) performed a fish-catching task (i.e., retrieving dead fish from a net feeding cage) while they were exposed to low ambient noise (quiet conditions) and impulsive pile-driving playback sounds at three (porpoise M06) or four (porpoise F05) mean received single-strike sound exposure levels (SELss) between 125 and 143 dB re 1 mu Pa(2)s. The two study animals differed in their fish-catching success rate at all noise levels, including under quiet conditions: Porpoise F05 was less likely to catch fish than porpoise M06. They also responded differently to increasing SELss: Only porpoise F05 was significantly more likely to terminate trials and less likely to catch fish as SELss increased above 134 dB, but her trial failure rate remained unaffected by increasing SELss. The time taken to catch a fish did not vary with SELss but was slightly longer for porpoise F05 than for porpoise M06. Results suggest that high-amplitude pile driving sounds are likely to negatively affect foraging in some harbor porpoises by decreasing their catch success rate and increasing the termination rate of their fish-catching attempts; the severity of the effects is likely to increase with increasing pile driving SELss. However, individual differences in responses to sound, termination rates, and fish-catching success (even in ambient conditions) may complicate the quantification of the impacts of pile driving sounds on harbor porpoises.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,,,0167-5427,,,,,,,,,,,"Sea Mammal Res Co SEAMARCO, Julianalaan 46, NL-3843 CC Harderwijk, NetherlandsDotmoth, 1 Mendip Villas,Crabtree Lane, Bristol BS41 8LN, Avon, EnglandTNO Acoust & Sonar, Oude Waalsdorperweg 63, NL-2597 AK The Hague, Netherlands",Sea Mammal Res Co SEAMARCODotmothTNO Acoust & Sonar,,,2019-08-02,WOS:000475551700006,,

These activities may lead to increased REE concentrations in sediments the primary habitat of European eels. In the present work, REE bioaccumulation was evaluated by determining the concentrations in yellow and silver eel muscles sampled at three different locations in the Loire estuary and at two periods (2011/2012 and 2018/2019). The aims of this study were the understanding of the spatio-temporal influences (sampling site and sampling period) and intraspecific variations (age, sex, sexual maturation, length, weight, and parasitism) on the whole REE bioaccumulation. The mean value of the sum of REE concentrations (Sigma REES) was 2.91, 6.48 and 12.60 mu g/kg of muscle from respectively yellow eels, female silver eels and male silver eels fished in 2018/2019. The results showed that silver males accumulated more REEs than silver females and silver eels accumulate more REEs than yellow ones. Regarding the determination of spatio-temporal variations, an increase of REE concentrations for silver eel muscles between the two periods was observed, certainly related to the increase of REE uses. Finally, a trend of higher contamination of eels sampled in the downstream of Nantes was noticed for yellow eels. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The coupled horizontal and rocking vibration of a monopile embedded in a fully saturated poroelastic seabed is studied in this paper. The focus of the study is the difference between the responses with and without the vertical shear stresses on the pile. The monopile dynamic response is studied by the integral equation method, with both 3D elastodynamic theory and Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Selected numerical results for highlighting the influence of the vertical shear stresses on the dynamic contact load distributions, pile displacements, and lateral dynamic impedance functions are examined for different length to diameter (l/d) ratios as well as poroelastic materials and frequencies of excitation. These results confirm that exclusion of the vertical shear stresses will lead to potentially very conservative design for monopiles with l/d < 6 in soft soil, and monopiles with l/d < 10 in medium to stiff soils.

To obtain a better understanding of the type of contextual factors that affect employees' willingness to use mindful safety practices (MSPs) at Norwegian petroleum installations, an exploratory study was performed. The study comprised two parts: The first part constituted the original study (n = 2928), and the second part constituted the replication study (n = 7207). The two part studies were based on data obtained in questionnaire surveys performed by the Petroleum Safety Authority, Norway. The study suggested that safety management practices to promote employees' willingness to use MSPs would be most efficient if directed at the employee work groups and their local work environment, rather than at the individual employee or at employees on the installation in general. It further suggested that particular efforts might be needed to promote MSP use when employees were transferred to new work environments, and when changes were introduced into existing work environments. Based on the results, a set of concrete safety management practices aimed at promoting employees' willingness to use MSPs were suggested. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the most popular REE is Neodymium (Nd), being widely used in permanent magnets, lasers, and glass additives. Neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets is the main application of Nd since they are used in electric motors, hard disk drives, speakers and generators for wind turbines. Recent studies have already evaluated the toxic potential of different REE, but no information is available on the effects of Nd towards marine bivalves. Thus, the present study evaluated the biochemical alterations caused by Nd in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed to this element for 28 days. The results obtained clearly demonstrated that Nd was accumulated by mussels, leading to mussel's metabolic capacity increase and GLY expenditure, in an attempt to fuel up defense mechanisms. Antioxidant and biotransformation defenses were insufficient in the elimination of ROS excess, resulting from the presence of Nd and increased electron transport system activity, which caused cellular damages (measured by lipid peroxidation) and loss of redox balance (assessed by the ratio between reduced and oxidized glutathione). The results obtained clearly highlight the potential toxicity of REEs and, in particular of Nd, with impacts at cellular level, which may have consequences in mussel's survival, growth and reproduction, affecting mussel's population.

Furthermore, the first floating offshore wind farm is being built off the coast of Scotland. In order to realise the potential of MRE to achieve the targets set by the Government and keep the UK's leading position; the sector needs to address some relevant technical, environmental and interdisciplinary challenges. A coordinated response from different actors at national and regional level is required in order to successfully face these challenges. In an attempt to provide this coordination and with an initial focus on the South west of the UK, the Partnership for Research In Marine Renewable Energy (PRIMaRE) was established, bringing together research expertise and access to facilities for MRE developments.PRIMaRE comprises the Universities of Plymouth, Exeter, Southampton, Bristol and Bath, along with the Marine Biological Association and Plymouth Marine Laboratory. Completing the line-up of PRIMaRE is the South West Marine Energy Park and the Wave Hub facilities, acting as conduits between the research community and industry. More recently, PRIMaRE has extended its borders both nationally and internationally by including the Universities of Uppsala, Cardiff and Cranfield as associated partners of PRIMaRE. The core partner institutions have signed up to a partnership agreement to work together on research across the spectrum of MRE and to establish a 'network of excellence' centred in the South of the UK. PRIMaRE has established the annual conference (now in its third year) to showcase the research and provide a forum for discussion with MRE industry and academia, and have organised industry oriented workshops to identify research priorities in order to align research efforts with the requirements of the MRE sector.With the support of the EPSRC Network Grant, PRIMaRE aims to expand the partnership to a new level, making active and effective contributions to the challenges of the MRE sector. The Network brings together academic effort on MRE challenges, but also given the nascent state of the industry, aims to work closely with supply chain and industry partners, by providing training and a forum for sharing and exchange of ideas and through access to academic expertise and facilities. Unlike the academic focus of doctoral training schemes, the proposed network aspires to a broad sector approach, in which training and research collaborations are promoted both for conventional research and academic staff (i.e., post-docs, researchers, academics, PhD students) and for industry staff (developers, supply chain, test centres, regional government agencies). The proposed network has four main pillars of focus: (i) the annual PRIMaRE conference, expanded to become a key National and International event for the sector; (ii) the Key Challenge Workshops, an industry oriented dynamic and proactive forum to ensure alignment of PRIMaRE research priorities, and to focus on key emerging challenges requiring special attention; (iii) travel grants, which are crucial to ensure knowledge transfer and to promote the required mobility between academia and industry needed to develop new research collaborations nationally and internationally; and (iv) the PRIMaRE summer school, a continuing professional development (CPD) high level programme, providing the mechanism for exchange of knowledge between the research, academia, the novel MRE industry and wider sector.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/P026109/1,,,,,,,,University of Plymouth,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15350814,,

In recent decades, changes in land use and increasing population density have accelerated the delivery rates of nutrients (particularly nitrogen) from terrestrial sources to aquatic biomes. Humans now contribute more reactive nitrogen (N) to the hydro- and biospheres than all other natural N sources combined. Aquatic habitats have in turn responded with nuisance algal blooms, changes in species composition, impacts on fin and shellfish resources, and deleterious economic consequences. As streams and rivers trend closer towards nitrogen saturation, increasing amounts of nitrogen pollution are exported to the coastal margins where it promotes expanded severity and duration of hypoxic events. An understanding of the fate and transport of N through the entire aquatic continuum (e.g. streams, rivers and estuaries) is necessary for identifying zones that are particularly susceptible to N inputs, and those that act as hot spots for N removal. Knowledge of the hydrologic and chemical mechanisms controlling N reactivity provides the foundation for guiding nutrient management strategies and for enhancing the natural capacity of these environments to attenuate N loads. Measurement of denitrification, the only mechanism that represents absolute attenuation of nitrogen, has been examined across a wide range of aquatic ecotypes. However, one particular segment of the aquatic continuum, tidal freshwater rivers and streams, has generally escaped inquiry. Connecting upland streams and rivers to estuaries, we suggest that tidal freshwater streams possess unique hydrology, geomorphology, and chemical reactivity that optimize for N removal relative to any other component of the aquatic continuum. Further, we propose that enhanced N removal can be generated in non tidal systems simply by inducing a quasi-tidal hydrologic regime (i.e. by generating a rhythmic rise and fall in water level). Investigators propose to combine extensive hydro-chemical monitoring efforts in Coastal Plain streams in the Southeastern U.S. with a unique series of chemical tracer studies, and stream modeling. All work is to be conducted in situ under natural and hydrologically-manipulated conditions. Tidal streams are dominant aquatic features of the Southeastern US, and the proposed work will help to determine the extent to which they are a hotspot for N removal on broad geographic scales. The research represents a federal-academic partnership that will provide a better understanding of how nutrient loading in watersheds translates into ecosystem response along continental margins. Work of this nature is essential for improving predictions of habitat response to human perturbation and/or restoration effects, assessing resiliency of aquatic habitats, refining regulatory targets for nutrient loading. The mechanistic picture of how hydrology and chemistry interact to regulate N processing provides the critical foundation for developing simple low-cost technologies that enchance natural N attenuation and thereby improve water quality. Broader impacts of the work include extensive educational components, public outreach, and the potential for technology transfer. Research activities are integrated directly into academic curricula, investigators will mentor high school and undergraduate students, train graduate students, and provide opportunities for traditionally underrepresented groups. Technological advancements in water quality restoration resulting from this work will be disseminated to resource managers at the county, state, and federal levels. In total this effort facilitates enhanced stewardship of aquatic resources.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,814990,,,,,,,,UNITED STATES DEPT OF GEOLOGICAL SURVEY,UNITED STATES DEPT OF GEOLOGICAL SURVEY,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13689342,,

Out of the various renewable sources, solar and biomass and to a limited extend, wind and hydro-power are effectively used. This paper, discusses the effective applications of these resources. Bangladesh receives an average daily solar radiation of 4-6.5 kWh/m(2). Solar photovoltaic (PV) are gaining acceptance for providing electricity to households and small business enterprises in grid remote rural areas. Under the 'Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development (RERED) Programme' a total of 64,000 SHSs will be installed by 2007. So far, a total of 37,000 SHSs with a capacity of about 2.5 MWp have been installed in the country.The next effective source of renewable energy is biomass. Under this category improved stoves, bio-gas plant and bio-mass briquitting are note worthy. The Institute of Fuel Research and Development (IFRD) has developed a number of improved stoves. These stoves save 50-70% fuel as compared to the traditional ones. So far, more than 100,000 stoves have been installed in the users kitchens. The potential of biogas technology is immense. According to an official estimates there is a cattle population of 24 million and poultry population of 75 million. This can produce about 3 billion m 3 biogas. The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) and IFRD are working to install the biogas plants in the rural areas. So far, a total of 19,596 biogas plants have been installed. Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET) has successfully under took a research and development work on biomass briquitting technology with a grant from SIDA. By now, this technology has transferred to private entrepreneurs. Currently, about 60 small private enterprises are producing briquettes from rice husk and saw dust.Because the country is flat, hydropower is not abundant. At present, 230 MW is harnessed from the Kaptai dam. Besides, in the southeastern hilly regions a few micro-hydro sites have been identified. Very recently, one 10 kW micro-hydro plant has been installed by LGED at Bamerchara in Chittagong.Wind energy potential is not encouraging except in the coastal areas of Bangladesh.

This wind-wave hybrid platform is moored by eight catenary lines to keep its position against wind-wave-current environment. In most cases, the resonant frequency of horizontal motion of moored platform is very low, so a resonance is hardly seen by numerical simulation with linear wave assumptions. However, the incident waves with different frequency components are accompanied by sum and difference frequency loads due to the nonlinearity of the waves. Typically, the magnitude of the second-order wave loads are small and negligible, but once the second-order wave loads excite the platform at its natural frequency, the resonance can take place, which results in adverse effects on the platform. In this paper, the second-order difference frequency wave load on the wind-wave hybrid platform is numerically assessed and time domain simulation by coupled platform-mooring dynamic analysis is carried out. As a result, the horizontal motions of the platform was highly excited and the increased motions led higher top tension of the mooring lines compared with the case of linear wave environment. Especially, the combination of the wind and wave loads excited the horizontal motions more and made the mooring top tension far higher than wave load was only applied. With regards to the second-order difference frequency wave load, the result with the Quadratic Transfer Function (QTF) is compared to the one with Newman's approximation. As the simulation results between them was insignificant, the Newman's approximation can be used instead of the complete QTF to reduce the computational effort.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,978-0-7918-5774-8,,,,,,,,,"Jeju Natl Univ, Jeju Si, Jeju Specialize, South KoreaKorea Res Inst Ships & Ocean Engn, Deajeon, South Korea",,,,2017-12-21,WOS:000417225300048,,

An ETS is composed of an energy transformation device (ETD) and if necessary an energy converter that is utilized to match the electrical characteristics of the ETD to those of the electrical network; the converter facilitates the exchange of energy between the ETD and the electrical network at the required rate. An ETS may also be known as a source if it capable of supplying net positive energy to the electrical network for consumption by the loads. Energy exchange between the electrical network and the ETD may be unidirectional or bi-directional. Bi-directional energy exchange implies that the ETD has energy absorption capability. Energy absorption can manifest itself most economically with energy storage capability, alternately it may manifest itself as the ability to dissipate energy. Not all ETS that have energy storage capability may operate bi-directionally. Unidirectional ETS's include the traditional generators utilizing combustion based diesel engine, gas turbine or boiler + steam turbine prime movers as well as alternate ETS such as fuel cells and primary batteries that also have energy storage capability. Unidirectional ETS such as wind turbine generators and solar energy do not have energy storage capability as we commonly understand it. Bi-directional ETD's include secondary batteries, capacitors and flywheels.

Increasing temperatures worldwide have been blamed for numerous negative impacts on agriculture, weather, forestry, marine ecosystems, and human health. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that the primary GHG emitted in the U.S. is carbon dioxide (CO2) most of which stems from fossil fuel combustion [1]. In fact, CO2 represents approximately 85% of all GHG emissions nationwide. The other primary GHGs include nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), ozone (O-3), and fluorinated gases.Since the energy sector is responsible for a majority of the GHGs released into the atmosphere, policies that address their mitigation through the production of electricity using renewable fuels and distributed generation are of significant interest. Use of renewable fuels and clean technologies to meet energy demand instead of relying on traditional electrical grid systems is expected to result in fewer CO2 and CH4 emissions, hence reducing global climate change impacts. Technologies considered cleaner include photovoltaics, wind turbines, and combined heat and power (CHP) devices using microturbines or internal combustion engines. The Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) in California [2] provides incentives for the installation of these technologies under certain circumstances.This paper assesses the GHG emission impacts from California's SGIP during the 2005 program year by estimating the reductions in CO2 and CH4 released when SGIP projects are in operation. Our analysis focuses on these emissions since these are the two GHGs characteristic of SGIP projects. Results of this analysis show that emissions of GHGs are reduced due to the SGIP. This is because projects operating under this program reduce reliance on electricity generated by conventional power plants and - encourage the use of renewable fuels, such as captured waste heat and methane.",,,,,ASME Power Conference 2007ASME Power Conference 2007,"JUL 17-19, 2007JUL 17-19, 2007","ASME, Power DivASME, Power Div","San Antonio, TXSan Antonio, TX",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4273-7,,,,,,,,,"Itron Inc, Spokane, WA 99216 USA",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000250717400055,,

However, the ecological effects of such structures on the natural surroundings remain unclear. We investigated the impact of experimentally introduced tetrapod fields on the demersal fish community in a hard-bottom area in the southern North Sea. The results indicated a significant decrease in fish abundance in the surrounding area caused by migration effects towards the artificial structures. Diversity (HB) and evenness (E) values exhibited greater variation after the introduction of the tetrapods. Additionally, a distinct increase in young-of-the-year (YOY) fish was observed near the structures within the second year after introduction. We suggest that the availability of adequate refuges in combination with additional food resources provided by the artificial structures has a highly species-specific attraction effect. However, these findings also demonstrate that our knowledge regarding the impact of artificial structures on temperate fish communities is still too limited to truly understand the ecological processes that are initiated by the introduction of artificial structures. Long-term investigations and additional experimental in situ work worldwide will be indispensable for a full understanding of the mechanisms by which coastal defence structures interact with the coastal environment.

The loss of stratification within the wake of a single OWF structure is observed for the first time by means of field observations, which enable a qualitative characterization of the disturbed flow downstream. These results are complemented with high-resolution large eddy simulations of four different stratification strengths that allow for a quantification of turbulence and mixing quantities in the wake of a foundation structure. The turbulent wake of a structure is narrow and highly energetic within the first 100 m, with the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy well above background levels downstream of the structure. A single monopile is responsible for 7-10% additional mixing to that of the bottom mixed layer, whereby similar to 10% of the turbulent kinetic energy generated by the structure is used in mixing. Although the effect of a single turbine on stratification is relatively low, large-scale OWFs could significantly affect the vertical structure of a weakly stratified water column. Further, rough estimates show that the rate of formation of stratification in the study area is of the same order of magnitude as the additional mixing promoted by the structures, thus OWFs could modify the stratification regime and water column dynamics on a seasonal scale, depending on local conditions and farm geometries.Plain Language Summary Advances in the renewable energy sector have enabled the construction and operation of wind farms in bodies of water deep enough to present vertical temperature differences across the water column or thermal stratification. In coastal regions dominated by tidal motion, the presence of offshore wind farm (OWF) structures brings about additional turbulence and mixing of stratification. The present study combines field measurements and numerical simulations to characterize the wake of single OWF structures and quantify the amount of turbulence and mixing generated by them. Our results suggest that the effect of OWF structures is small compared to other naturally occurring mixing mechanisms, however can be comparable to the rate of stratification buildup. Stratification in certain regions of shelf seas could be impacted by OWFs if these are built over a large area.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,10,0,22,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Geesthacht, GermanyLeibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Meteorol & Climatol, Hannover, Germany",,,,2020-08-01,WOS:000577126400020,,

The cylinders were intended primarily to simulate aquatic vegetation canopies, but could equally be taken to represent other arrays of obstacles, for example forests or offshore wind turbines. The turbidity currents were generated by mixing naturally sourced, poly-disperse sediment into a reservoir of water at concentrations from 1.0 to 10.0 g l(-1), which was then released into the experimental section of the flume by removing a lock gate. For each initial sediment concentration, runs with obstacle arrays with solid plant fractions of 1.0% and 2.5%, and control cases with no obstacles, were carried out. The progress of the current along the flume was characterized by the array drag term, C(D)ax(c) (where C-D is the array drag coefficient, at the frontal area of cylinders per unit volume, and x(c) is the position of the leading edge of the current along the flume). The downward depositional flux of sediment out of the current as it proceeded was measured at 13 traps along the flume. Analysis of these deposits divided them into fine (2.2 to 6.2 mu m) and coarse (6.2 to 104 mu m) fractions. At the beginning of their development, the gravity currents proceeded in an inertia-dominated regime until C(D)ax(c) = 5. For C(D)ax(c) > 5, the current transitioned into a drag-dominated regime. For both fine and coarse sediment fractions, the rate of sediment deposition tended to decrease gradually with distance from the source in the inertial regime, remained approximately constant at the early drag-dominated regime, and then rose and peaked at the end of the drag-dominated stage. This implies that, when passing through arrays of obstacles, the turbidity currents were able to retain sufficient sediment in suspension to maintain their flow until they became significantly influenced by the drag exerted by the obstacles.",,,,,,,,,8,3,0,0,2,0,11,,,0037-0746,1365-3091,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Girona, Dept Phys, Girona 17003, SpainUniv Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England",,,,2017-06-01,WOS:000404336700010,,

In addition, environmental effects due to variations in temperature and external loading were intensively investigated and an efficient remedy was proposed using the nonparametric PCA and LAF models. Unlike many existing statistical damage detection methods, the mean of residual values eliminating the environmental effects was utilized as damage index for rational for enhancing the normality based on the central limit theorem and the normality was first checked before damage estimation using the mean of residual values. Laboratory tests for a scaled tidal current power plant structure, one of many jacket-type offshore structures, were conducted to investigate the technical feasibility of the proposed method for damage detection and localization. It was found that the PCA technique could more efficiently eliminate undesired environmental effects contained in the measurement data from FBG sensors without any additional information on the environmental changes, resulting in more damage-sensitive features under various environmental changes.

To manage this, most offshore wind turbines of today are installed and maintained using self-elevating units (SEUs). In this study, a method is presented that enables the analysis of weather window assessments for the installation and retrieval phases of a SEU. The method of analysis takes site-specific parameters, defined as soil type and water depth, into account in addition to vessel specific and environmental parameters. The inclusion of site specific parameters is the novel contribution compared to assessment methodologies used today.A simulation model is presented that incorporates a coupled non-linear time-domain analysis of vessel motion and soil-structure interaction. Soil deformation behaviour during impact is described by resistance curves based on a bearing capacity theory. A structural evaluation criterion against which impact forces are compared is used for weather window assessments. The simulation model is applied on a case study utilizing different soil types to study impact forces and the capacity of the structure for withstanding such impacts and eventually performing a weather window assessment.The results show that the jacking operation can be divided into two phases when it comes to loads on the spudcan: a phase dominated by vertical forces followed by a phase dominated by horizontal forces. It is found that including soil deformation behaviour is of paramount importance to the magnitude of the resulting impact forces and that class recommended practice does indeed produce rather large force estimates. Thus, assessments where site-specific parameters are incorporated could definitely increase the operable weather window for SEUs, and, consequently, increase the economic competitiveness of, for example, the offshore wind industry.",,,,,"34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015","Amer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivAmer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","St John's, CANADASt John's, CANADA",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,978-0-7918-5649-9,,,,,,,,,"Chalmers, Dept Shipping & Marine Technol, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden",,,,2016-09-02,WOS:000379707100096,,

This development can only be successful if further cuts in the levelized cost of energy are established. Regarding the design of the foundation structures, a particular challenge in this respect relates to the reduction of the total computational time required for the design. For both practical and commercial reasons, the decoupled modelling of offshore wind support structures finds a common application, especially during the preliminary design stage. This modelling approach aims at capturing the relevant characteristics of the different environment-structure interactions, while reducing the complexity as much as possible. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art modelling approaches of environmental interactions with offshore wind support structures. In this respect, the primary focus is on the monopile foundation, as this concept is expected to remain the prominent solution in the years to come. Current challenges in the field are identified, considering as well the engineering practice and the insights obtained from code comparison studies and experimental validations. It is concluded that the decoupled analysis provides valuable modelling perspectives, in particular for the preliminary design stage.

In this study, we monitored epibenthic colonization of different structures associated with a tidal energy test site located in a high-energy hydrodynamic environment. Using four years of image-based underwater surveys, we characterized changes through space and time in the taxonomic composition of epibenthic assemblages colonizing two kinds of artificial structures, as well as the surrounding natural habitat. Our results highlight that ecological successions followed similar trends across the two artificial habitats, but that different habitat-specific communities emerged at the end of our survey. Deployment of these artificial structures resulted in the addition of elevated and stable substrata in an environment where natural hard substrates are unstable and strongly exposed to sediment abrasion. Although epibenthic communities colonizing artificial habitats are unlikely to have reached a mature stage at the end of our survey, these supported structurally complex taxa facilitating an overall increase in local diversity. We were able to quantify how epibenthic communities can significantly vary over time in high-energy coastal environment, and our final survey suggests that the ecological succession was still in progress five years after the deployment of artificial reefs.

One way to assess the ecological functions of such structures is to test whether they function similarly to natural habitats. In marine systems, naturally occurring structured habitats, such as coral reefs and rocky reefs, support aggregations of planktivorous fish, often inducing spatial patterns in prey and predators. Whether similar spatial patterns occur around submerged artificial structures, which often have more abrupt topographies than natural habitats, remains less well understood. We tested whether consistent spatial patterns in planktivorous fish, their prey (zooplankton), and their predators (piscivorous fish) were present around artificial structures. We first documented spatial distributions of these 3 trophic groups around 15 marine artificial structures (shipwrecks) using acoustic surveys and then asked how spatial distributions of each trophic group relate to the others. We found that the center of planktivorous fish aggregations occurred an average of 39 m from habitat edges. Zooplankton prey were detected throughout nearly 25% of surveyed areas around habitats. Piscivorous fish predators concentrated closest to habitats. Further analyses revealed that these patterns sometimes related to environmental factors, such as water current magnitude and direction. Because spatial distributions of planktivorous fish, their prey, and their predators were consistent across sampled artificial structures, our findings suggest that artificial structures influence spatial patterns across adjacent trophic levels.

We consider the reality of market concentration and the extent to which pragmatic regulation could allow prices to rise above marginal cost to reduce the extent of direct subsidies and complex market designs.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that high relief artificial reefs had higher recruitment of coral reef fishes, mainly planktivores, than near-bottom low-relief artificial reefs, Indeed, recruitment was about two orders of magnitude higher to the experimental vertical installations than to the near-bottom ones. Most of the initial recruitment occurred at the upper sections of the vertical installations, which may indicate near surface movement of fish larvae as they approach the shore. Alternatively, it may result from preference by planktivorous species for areas with high water/plankton flux.

Two plasma-assisted process alternatives, a direct gas conversion to ethylene (one-step) and a stepwise gas conversion to acetylene followed by acetylene-to-ethylene hydrogenation (two-step), both previously demonstrated in the lab and modeled on a large scale, are evaluated using the SimaPro (R) software and ecoinvent database. Different scenarios regarding purge stream utilization and electricity sources are considered for both process alternatives. On the basis of LCA results, it is highly probable (confidence interval 93.5%) that the two-step process results in a lower carbon footprint than the one-step process. The two-step process, powered by electricity generated by wind turbines and utilizing the purge stream as the byproduct (instead of flaring it), produces the lowest carbon footprint among all studied scenarios. When natural gas is utilized as the feedstock, the two-step plasma-assisted ethylene production process is more environmentally sustainable than other peer processes (i.e. thermally driven and bio-based). When shale gas is used, greenhouse gas emissions decrease compared to natural gas, resulting in a comparable carbon footprint to the conventional (naphtha cracking) process. Further, aside from ethylene production onshore, plasma reactors can also be employed for ethylene production offshore, thereby valorizing currently wasted rich-in-methane gas streams and thus reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,3,0,23,,,2398-4902,,,,,,,,,,,"Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Chem Engn, Proc Engn Sustainable Syst ProcESS, Celestijnenlaan 200F, B-3001 Leuven, BelgiumLIST, 5 Ave Hauts Fourneaux, L-4362 Esch Sur Alzette, LuxembourgNatl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Chem Engn, Iroon Polytech 9, Athens 15780, Greece",,,,2020-03-24,WOS:000518690900035,,

J,,,,,,,,,Rob Harris,,Implementation of Tidal Energy Extraction in FVCOM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Feb 01 2014,2014,"This internship will be hosted by the Oceanography group at Marine Scotland Science (MSS). Marine Scotland is a directorate of the Scottish Government and is the lead marine management organisation in Scotland. It is responsible for the licensing, regulation and spatial planning of marine renewable energy developments within Scotland. The Oceanography group advices the Marine Scotland licensing and operations team on the potential consequences of tidal energy development in Scottish waters, and uses a number of resources including hydrodynamic models.Scotland has substantial wave and tidal energy resources and is at the forefront of the development of marine renewable technologies and ocean energy exploitation. The next phase will see these wave and tidal devices deployed in arrays, with many sites being developed. Although developers have entered into agreements with The Crown Estate for seabed leases, all projects remain subject to licensing requirements under the Marine Scotland Act (2010). As part of the licensing arrangements, environmental effects in the immediate vicinity of devices and arrays will be addressed in the EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) process that each developer must undertake. It is essential, however, that the regulatory authorities, Marine Scotland, understand how a number of multi-site developments collectively impact on the physical processes over a wider region, both in relation to cumulative effects of the developments and marine planning responsibilities. At a regional scale, careful selection of sites may enable the optimum exploitation of the resource while minimising any environmental impacts to an acceptable level.In order to achieve a clearer understanding of the impact on the physical processes due to tidal energy extraction accurate models need to be developed that truly simulate the methodology of extraction. It is this complex process where the greatest uncertainty in modelling clearly lies and this internship deals directly with the methodology of energy extraction and its incorporation into FVCOM. - The Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) is a 3D unstructured-grid, finite-volume, free-surface coastal circulation model developed at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, USA. FVCOM is an open-source model and has a growing, predominantly academic, user base in Scotland and the UK (see Case for Support for further details).- MSS has adopted FVCOM as their preferred model for modelling the coastal and shelf seas of Scotland. Scotland's wave and tidal energy industry is leading the world, and the Scottish Government is actively encouraging investment and pursuing research to better understand the consequences of wave and tidal energy development. There is therefore a need for MSS to develop coastal hydrodynamics models that can simulate the extraction of wave and tidal energy, in order to understand the physical consequences.- TeraWatt (EPSRC 2012-2015) will have produced position papers on energy extraction methodologies by Jan 2014, which will be made available to the Internship. A methodology should be developed as part of other, contracted out, MSS work and it is hoped that this might also be available for the project.- Other models (Mike, Delft3D) have implemented energy extraction, albeit in a crude manner, and similar approaches could be used. It is also hoped that other, more novel, approaches will be researched and adopted as part of the internship.- The ultimate aim of the internship is to develop and implement method(s) for simulating the extraction of tidal stream energy in FVCOM.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/L013959/1,,,,,,,,Heriot-Watt University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15400877,,

A Horizontal Axial Tidal Turbine (HATT) with unidirectional foils has to be able to face the current directions in order to maximize current energy harvesting. There are two regular solutions to keep a HATT always facing the direction of the flow, which are transferred from wind turbine applications. One is to yaw the turbine around the supporting structure with a yaw mechanism. The other is to reverse the blade pitch angle through 180 degrees with a pitch-adjusting mechanism. The above solutions are not cost-effective in marine applications due to the harsh marine environment and high cost of installation and maintenance. In order to avoid the above disadvantages, a turbine with bidirectional foils is presented in this paper. A bare turbine with bidirectional foils is characterized in that it has nearly the same energy conversion capability in both tidal current directions without using the yaw or pitch mechanism. Considering the working conditions of the bidirectional turbine in which the turbine is installed on a mono-pile, the effect of the mono-pile on the turbine's performance is evaluated in this paper, especially when the turbine is downstream of the mono-pile. The paper was focused on the evaluation of the hydrodynamic performance of the bidirectional turbine. The hydrodynamic performance of the bare bidirectional turbine without any supporting structure was evaluated based on a steady-state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and model tests. Performance comparison has been made between the turbine with bidirectional foils and the turbine with NACA foils. The effect of the mono-pile on the performance of the bidirectional turbine was studied by using the steady-state and the transient CFD model. The steady-state CFD model was used to evaluate the effect of the mono-pile clearance, which is the distance between the mono-pile and the turbine on the performance of the turbine. The transient CFD model was used to determine the time-dependent characteristics of the turbine, such as time-dependent power and drag coefficients. The results show that the bare bidirectional turbine has nearly the same energy conversion capability in both tidal current directions. The performance of the bidirectional turbine is inferior to the turbine with NACA foils. At the designed tip speed ratio, the power coefficient of the turbine with NACA foils is 0.4498, which increases by 1.6% compared to the 0.4338 of the bidirectional turbine. The turbine's performance decreases due to the introduction of the mono-pile, and the closer the turbine is to the mono-pile, the greater effect on the turbine's performance the mono-pile has. At the designed clearance of 1.5 D-S, the presence of a mono-pile decreases the peak Cp value by 1.82% and 3.17% to a value of 0.4156 and 0.4004 for the turbine located in the mono-pile upstream and downstream, respectively.

Besides energy production, these structures can also provide new artificial habitats to a diversity of fish and crustacean species. This study characterises how concrete mattresses that stabilise the submarine power cable of a tidal energy test site can increase habitat capacity for benthic megafauna. A five-year monitoring, which relied on both visual counts and video-based surveys by divers, revealed that these mattresses provide a suitable habitat for 5 taxa of large crustaceans and fish. In particular, two commercially valuable species, i.e. the edible crab Cancer pagurus and the European lobster Homarus gammarus, showed a constant occupancy of these artificial habitats throughout the course of the project. The shape and the number of shelters available below individual mattresses largely determine potential for colonisation by mobile megafauna. Local physical characteristics of the implantation site (e.g. substratum type, topography, exposition to current etc.) significantly impact amount and type of shelters provided by the concrete mattresses.

Causal factors include world population growth at present and growing exponentially. Increases of personal incomes and wealth have created more increased consumption of public/private housing transit and transportation which have in turn increased demand for raw materials, natural and mining resources such as gas, coal, oil sand and ocean oil/gas exploration.The melting of the North Pole's glaciers has affected the ocean levels flooding of river and creeks and as well affected agricultural production on a major scale.In order to have clean environment on earth, we need a flexible management to cope with global warming and its impact on our quality of life. An alternative to coal and fossil fuels which are directly causing climate change through heat-trapping gases that are warming the atmosphere must be technologically found and implemented as early as possible. A mix alternative and clean energy such as solar panels, hydro, wind-turbines and bio-mass energy system has to be developed and implemented. This requires a close cooperation among public institutions, private industry, technical experts, university researchers, financially and administratively, among all nations. Nuclear energy can be considered as an alternative clean energy and must be developed and also monitored for the safety.According to the world wildlife fund Canada released a list of the ten top Canadian cities in terms of greenhouse gas emission reductions, municipal targets, green building codes and green transportation, Vancouver ranked first, with a score of 8.1 out of ten, followed by Toronto (7.2) and Montreal (6.2). Vancouver has reduced emission to 1990 is the only Municipality on track to meet Kyoto and has the greenest building code in Canada.Some of the important Green Energy Strategy and Development in Canada have been designed and implemented by various Provinces listed as follows:B.C. established the BC forest and range practices act (BCFRPA) which was one of the first in North America requiring tenure holders to pursue sustainable forest management planning and to provide measurable results.Ontario Provincial Government passed a new green act to explore solar, wind, water and biomass new technological energy. The world's biggest solar farms as an example, is in Enbridge's 80-megawatt power project on 380 hectares near Sarnia, Ontario. The goal is to make solar cells more efficient. Electrovaya Inc. of Mississauga, Ontario has developed and advanced enough to get electric cars such as ChevyVolt onto the market.Society on Earth must think about energy and be conscious of its use. People must understand that what they can do to conserve energy will have cumulative effect. Also, people need to act on their responsibility.

The inlet connects the Cabras lagoon to the gulf through a series of convoluted creeks and man-made structures, including a dam and fish barriers built in the last three decades. Sediments were muddy and mainly composed of the non-sortable fraction (i.e., < 8 mu m particle size) in all four areas investigated: Lagoon, Creeks, Channel and Seaward. Along the inlet, however, the ratio between the < 8 mu mn and the 8-64 mu m fractions was highest in Creeks and Channel, between the fish barriers and the dam, suggesting impaired hydrodynamics. Consistently, steep gradients in water salinity, temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations were found in proximity to the fish barriers. The whole inlet was characterized by a major organic enrichment of sediments, with up to an annual mean of 33.6% of organic matter and 11.7% of total organic carbon in Seaward due to the presence of seagrass leaf litter. Acid-volatile sulphide and chromium-reduced sulphur concentrations were highest throughout the year in Seaward and Lagoon, respectively, with a peak in summer. Consistently, the whole inlet supported low structured macrofaunal assemblages dominated by few opportunist species, with a relatively lower diversity in Lagoon throughout the year and the highest abundances in Seaward in summer. We infer that the presence of artificial structures along the inlet, such as fish barriers and the dam, impair the lagoon-gulf hydrodynamics, sediment exchange and animal recruitment and colonization. We suggest that the removal of these structures would favour water renewal in the Cabras lagoon, but would also increase the outflow of organic C-bonding fine particles into the gulf with serious consequences for Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa seagrass meadows. We conclude that all possible consequences of such initiatives should be carefully considered before any action is taken. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The impacts of these anthropogenic modifications of coastlines on fish populations are poorly described, and little is known about factors affecting the ecological performance of these novel habitats for fish. We compared the abundance and community structure of fish assemblages associated with artificial coastal defence structures built in either rocky or sedimentary contexts at two locations along the coast of Sicily, to explore whether the performance of the artificial habitats for fish changed in relation to the characteristics of the surrounding natural habitat. We also quantified how fish associated with artificial structures in either habitat contexts differed from that at nearby natural rocky reefs. We found that fish assemblages differed in abundance and structure between artificial coastal defences deployed in sandy contexts vs natural rocky reefs, with different ecological taxa showing greater (i.e. benthic carnivorous) or lower (i.e. serranids) abundances in the artificial habitat. We also found that fish assemblages associated to artificial structures built on rocky bottoms had inconsistent outcomes, more frequently grouping with artificial sandy habitats at one location and with natural rocky reefs at the other. These results suggest that the surrounding environmental setting could have an overriding, and so far largely overlooked, importance in affecting the performance of artificial structures as habitats and in facilitating the development of fish assemblage with distinctive composition and structure.

The protection of the Tegnue, in experimental way, has been achieved by submarine laying of 1630 concrete blocks, called Habitat (R), at a depth of about 20 m, in the surroundings of 78 Tegnue overall. These submerged structures purpose, in addition to keep the fishing boats away from the natural environment, to increase the bottom biodiversity and to enrich the local fish populations. So the artificial reefs can promote the presence and the reproduction of some market valuable fish species.Now, after a four year study (2006 2009) the features of the artificial structures that we used in our project and the results of the analysis of the macrobenthos that has colonized the blocks surfaces during one year, are shown and discussed extensively.Seasonal surveys were carried out to study the trend of species richness and the abundance of the pioneer colonizers of these artificial structures (above all Polychaetes, Molluscs and Crustaceans).

This project will establish and evaluate a desing feedback process which can protect and perhaps enhance the natural environment, which allowing energy extraction to be maximised.Engineers will work with project and device developers to establish approriate development scenarios which will then be considered using state of the art modelling techniques to assess the levels of ecological impact across a range of key ecological parameters. This modelling will establish the levels of impact and the sensitivity of key impacts to changes in array and device design parameters. Stakeholders will be involved in assessing the acceptablity of predicted ecological changes and the prospects of ecological benefit being enhanced.The process loop will be completed by feeding the impact analysis findings back into the array design process to start a further iteration of the desing, impact and acceptability assessment process.It is anticipated that typically three iterations will be needed for the development scanarios to establish and refine the process to the benefit of the broader marine energy sector.This project crosses borders from research led-engineering design, offshore engineering and marine operations to ecological science, measurement and physical modelling expertise within the consortium. The parallels between wind and wet renewable will be utilised to link from early development shallow water wind and tidal streams to floating wave and wind in deeper water. The consortium will engage with Marine Scotland and MMO from the start of the project and at key intervals through the projectThe project will proceed by interactive collaboration between: system designers; physical modellers and ecologists; regulators and project developers.Appropriate response models will be established based upon direct involvement and interaction with cutting edge research being conducted within NERC, EPSRC; ETI and CEC funded research programmes. A clear imperative for the first stage is to refine the choice of criterion from which to judge environmental benefit, particularly when upscaling, e.g. fisheries enhancement, acoustics, animal movement corridors.These will then be used by the physical and ecological modellers to produce a series of configuration scenarios.The engineering specialists in the project will identify portfolios of appropriate case studies of array developments and state of the art array modelling tools. Case studies will be developed and interpreted using the techniques established above . The engagement of developers, trade associations, EMEC and Wave Hub is fundamental for specialist input and dissemination and the results will be interpreted in association with these broader stakeholder communities. This will be through workshops arranged to coordinate structured debate and cross consortium feedback.This process will be, fundamentally an iterative procedure, with effective closure of the design, ecological assessment and constraint quantification process loop requiring multiple circuits prior to acceptable compromises being reached.Management PlanA steering committee drawn from the investigators and incorporating representatives from wind, wave and tidal developers and invited representatives from the regulators will assess and guide progress.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/J004286/1,,,,,,,,University of Exeter,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15354202,,

Fundamental to this is the determination of the design loads to support the Rule requirements and for application in direct calculations. To date, the current design philosophy for the prediction of motions and wave-induced loads has been driven by empirical or first-principles calculation procedures based on well-proven applications such as ship motion prediction programs. In recent years, the software, engineering and computer technology available to predict the design loads imposed on ships and offshore structures has improved dramatically. Notwithstanding, with the stepwise increase in the size and structural complexity of ships and floating offshore installations and the advances in the framework of Rules and Standards it has become necessary to utilise the latest technologies to assess the design loads on new designs. Along the lines of the recommendations from the International Ship and Offshore Structures Committee (ISSC) 1.2 on Loads this paper reviews some of the recent advances in the assessment of loads for ships and offshore structures with the aim to draw the overall technological landscape available for further understanding, validation and implementation by the academic and industrial communities. Particular emphasis is attributed on methodologies applicable for the prediction of environmental and operational loads from waves, wind, current, ice, slamming, sloshing and operational factors. Consideration is also given to deterministic and statistical load predictions based on model experiments, full-scale measurements and theoretical methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A causal link between exposure and symptoms is not indicated by empirical evidence. Research indicates symptoms may be explained by the nocebo response, whereby health concerns and negative expectations, created from social discourse and media reports, trigger symptom reporting.Objective: The experimental aim was to test whether providing a nocebo explanation for symptoms, to individuals reporting symptomatic experiences during infrasound exposure, would ameliorate symptoms during further exposure.Method: Sixty-six volunteers were randomly assigned to nocebo explanation or biological explanation groups. Participants were concurrently exposed to infrasound and audible windfarm sound, while reporting on current symptoms and mood, during two exposure sessions. Preceding session one, participants watched a presentation integrating media warnings about purported health risks posed by windfarm infrasound. Before session two, nocebo explanation participants viewed material outlining how nocebo responding could explain symptom reporting. Instead biological explanation participants watched material presenting pathophysiological theories for symptoms.Results: During session one, participants reported increased symptoms and mood deterioration from baseline assessment. During session two symptom reporting and mood deterioration was maintained by biological explanation participants, while mood and symptoms reported by nocebo explanation participants returned to baseline levels.Conclusion: Results indicate that providing an explanation of the nocebo response, followed by exposure to infrasound, has the potential to operate as an intervention to reduce symptomatic experiences in people reporting symptoms attributed to windfarm generated infrasound.

The paedomorphic (neotenous) smooth newts in Aremark, Ostfold (Norway). - Fauna 64(2-4): 50-59 In May 2010, two paedomorphic (neotenous) smooth newts Triturus (Lissotriton) vulgaris were captured in a little lake in Aremark, Ostfold in southeastern Norway. One of them was a one year old and 49 mm long larva; the other one was a female of about 80 mm total length. The larva was kept in an aquarium for two years, without metamorphosing, and in May 2012 released in the lake from where it was captured. At the time of release it measured 104 mm and showed clearly female secondary sex characteristics, except that the grey-spotted belly had no orange colouringNew investigations of the lake were made in May/ June and in September 2012, when a high number of paedomorphs was found, consisting of adult and subadult newts of both sexes and many larvae. Adult paedomorphs lack reddish or orange colour on their bellies. However, also normal and normally coloured, metamorphic newts exist at the place; which morph is in majority is not known.The locality, here called, Salamandertjern, is about 15 000 m(2) large and situated ca. 220 m above sea level. The surroundings are mostly rocky hills with spruce or pine forest, which in part has been logged. The aquatic vegetation is sparse. In 2010, the Ca2+ concentration of the water was 4.5 mg/L, and the pH was 67. About 20 years earlier, in 1989, the lake had a Ca2+ concentration of only 1.3 mg/L and a pH as low as 4.6 At that time newts were not found, and the lake had barely amphibians at all. The reason for the rise in Ca2+ and pH is the liming of the lake, which started about 2001-2002 and continued (so far) till 2010. The hydrographical history of the lake thus indicates that the newt population there is probably younger than year 2001, and the paedomorphy still younger.Facultative paedomorphic newts are very rare in Scandinavia, and only one known record up till now (before the present records) has been made in Norway. Paedomorphy has a genetic component and appears now and then in normal newt populations. Under special environmental conditions, paedomorphic individuals can then be selected before normal, metamorphic individuals. Factors that have been associated with paedomorphy in newts are: Low concentration of iodine- or high concentration of calcium etc. in the water, permanent aquatic sites with abundance of prey surrounded by an unfavourable terrestrial habitat, short activity season on land, steep banks surrounding the lake, and - most important: no, or only few, effective predators in the water.The most important threat to the very special and vulnerable smooth newt population in Salamandertjern is the (illegal) release of fish. Secondly, also a drop in pH as a result of terminated liming practice may be serious. In addition, there is a possibility that the area will be developed by building a wind power plant, i.e. a high number of wind turbines, and also of new roads with increased traffic.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0014-8881,,,,,,,,,,,"NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2011-01-01,BCI:BCI201300253801,,

This paper proposes a new method to achieve the resonant behavior of a point absorber floating buoy type of WEC using a mechanical power take-off system. By using the inertia characteristics of a hydraulic flywheel accumulator-based electro-hydraulic actuator to change the corresponding supplementary mass of the floating buoy, the total mass of the buoy was close to a match with the relatively low frequency of the wave, so that the buoy was in resonance with the wave. The specifications of the hydraulic flywheel accumulator system were proposed and studied. The working principle was analyzed, and a mathematical model was then derived to investigate the system operation. An experimental set-up was implemented to validate the mathematical model.

A mooring type of FAD with a horizontal axis turbine (HAT) or a vertical axis turbine (VAT) was designed to avoid an unexpected collision with fishes. The characteristics of fluid force on FAD were investigated by numerical and theoretical works assuming steady state in time and the motions of FAD were also examined by experimental works. The proposed FAD can achieve 15% reduction for averaged snap load and 30% for maximum one. The amplitudes of surge, sway and heave motions excited by vortex-induced vibration (VIV) in wave-current conditions can be reduced up to 50%. The current flow around FAD and designed turbine was computed by CFD to estimate hydrodynamic force and vortex field.

Pilings influenced these patterns and processes directly due to the provision of shade and indirectly by altering abundances of sea-urchins which, in turn, affected covers of bryozoans.

MREDs are part of an ongoing large-scale modification of coastal waters that also includes activities such as commercial fishing, shipping, aggregate extraction, aquaculture, dredging, spoil-dumping and oil and gas exploitation. It is increasingly accepted that developments, of any kind, should only proceed if they are ecologically sustainable and will not reduce current or future delivery of ecosystem services. The benthos underpins crucial marine ecosystem services yet, in relation to MREDs, is currently poorly monitored: current monitoring programmes are extensive and costly yet provide little useful data in relation to ecosystem-scale-related changes, a situation called 'data-rich, information-poor' (DRIP). MRED -benthic interactions may cause changes that are of a sufficient scale to change ecosystem services provision, particularly in terms of fisheries and biodiversity and, via trophic linkages, change the distribution of fish, birds and mammals. The production of DRIPy data should be eliminated and the resources used instead to address relevant questions that are logically bounded in time and space. Efforts should target identifying metrics of change that can be linked to ecosystem function or service provision, particularly where those metrics show strongly non-linear effects in relation to the stressor. Future monitoring should also be designed to contribute towards predictive ecosystem models and be sufficiently robust and understandable to facilitate transparent, auditable and timely decision-making.",,,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,24,0,51,,,1364-0321,,,,,,,,,,,"SAMS, Scottish Marine Inst, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, ScotlandCranfield Univ, Ctr Offshore Renewable Energy & Engn, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Bldg 52, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, EnglandDeltares, Delft, NetherlandsPlymouth Univ, Marine Inst, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandNormandie Univ, UNICAEN, UMR UCN M2C, UR,CNRS 6143, 24 Rue Tilleuls, F-14000 Caen 5, FranceMarine Inst, Galway, IrelandUniv Gdansk, Inst Oceanog, Al Marsz Pilsudskiego 46, Gdynia, PolandUniv Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, EstoniaRoyal Belgian Inst Nat Sci RBINS, Operat Directorate Nat Environm Marine Ecol & Man, 3e 23e Linieregimentspl, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium",SAMS,,,2017-06-09,WOS:000401492900061,,

Structurally, the ecological response begins with high diversity and biomass in the flora and fauna that gradually colonize the complex hard substrate habitat. The species may include nonindigenous ones that are extending their spatial distributions and/or strengthening populations, locally rare species (e.g., hard substrate-associated fish), and habitat-forming species that further increase habitat complexity. Functionally, the response begins with dominant suspension feeders that filter organic matter from the water column. Their fecal deposits alter the surrounding seafloor communities by locally increasing food availability, and higher trophic levels (fish, birds, marine mammals) also profit from locally increased food availability and/or shelter.

Novel hard substratum, introduced through offshore developments, can provide habitat for marine species and thereby function as an artificial reef. To predict the ecological consequences of deploying offshore infrastructure, and sustainably manage the installation of new structures, interactions between artificial reefs and marine ecosystem functions and services must be understood. This requires quantitative data on the relationships between secondary productivity and artificial reef design, across all trophic levels. Benthic secondary productivity is, however, one of the least studied processes on artificial reefs.2. In this study, we show that productivity rates of a common suspension feeder, Flustra foliacea (Linnaeus 1758), were 2.4 times higher on artificial reefs constructed from complex blocks than on reefs constructed from simple blocks, which had a smaller surface area.3. Productivity rates were highest on external areas of reefs. Productivity rates decreased by 1.56%, per cm distance into the reef on complex reefs and 2.93% per cm into the reef on simple block reefs. The differences in productivity rates between reefs constructed from simple and complex blocks are assumed to reflect different current regimes and food supply between the external and internal reef areas, according to reef type.4. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that artificial reef design can affect secondary productivity at low trophic levels. We demonstrate that the incorporation of voids into reef blocks can lead to a greater proportion of the structure serving as functional habitat for benthic species. By including such modifications into the design of artificial reefs, it may be possible to increase the overall productivity capacity of artificial structures.",,,,,,,,,26,0,1,0,14,0,27,,,2045-7758,,,,,,,,,,,"Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban, Argyll, ScotlandHeriot Watt Univ Orkney, Int Ctr Isl Technol, Stromness, Scotland",,,,2020-02-08,WOS:000511747600001,32128143,

Structures that simulated flooded dead trees were most successful in attracting breeding waterbirds. Reedbeds were used for nesting when the number of such artificial structures was reduced. When the reedbeds were removed some birds returned to the artificial structures, whereas others moved to a more distant wetland.

LCA is the most powerful environmental impact assessment tool from a product perspective and ReCiPe is one of the most advanced LCA methodologies with the broadest set of mid-point impact categories. More importantly, ReCiPe combines the strengths of both mid-point-based life cycle impact assessment approach of CML-IA, and end-point-based approach of Eco-indicator 99 methods. Accordingly, the LCA results of all four solar PV technologies have been evaluated and compared based on 18 mid-point impact indicators (viz., climate change, ozone depletion, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, human toxicity, photochemical oxidant formation, particulate matter formation, terrestrial ecotoxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine ecotoxicity, ionising radiation, agricultural land occupation, urban land occupation, natural land transformation, water depletion, metal depletion and fossil depletion), 3 end-point/damage indicators (viz., human health, ecosystems and cost increases in resource extraction) and a unified single score.

This study provides an assessment of Alaska's offshore wind resource, the first such assessment for Alaska, using a 14-year, high-resolution simulation from a numerical weather prediction and regional climate model. This is the longest-known high-resolution model data set to be used in a wind resource assessment. Widespread areas with relatively shallow ocean depth and high long-term average 100-m wind speeds and estimated net capacity factors over 50% were found, including a small area near Alaska's population centers and the largest transmission grid that, if even partially developed, could provide the bulk of the state's energy needs. The regional climate simulations were validated against available radiosonde and surface wind observations to provide the confidence of the model-based assessment.

During the Late Ordovician the region around Gotland was part of a shallow epicratonic basin in the southern subtropics. In these warm-water environments algae flourished, diverse reefs developed close to the coastline and further outboard carbonate mounds developed. These mounds formed rigid high relief structures surrounded by fine-grained siliciclastics and marls and can be detected on seismic images as isolated concave upwards features. The sedimentary succession beneath Gotland was intensely investigated in the 1970s and 1980s for its hydrocarbon potential, and subsequently, oil was commercially produced from reservoirs within Ordovician mounds. In 1981, a 3D seismic survey was conducted by Horizon Exploration Ltd. over the Fardume mound on northern Gotland. To date no results from these 3D data have been published in scientific literature.The region of Gotland aims to produce 100% of its energy from renewable sources and currently much of Gotland's electricity is provided by wind turbines. Due to the intermittent nature of wind power, one solution to regulate the supply of electricity from wind energy is Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES).In this study, we convert the 3D seismic survey acquired over the Fardume mound from scanned TIFF images to SEGY format. These data are then utilized together with well data to gain a better knowledge of the geological structure of the mound and to examine its reservoir characteristics and potential for CAES. To date, carbonate mounds on Gotland have mainly been reported in the scientific literature using well data. This 3D seismic survey, therefore, provides a rare opportunity to better characterize and investigate the structure of one of the carbonate mounds on Gotland. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Four representative power plants onshore (with 2.3 and 3.2 MW turbines) and offshore (4.0 and 6.0 MW turbines) with 2015 state-of-the-art technology data provided by Siemens Wind Power were assessed. The energy payback time was found to be less than 1 year for all technologies. The emissions of greenhouse gases amounted to less than 7 g CO2-eq/kWh for onshore and 11 g CO2-eq/kWh for offshore. Climate change impacts were found to be a good indicator for overall hotspot identification however attention should also be drawn to human toxicity and impacts from respiratory inorganics. The overall higher impact of offshore plants, compared to onshore ones, is mainly due to larger high impact material requirements for capital infrastructure. In both markets the bigger turbines with more advanced direct drive generator technology is shown to perform better than the smaller geared ones. Capital infrastructure is the most impactful life cycle stage across impacts. It accounts for more than 79% and 70% of climate change impacts onshore and offshore respectively. The end-of-life treatment could lead to significant savings due to recycling, ca. 20-30% for climate change. In the manufacturing stage the impacts due to operations at the case company do not exceed 1% of the total life cycle impacts. This finding highlights the shared responsibility across multiple stakeholders and calls for collaborative efforts for comprehensive environmental management across organizations in the value chain. Real life examples are given in order to showcase how LCA results can inform decisions, e.g. for concept and product development and supply chain management. On a systems level the results can be used by energy planners when comparing with alternative energy sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

They add novel habitat for hard-substrate organisms and modify the surrounding environment. Most research to date has focused on the communities living directly on artificial structures, and more research is needed on the potential impacts these structures have on nearby communities and the surrounding environment. We compared the sedimentary habitat surrounding two types of artificial structures (pilings and seawalls) to sediments adjacent to rocky reefs using a combination of traditional sediment analyses, stable isotope analysis, and environmental DNA. Artificial and natural shore sediments were best differentiated by sediment variables strongly associated with flow speed. Pilings sediments had significantly finer grain size, higher organic content, and generally lower C:N ratios than sediments adjacent to the other habitat types, suggesting flow is reduced by pilings. Sedimentary assemblages near pilings were also consistent with those predicted under low-flow conditions, with elevated bacterial colonization and increased relative abundances of small deposit feeders compared with other habitat types. Additionally, lumbrinerid polychaetes in pilings sediments had reduced delta N-15 values, suggesting different detrital resources and fewer trophic linkages compared with lumbrinerids in other habitats. Woody detritus was greater adjacent to seawalls than to natural rocky shores or pilings. Our findings suggest that artificial structures have the potential to influence adjacent soft sediments through changes to sediment properties that affect infaunal and microbial communities, as well as trophic linkages for some consumers. We hypothesize that this is due to a combination of altered flow, differing detrital subsidies, and differing adjacent land-use among habitat types. Managers should consider the potential for changed sediment properties and ecology when deciding where to build different types of artificial structures. Further manipulative experiments are needed to understand mechanisms of change and help manage the impacts of artificial structures on the seafloor.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,7,0,8,,,0141-1136,1879-0291,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Box 351800, Seattle, WA 98195 USAMacquarie Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, AustraliaUniv New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaSydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW 2088, AustraliaNatl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, 16 Sci Dr 4, Singapore 117558, SingaporeMacquarie Univ, Dept Environm Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000452943500028,30401483,

In this context, protective refers to coatings for containers, offshore constructions, wind turbines, storage tanks, bridges, rail cars, and petrochemical plants while marine refers to coatings for ballast tanks, cargo holds and cargo tanks, decks, and engine rooms on ships. The review aims at providing a thorough picture of state-of-the-art in anticorrosive coatings systems. International and national legislation aiming at reducing the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have caused significant changes in the anticorrosive coating industry. The requirement for new VOC-compliant coating technologies means that coating manufacturers can no longer rely on the extensive track record of their time-served products to convince consumers of their suitability for use. An important aspect in the development of new VOC-compliant, high-performance anticorrosive coating systems is a thorough knowledge of the components in anticorrosive coatings, their interactions, their advantages and limitations, as well as a detailed knowledge on the failure modes of anticorrosive coatings. This review, which mainly deals with European experience and practice, includes a description of the different environments an anticorrosive coating system may encounter during service. In addition, examples of test methods and standards for determination of the performance and durability of anticorrosive coatings have been included. The different types of anticorrosive coatings are presented, and the most widely applied generic types of binders and pigments in anticorrosive coatings are listed and described. Furthermore, the protective mechanisms of barrier, sacrificial, and inhibitive coatings are outlined. In the past decades, several alternatives to organic solvent-borne coatings have reached the commercial market. This review also presents some of these technologies and discusses some of their advantages and limitations. Finally, some of the mechanisms leading to degradation and failure of organic coating systems are described, and the reported types of adhesion loss are discussed.",,,,,,,,,636,31,0,0,19,2,717,,,1547-0091,1935-3804,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, DenmarkHempel AS, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Hempel AS,,,2009-06-01,WOS:000264843600001,,

The resultant communities are usually dominated by sessile marine invertebrates that tend to utilize suspension-feeding for nutritional gain from the water column. Not all suspension-feeders are filtration-feeders but in general terms a large suspension-feeding community will provide varying scales of water filtration. The potential for utilizing some form of in-water biofiltration in association with localised organic enrichment has long been suggested but with few quantitative estimates of probable efficacy. The major taxa that are likely to be relevant to the process of biofiltration are discussed in relation to the functional classification of suspension-feeders. In order to generate estimates of biofiltration potential, activity rates of the major functional and taxonomic groups of suspension-feeders are derived through a review of the general mode of suspension-feeding, the predominant food sources with the size range of particles retained and individual suspension-feeding rates that are scaled up to the population level. However, any naturally occurring fouling community will consist of a number of species and so estimates of multispecies suspension-feeding, interspecific interactions, rates of biodeposition and nutrient release are derived. The rates and densities of biofouling are dependent of the abiotic and biotic characteristics of the receiving environment and the types of materials used in the provided substrate. The factors affecting biofouling are discussed in relation to existing examples of artificial structures found in European waters or waters of relevance to Europe. In-water outputs from finfish mariculture provide examples of localised point sources of organic enrichment that could benefit from the associated deployments of biological filters. Using estimates of filtration clearance rates combined with the major taxa thought most likely to dominate any filtering community, probable scales of biofiltration required in order to influence the levels of mariculture discharges are calculated. Although, in theory, biofilters in open system finfish mariculture may reduce the levels of organic impact, the scale of intervention required to make a significant effect would probably exceed any form of economic viability.",,,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,20,0,27,,,0078-3218,,0-8493-3597-3,,,,,,,,,"Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Dunstaffnage Marine Res Lab, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000232951200004,,

In recent decades, changes in land use and increasing population density have accelerated the delivery rates of nutrients (particularly nitrogen) from terrestrial sources to aquatic biomes. Humans now contribute more reactive nitrogen (N) to the hydro- and biospheres than all other natural N sources combined. Aquatic habitats have in turn responded with nuisance algal blooms, changes in species composition, impacts on fin and shellfish resources, and deleterious economic consequences. As streams and rivers trend closer towards nitrogen saturation, increasing amounts of nitrogen pollution are exported to the coastal margins where it promotes expanded severity and duration of hypoxic events. An understanding of the fate and transport of N through the entire aquatic continuum (e.g. streams, rivers and estuaries) is necessary for identifying zones that are particularly susceptible to N inputs, and those that act as hot spots for N removal. Knowledge of the hydrologic and chemical mechanisms controlling N reactivity provides the foundation for guiding nutrient management strategies and for enhancing the natural capacity of these environments to attenuate N loads. Measurement of denitrification, the only mechanism that represents absolute attenuation of nitrogen, has been examined across a wide range of aquatic ecotypes. However, one particular segment of the aquatic continuum, tidal freshwater rivers and streams, has generally escaped inquiry. Connecting upland streams and rivers to estuaries, we suggest that tidal freshwater streams possess unique hydrology, geomorphology, and chemical reactivity that optimize for N removal relative to any other component of the aquatic continuum. Further, we propose that enhanced N removal can be generated in non tidal systems simply by inducing a quasi-tidal hydrologic regime (i.e. by generating a rhythmic rise and fall in water level). Investigators propose to combine extensive hydro-chemical monitoring efforts in Coastal Plain streams in the Southeastern U.S. with a unique series of chemical tracer studies, and stream modeling. All work is to be conducted in situ under natural and hydrologically-manipulated conditions. Tidal streams are dominant aquatic features of the Southeastern US, and the proposed work will help to determine the extent to which they are a hotspot for N removal on broad geographic scales. The research represents a federal-academic partnership that will provide a better understanding of how nutrient loading in watersheds translates into ecosystem response along continental margins. Work of this nature is essential for improving predictions of habitat response to human perturbation and/or restoration effects, assessing resiliency of aquatic habitats, refining regulatory targets for nutrient loading. The mechanistic picture of how hydrology and chemistry interact to regulate N processing provides the critical foundation for developing simple low-cost technologies that enchance natural N attenuation and thereby improve water quality.

Specific geographical differences in community composition, diversity and successional development have been identified, however, and these are discussed in relation to environmental conditions and larval dispersal. In practical terms, the conservation of offshore fouling communities depends upon the fates of structures supporting these assemblages. Since the U.K.'s approach to platform decommissioning could ultimately involve the in situ-toppling of structures in sea depths greater than 100 m, there would appear to be little threat to the long-term existence of offshore habitats for deep-water fouling assemblages. Moreover, an abundance of largely uninvestigated habitats for fouling organisms exists on submerged wrecks and other man-made structures.

The high cost of energy in the NANA region is one of the leading threats to the long term sustainability and wellbeing of the region. As a result of complex and lengthy logistics, the region has some of the highest energy prices in the nation. In addition to the cost of fossil fuels, NANA region residents are increasingly aware of the effects of greenhouse gases on climate change and the resulting coastal erosion along the Chukchi Sea.NANA Regional Corporation, along with other regional stakeholders, has developed a regional integrated energy plan. This approach includes community specific energy options analyses, benefit-cost analyses of competing alternatives, analysis of available literature and past experiences, surveying of professional opinion, and a regional energy summit that involved multiple stakeholders.Since the mid-1990s, the NANA region has been an Alaska leader in promoting and developing renewable energy resources with wind turbine installations in Kotzebue and Selawik. Promising wind energy potential is under investigation in several more communities, and other known energy resources being studied include geothermal, small-scale hydropower, and a substantial biomass potential in the upper Kobuk River area. Also under investigation arc stranded natural gas sources and even solar PV installations for some communities.Energy security in the region will be achieved by a combination of infrastructure improvement and development of appropriate energy technologies, both traditional and renewable. It is the vision of NANA region stakeholders to be 75% reliant on regionally available energy resources for heating and electric generation purposes by the year 2030, and to decrease the need for transportation fuel imported into the region by 50% by the year 2030. As part of this vision, imported fossil fuels would remain as emergency/back-up fuel only. With proper planning, a synergy can be developed between different energy sources and uses, with the composition of the optimal 'energy-mix' custom-tailored for each community in the NANA region. The energy planning process will be conducted with the understanding that the optimum mix may change over time.",,,,,3rd International Conference on Energy Sustainability3rd International Conference on Energy Sustainability,"JUL 19-23, 2009JUL 19-23, 2009","ASME, Adv Energy Syst Div; ASME, Solar Energy DivASME, Adv Energy Syst Div; ASME, Solar Energy Div","San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4889-0,,,,,,,,,"WHPacific Inc, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA",WHPacific Inc,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000281910700008,,

Although it is well documented that the materials comprising artificial structures influence the composition of organisms that use them as habitat, little is known about how these materials may chemically react with changing seawater conditions, and what effects this will have on associated biota. We investigated the effects of ocean warming, acidification, and type of coastal infrastructure material on algal turfs. Seawater acidification resulted in greater covers of turf, though this effect was counteracted by elevated temperatures. Concrete supported a greater cover of turf than granite or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) under all temperature and pH treatments, with the greatest covers occurring under simulated ocean acidification. Furthermore, photosynthetic efficiency under acidification was greater on concrete substratum compared to all other materials and treatment combinations. These results demonstrate the capacity to maximise ecological benefits whilst still meeting local management objectives when engineering coastal defense structures by selecting materials that are appropriate in an ocean change context. Therefore, mitigation efforts to offset impacts from sea-level rise and storms can also be engineered to alter, or even reduce, the effects of climatic change on biological assemblages.

Wind turbines and communications towers, which pose hazards to birds and bats in flight, are being erected or proposed across the United States and offshore. Human activities can also destroy or threaten habitats critical to birds during migratory passage, and climate change appears to be altering migratory patterns. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and other agencies are under increasing pressure to identify and evaluate movement patterns and habitats used during migration and other times. Few tools for deciphering migratory travels exist, but radar-based studies of movements and habitat use patterns in songbirds, waterfowl, and bats hold promise. The U.S. system of over 150 Doppler weather radars provides continental coverage, similar to the scale of bird migration. Although data stored from weather radar represent perhaps the second largest biological data archive in the world, use of those data is currently limited to technically savvy biologists who can handle the obscure data formats. Complementary mobile radar units and thermal and acoustic monitoring are also used in site-specific studies. Efforts to advance bird conservation and management through the use of radar arose independently in several USFWS/USGS collaborations. Recently, this coalition of scientists and resource managers identified the need to work together more closely to foster radar-related research and software development. U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists at Fort Collins Science Center, National Wetlands Research Center, Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, and Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, as well as USFWS Migratory Bird biologists across the country, are collaborating with university partners to develop a suite of products for managers. The goals are to identify migratory pathways and stopover sites for conservation, mitigation, and landscape planning; convey the importance of functional landscapes and unobstructed airspaces for migrating wildlife; enable use of radar by the wider biological, wind power, and related communities; and simplify the analysis of radar data. The long term focus is to use radar technologies to better understand movement patterns and habitat associations of migratory birds and other wildlife. Land managers and industry may use the knowledge and tools developed to optimize the siting of energy projects, other facilities, and migratory bird habitat projects.

An empirical analysis of oil and gas structures removed in the Gulf of Mexico between 1986 and 2001 provide the historic data required to compute the probability of an explosive removal and to estimate binary choice models for severance selection. Binomial logit and probit models of severance selection are constructed to establish the relationship between a set of attributes describing a structure and the probability that a particular severance technique will be employed.

The choice experiment asks how much are residents willing to pay above their current utility rates for offshore wind farms that increase marine species abundance and diversity with artificial reefs? We assess residents' willingness to pay (WTP) for different wind farm ownership models, and aesthetic impacts based on variation in distance from shore. Results of this exploratory study show strong preferences for wind farms that provide high quality artificial reef habitat, particularly among those who score high on the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP), a measure of environmental orientation. Results indicate WTP ranging from $17/month for people who score low on NEP to $31/month for people who score high on NEP for wind farms that generate a 60% increase in reef species diversity and abundance. We found significant preferences for cooperative, state or municipal ownership rather than private ownership.

Underwater noise generated during the installation of steel monopiles has recently received considerable attention from international environmental organizations and regulatory bodies in various nations. Collected data regarding underwater noise measurements indicate that pile driving operations, especially when impact hammers are used, can be potentially harmful for the marine ecosystem. In this paper, a linear semi-analytical model is developed for the study of the vibroacoustic behaviour of a coupled pile-soil-water system. The hammer is substituted by an external force applied at the head of the pile. The pile is described by a thin shell theory, whereas both soil and water are modelled as three-dimensional continua. The solution is based on the dynamic sub-structuring technique. The total system is divided into two subsystems namely, the shell structure and the soil-fluid medium. The response of each sub-domain is expressed as a summation over a complete set of eigenfunctions. The orthogonality of the shell modes in vacuo and the bi-orthogonality of the acousto-elastic modes is utilized in order to meet the displacement compatibility and the force equilibrium at the interface of the two sub-systems. With the developed model, the wave radiation due to vibratory and impact pile driving is analysed. The influence of soil elasticity and soil stratification on the dynamics of the coupled system is examined. In addition, the energy launched by the hammer into the water and into the soil is investigated for both excitation types in order to highlight the main differences in the generated wave field.",,,,,9th International Conference on Structural Dynamics (EURODYN)9th International Conference on Structural Dynamics (EURODYN),"JUN 30-JUL 02, 2014JUN 30-JUL 02, 2014",,"Porto, PORTUGALPorto, PORTUGAL",4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,2311-9020,,978-972-752-165-4,,,,,,,,,"Delft Univ Technol, Fac Engn & Geosci, Dept Civil Engn, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands",,,,2015-06-25,WOS:000354786604023,,

Although knots are one of the best known shorebird species in the Western Hemisphere, little is known about them in Uruguay. However, in 2007 the discovery of at least 312 dead knots at La Coronilla on the northern Atlantic coast of Uruguay attracted international attention to this part of the flyway. Here we present historical information gathered from museum collections, local ornithologists and literature to identify high-priority sites, as well as abundance and dates of occurrence of Red Knots along the Uruguayan coast. Information is also presented regarding the mortality event in 2007.To establish the current role of Uruguay in the Red Knot flyway, we also investigated phenology, minimum length of stay, connectivity with nearby Argentinian and Brazilian sites, and habitat use at a main Uruguayan site during northward migration from 2009 to 2011 and in the austral summer in 2007. We identified 96 historical records from 10 localities where Red Knots were detected at least once in the period 1951-2008. The number of birds per record ranged from 1 to >2,000, but most observations (ca. 80%) ranged from a few to 100 birds. The sites with more records of Red Knots and the highest counts were relatively flat sandy beaches of the dissipative morphodynamic type, which have a higher abundance of potential prey for Red Knots (especially Wedge Clams Donax hanleyanus), for instance Barra del Chuy beach, near the Brazilian border.Most historical observations occurred during northward migration in late austral summer and fall. The maximum count at Barra del Chuy was 1,191 birds in April 2010. However, very few birds were recorded in 2011. Median minimum length of stay of individually color-marked birds that were seen on at least two days was estimated as 5 days (range: 2-26 days). Several individual birds were observed on both sides of the Brazil-Uruguay border, suggesting that Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) and Barra del Chuy (Uruguay) should be treated as a single staging area. Resightings of Red Knots banded at Rio Grande (Tierra del Fuego non-breeding site) and San Antonio Oeste (a Patagonian stopover area) in Barra del Chuy, suggest that Rio Grande do Sul-Barra del Chuy and San Antonio Oeste function as independent moulting and fuelling areas for Red Knots en route north from Tierra del Fuego. Potential threats to the species in Uruguay are related to artificial freshwater discharge from rice fields negatively affecting Wedge Clams and other macrofauna, harmful algal blooms, and possible wind turbine establishment close to the coastline. Mass-mortality events were not recorded during the study period, and the cause of the mortality event that occurred in 2007 could not be determined.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,2058-8410,2058-8410,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Republica, Ctr Univ Reg Este, Dept Agr Syst and Cultural Landscapes, Biodivers Environm and Soc Grp, Montevideo, Uruguay",,,,2016-02-12,BCI:BCI201600197998,,

Staying on offshore substation is associated with an increased exposure to harmful health factors: physical, chemical, biological and psychophysical. The main sources of health risks on offshore substations are: temperature, electromagnetic field, noise from operating wind turbines, direct and alternating current, chemicals, Legionella bacteria and social isolation of people. The aim of this article is to draw attention to the problem of offshore substation workers' exposure to harmful factors and to present methods of preventing and reducing the risk-related adverse health effects. In this paper, there are identified and described risks occurring on offshore substations (fire, explosion, lightning, accidents at work). Some examples of the means and the methods for reducing the negative impact of exposure on the human health are presented and discussed.

They replace natural structures or add to the amount of hard substratum in an area and provide habitats for many fish and invertebrates. Previous work has concentrated on fish or on the invertebrates that occupy the primary substratum of artificial structures. Mussels often grow on different types of structures (pontoons, pilings, seawalls and natural reefs) and provide a secondary substratum for other organisms to inhabit. Counting and identifying organisms associated with mussel beds is traditionally done to species level, which is very time-consuming. To save time, organisms in this study were identified to coarse levels of taxonomic resolution (a mix of taxa, such as class, order, family and genus), which showed similar patterns to those when particularly speciose and abundant groups were identified to species. This study tests hypotheses that the distribution and abundance of mobile and sessile organisms that inhabit mussel beds will differ among natural and various types of artificial structures. When the associated assemblages of mussel beds from different types of structures and from different locations were examined, assemblages varied according to the type of structure they inhabited and its location. Assemblages associated with mussels on pontoons differed consistently from those on other types of structures. Patterns in the assemblages were also consistent through time. These data show that the types and amounts of artificial structures added to an environment can affect the types, distribution and abundances of organisms living in biogenic habitats.",,,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,30,0,34,,,1442-9985,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sydney, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Marine Ecol Labs A11, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,,,2006-04-01,WOS:000235693400015,,

The fouling community on the artificial structures was measured both quantitatively and qualitatively bi-monthly between June 2001 and December 2001. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to compare community structure between the study sites and locations. Artificial structures deployed at the mariculture site supported a higher epibiotic biomass than at the reference site at Oban and Eilat. Community composition was significantly different between the mariculture and reference site at Eilat. The biological succession oil the structures changed from an autotrophic to a heterotrophic mode over the experimental period at all locations with the exception of Oban, where negligible quantities of macroalgae were observed on the structures. Differences in community biomass and succession observed between artificial structures deployed at mariculture and reference sites, particularly in oligotrophic environments, may be caused by enhanced larval settlement and an elevated supply of particulate material and dissolved nutrients to structures adjacent to the fish cages.

The aim Should be the broad public denial of poison application and to consistently call to account people who illegally Set Out poison, which may only be achieved by raising awareness and public relation activities. Lead intoxication: lead shot and bullet fragments were discussed as sources of lead intoxication in White-tailed Eagles. It was agreed that the removal of hunter shot carcasses and gut piles left in the field may help to mitigate the problem in the short term. However, the switch to nontoxic ammunition is essential for the protection of large raptors, but also for human health. Collisions and electrocution: the four subtopics dealt with at the workshop were (a) collisions with vehicles, (b) collisions with wires, (c) collisions with wind power plants and (d) electrocution. The inspection for carrion and mitigation of particular railway line sections, wire-marking, the prevention of power lines and wind turbines in hazardous areas as well as the legal prohibition of killer poles were considered of major importance. As a precautionary principle, potential settlement areas of large raptors should also be considered in terms of an ecological land use planning. Co-operations: national and international co-operations were considered favourable and important, as for instance the International Colour-ringing Pro, gramme, transnational surveys (e.g. synchronous winter censuses) and habitat protection in terms of a meta-population concept, joint public relation activities (e.g. concerning poisoning incidents) and regular international conferences or) the White-tailed Eagle. Disturbance/nest protection: despite the general approach, the discussion focused mainly on the topic of nest site protection. Its realization was considered markedly difficult due to various reasons (circumstances of land ownership, hunting legislations, lacking enforcement of existing laws etc.).

The aims were to describe the colonization patterns of benthic assemblages on the two artificial modules, to highlight possible differences between them and to detect the effectiveness of the artificial reef on the ecosystem functioning.The composition of the benthic communities settled on the two types of artificial substrates was different especially just after the reef deployment. Abundance and species richness were higher on PL in the first two years, while an explosion of individuals characterized PY in the third year. This suggested a delay of about one year in the colonization processes on PY likely due to the material and shape. The community settled of the artificial structures was dominated by hard-substrate species which are commonly absent in the natural environment. The occurrence of these organisms enriched the local soft-bottom communities and contributed to habitat diversification.

For years, the ecology of artificial structures has been investigated mainly in contrast to natural coastal habitats. However, it is increasingly emerging that structuring processes, such as trophic interactions, can depend on properties of the surrounding landscape. Heterogeneity of coastal seafloor and habitats could thus play a major role in determining the variability of ecological outcomes on artificial structures. Artificial reefs are being used in coastal areas in attempts to restore and enhance marine habitats and communities, including large brown seaweed (kelp), to offset habitat loss and mitigate coastal development impacts. The outcome of enhancement projects using artificial reefs have not always been either consistent or positive. Overlooking the effect of strong ecological interactions adds a high level of uncertainty and can undermine the success of these efforts. In Eastern Canada, top-down control exerted by green sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) can seriously compromise the success of artificial reefs for kelp enhancement. Importantly, urchin interactions with macroalgae are likely to be influenced by the bottom composition. A seascape approach could thus integrate behavior and habitat heterogeneity. C_LIO_LIWe investigated whether the local seascape could create zones of differential grazing risk for kelp outplanting kelp (Alaria esculenta) on artificial blocks on an heterogenous bottom. Adopting a spatially explicit framework, we determined how seascape affected the urchin use of the habitat and used this information to map the grazing risk throughout the area. C_LIO_LIKelp survival was a function of frequency of urchin presence throughout the study site. While urchins avoided sandy patches, bottom composition and algal cover modulated the within-patch urchin use of the habitat. This translated in the heterogeneity of grazing risk intensity. C_LIO_LISynthesis and applications. The presence of discrete seascape features locally increased the grazing risk for kelp by differentially affecting the urchins usage of the habitat, even within the same bottom patch. Incorporating this information when planning artificial reefs could minimize the detrimental grazing risk thus increasing the rate of success and ensuring lasting results.

In such deep waters, the design of the turbine, as well as the anchoring system shall have special features so that existing ocean engineering technologies can be applied and the engineering cost can be lowered. Thus, as regards design, in addition to the analysis of the interaction between turbine and current, priority shall also be given to the design of the anchoring system of the turbine. To address the concerns, the authors propose an ocean turbine featured as follows: (1) it can be anchored in deep waters with a single cable; (2) it can generate high power in a current of moderate flow speed while producing low drag; (3) it can be self-balanced against current disturbance; (4) it is shrouded to enhance power efficiency; (5) the dynamic variations due to the interaction between the turbine and current are small. All of these features are confirmed with the computational results, leading to a detailed design of the turbine structure. If the easy-to-install high-efficiency shrouded turbines, having the capability to self-balance and requiring minimum maintenance effort, are successfully developed, the power supply pressure in Taiwan can be greatly alleviated.

Prior to an accident, tubular structural members will be carrying their normal operational loads. It is very important that this service load (pre-loading) is considered when the effect of impact damage is going to be estimated.This paper describes the experimental studies in which axially pre-loaded tubes were examined under lateral dynamic impact loads. The tubes were impacted by a dropped object with a velocity of about 7 m/s at their mid-span. The experimental investigation was aimed at gaining an insight and understanding of the dynamic failure and behaviour of the impacted tubes and to provide bench-marking data on the response of axially loaded steel tubes subjected to lateral impact.The main advantage of the current investigation, compared with those carried out previously and reported in the literature, is that both pre-loading and dynamic effects are included in the study.

Artificial structures have become ubiquitous features of coastal landscapes. Although they provide novel habitats for the colonization of marine organisms, their role in facilitating biological invasions has been largely unexplored.2. We investigated the distribution and dynamics of the introduced green alga, Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides, at a variety of spatial scales on breakwaters in the north Adriatic Sea, and analysed experimentally the mechanisms underlying its establishment. We assessed the provision of sheltered habitats by breakwaters, the role of disturbance (e.g. from recreational harvesting and storms) acting at different times of the year, and the interactions between Codium and the dominant native space-occupier, the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis.3. Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides has established viable populations on artificial structures along the shores investigated. The density, cover and size (length, branching and weight) of annual erect thalli of Codium was enhanced in sheltered conditions, resulting in the monopolization of landward low-shore habitats of breakwaters.4. On the landward sides of breakwaters, disturbance enhanced recruitment of Codium. The time when bare space was provided within mussels beds was crucial. Removal of mussels in April or January did not affect the recruitment of Codium, whereas harvest in August, shortly before Codium gamete release, doubled its success. On the seaward sides of breakwaters, the effects of disturbance were more complex because mussels both inhibited recruitment of Codium and provided shelter from wave action to adult thalli.5. Synthesis and applications. Artificial structures can provide suitable habitats for non-indigenous marine species and function as corridors for their expansion. Physical (wave exposure) and biotic (resident assemblages) features of artificial habitats can be important determinants of their susceptibility to biological invasions. Alternative options in the design of artificial structures and effective management of native assemblages could minimize their role in biological invasions. In particular, increased water motion and retention of space by mussels in spring-summer would be effective in reducing the ability of C. fragile ssp. tomentosoides to persist on the breakwaters investigated in this study.",,,,,,,,,259,1,0,0,227,4,268,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bologna, Ctr Interdipartimentale Ric Sci Ambientali Ravenn, I-48100 Ravenna, ItalyUniv Bologna, Dipartimento Biol Evoluzionist & Sperimentale, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",,,,2005-12-01,WOS:000233515200007,,

This paper proposes a practical method for the estimation of (i) the extreme response statistics and (ii) the probability of failure of dynamically sensitive offshore structures in a given sea-state. The proposed method accounts for the random nature of a sea-state by the structured use of multiple Constrained NewWaves in combination with the Monte Carlo method.

Nevertheless, many salt marshes face severe erosion. There is a consensus that providing structures that create sheltered conditions from high energetic conditions can improve the potential for salt marsh growth. However, little proof is provided on the explicit influence of structures to promote salt marsh growth. This paper investigates how artificial structures can be used to steer the morphological development of salt marshes. A morphological model (Delft3D Flexible Mesh) was applied, which enabled the analysis of various artificial structures with realistic representation. A salt marsh in the Wadden Sea which has seen heavy erosion (lateral retreat rate of 0.9 m/year) served as case study. We simulate both daily and storm conditions. Hereby, vegetation is represented by an increased bed roughness. The model is able to simulate the governing processes of salt marsh development. Results show that, without artificial structures, erosion of the salt marsh and tidal flat continues. With structures implemented, results indicate that there is potential for salt marsh growth in the study area. Moreover, traditional structures, which were widely implemented in the past, proved to be most effective to stimulate marsh growth. More broadly, the paper indicates how morphological development of a salt marsh can be steered by various configurations of artificial structures.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,6,0,15,,,,2077-1312,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Twente, Water Engn & Management, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, NetherlandsHKV Consultants, POB 2120, NL-8203 AC Lelystad, Netherlands",HKV Consultants,,,2020-06-22,WOS:000539274600027,,

In these applications the robustness of the electronics and the reliability of the packaging technology are key factors. Reliability requirements are for electronic modules are derived from environmental and operational loads. This leads to general requirements for the system concept to ensure their operation and thus system reliability. Most frequently the focus is set on thermomechanical design issues. The presented work however includes, investigations for a different loading scenario- long-term use under constant media exposure in a maritime environment in seawater. The application scenario is monitoring of the foundation structure for offshore wind turbines. Specific requirements to protect the sensors and sensor electronics from the surrounding medium sea-water and permanent pressure load of 3 to 6 bar in the application of water depth between 20 to 50 meters. Other environmental conditions are occurring minerals and microorganisms which can attack the package system in long term. The permanent installation of electronics requires a system design with lifetimes in the range of the test structure itself, which is set to 10 years.The presented work include characterizations of organic potting compounds for this purpose. Emphasis has been put into the materials resistances to media absorption and diffusion properties. Furthermore, aging effects in sea water and fuel mix and their impact towards mechanical stability of the polymer systems are presented. These include displacements of the characteristic glass transition and the variation of the elastic modulus.Unfilled epoxy material has been successfully modified to achieve increased media resistance. Higher polymer cross linking has been shown to increase resistance. Dynamic mechanical measurements have shown, that aging causes softening of material and shift of glass transition towards lower temperatures. The general tendency polar polymers are degrading in polar solvents (EP and PUR) according to contained molecular group. Ester group in basic medium, ether in acid medium. Other properties strongly depend on the individual recipe of the polymer product (e.g. hardener system). The investigated polyurethane has shown to be only conditionally useful for encapsulation. Comparatively the PCB materials have shown very good media resistance properties. Overall a full protection with polymer is hardly possible and measures to adjust layout component placement and pcb design are to be done also to ensure longtime reliability. As potential life-reducing mechanisms unwanted material changes through media storage and path formation within the polymer system have been identified. Possible starting areas for crack initiations have to be minimized. This means the reduction of air inclusions or de lamination potential at interfaces. Based on the results, it is possible to counteract the formation of cracks in encapsulations and select suitable encapsulation materials to effectively resist the diffusion of the medium and constant pressure.

Unlike the previous studies in which the pile-soil interface is assumed to be non-slip condition (conode pile-soil interface model), a static Coulomb friction contact is adopted to simulate the pile-soil interaction. The results reveal that the pile-soil sliding takes place under the dynamic wave loading. The effect of nonlinear pile-soil contact on pore pressure response is insignificant, whereas the seabed displacement and pile behavior are remarkably influenced in comparison with the conode pile-soil interface model.

Computation results show that the developed numerical model is capable of capturing a variety of nonlinear phenomena in the interaction process between offshore structures and their loose seabed foundation. Under seismic loading, the loose seabed foundation away from the composite breakwater becomes completely liquefied. Because of the presence of the structure, the seabed foundation beneath the composite breakwater is partially liquefied. The composite breakwater undergoes significant subsidence, translation, and rotation; meanwhile, large lateral spreading occurs in the sloping seabed foundation.

In order to assess the impact of additional mortalities on birds, both the number of birds killed and their ability to sustain those deaths must be estimated. Niel and Lebreton [Niel, C., Lebreton, J.-D., 2005. Using demographic invariants to detect overharvested bird populations from incomplete data. Conservation Biology 19, 826-835] applied a simple decision rule [Wade, P.R., 1998. Calculating limits to the allowable human-caused mortality of cetaceans and pinnipeds. Marine Mammal Science 14, 1-37] to estimate the level of additional human-caused mortality or potential biological removal (PBR) that can be sustained for bird species given only (1) estimates of the population size, adult survival, and age at first breeding, and (2) the current population status and management goals. We provide guidelines for appropriate use of the method and case studies comparing results from this method to other approaches. Particular focus is placed on applying the method to Procellariiformes. PBR limits may then be set without a population model and when monitoring levels are minimal, and in a computationally straightforward manner. While this approach has many advantages, there are limitations. The PBR rule was initially developed for cetaceans and pinnipeds and there have been no adaptations for the unique biology of birds which may need further consideration. Additionally, because this is a simplifying method that ignores differences in life stages, it may not be appropriate for very small populations or for those listed as 'critically endangered', and further work is needed for situations where mortalities have large gender or age bias.

In Sydney Harbour (NSW, Australia), intertidal seawalls replace considerable portions of natural habitats, including rocky shores. Previous studies have shown that seawalls and rocky shores generally support similar assemblages of plants and animals, with important differences in relative abundances of some species. The behaviour of key consumers can have a fundamental role in structuring benthic assemblages, and it is, therefore, necessary to assess whether it is changed by the replacement of natural habitats with artificial structures. This study compares patterns of movement of the common patellid limpet Cellana tramoserica between seawalls and vertical rocky shores. The distances displaced, the orientation of movement and the homing behaviour of marked individuals were recorded from day to day, over a period of several tidal cycles (14 d) and for a longer period (ca. 3 mo), on several seawalls and rocky shores. Short-term patterns of movement (1 to 14 d) did not differ between structures. In contrast, after 3 mo, although the orientation of the movement remained random on both kinds of structures, limpets on seawalls had dispersed longer distances and tended not to retain their original positions. These results suggest that long-term dispersal of C. tramoserica, rather than foraging bouts, could be altered by the replacement of rocky shores with artificial structures. Differences in use of habitat by key consumers should be incorporated in models aimed at identifying the mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of different assemblages on natural and artificial structures.",,,,,,,,,33,1,0,0,31,0,37,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bologna, I-48100 Ravenna, ItalyUniv Sydney, Marine Labs, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,,,2004-01-01,WOS:000225543400010,,

Corpses were identified to species and kinds of injury, ages, and fat and muscle scores were determined. Nocturnal bird calls were recorded, identified to species and quantified. Local and large-scale weather parameters were also considered.Results A total of 767 birds of 34 species, mainly thrushes, European Starlings and other passerines, were found at 45 visits. Most carcasses were in good body condition and young birds were not more affected than adults. Three quarters of 563 examined individuals had collision induced injuries. Birds in poor body condition were less likely to be collision victims than those in good condition. Mass collision events at the illuminated offshore structure coincided with increasingly adverse weather conditions and an increasing call intensity of nocturnal birds.Conclusions Assuming an average of 150 dead birds per year at this single offshore structure and additionally assuming that a considerable proportion of the corpses were not found, we estimate that mortality at the 1000 + human structures in the North Sea could reach hundreds of thousands of birds. Since offshore industrialization will progress and collision numbers at offshore turbines will consequently increase considerably, we recommend reinforced measures to reduce bird strikes at offshore structures, especially in the light of substantial declines in some migrant species.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,19,0,23,,,0006-3657,1944-6705,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Avian Res, Vogelwarte 21, Wilhelmshaven, GermanyAvitec Res, Sachsenring 11, D-27711 Osterholz Scharmbeck, Germany",Inst Avian ResAvitec Res,,,2016-04-06,WOS:000372039300009,,

We show that the method is very versatile, and yields accurate results for a wide range of pile geometries and soil stiffness profiles, over the full depth of the embedded pile. For the dynamic case, the discretized global stiffness kernels (matrices) become complex-valued (they include soil stiffness, inertia and damping), and the 1D model proves to be capable of mimicking also the out-of-phase part of the response. The method being straightforward and fast, the engineering community is served the benefits of accuracy (3D model) and speed (1D model), without the need of empiric tuning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The AR global ranking index (ARMI(r)) and AR local effect index (ARMI(e)) include 16 metrics that represent four broad levels of the fish community: structure of fish assemblages, trophic structure, vulnerability and economic importance. Individual metrics were evaluated using a long-term dataset of fish assemblages from the AR and CA in northern Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Bottom gillnets were used to sample the fish two times per year for 21 years after creating the reef. The ARMI(r) general score for the AR was 51 out of a possible 100, with scores varying from 38 to 54. The ARMI(r) general score for the CA was 39 out of 100, with scores varying from 35 to 47. Average ARMI(e) values were 12% higher for the AR in relation to the CA. Spatial-temporal comparisons of the ARMI(r) using generalized additive models revealed significant differences between AR and CA. Evaluations of the ARMI(e) scores revealed that the assemblage structure and economic importance level significantly increased over time in the AR.

Virtual sensing technologies have the potential to alleviate such difficulties by estimating the unmeasured structural responses at the desired locations using other measured responses. Despite the usefulness of virtual sensing, its performance and applicability to the structural health monitoring of offshore structures have not been fully studied to date. This study investigates the use of virtual sensing of offshore structures. A Kalman filter based virtual sensing algorithm is developed to estimate responses at the location of interest. Further, this algorithm performs a multi-sensor data fusion to improve the estimation accuracy under non-stationary tidal loading.

Habitat preferences of males and females, and individuals <1 m and >1 m, did not differ. Orectolobus ornatus selected daytime resting positions with a high topographic complexity and crevice volume and did not select on the basis of prey availability.

Seven individuals exhibited short-term temporary fidelity to the study area; they were resighted frequently for part of an intensive 100-day survey. Remaining individuals were temporary visitors; they were resighted at most once after initial identification or returning after extended absences.

As a new form of multi-level energy complimentary utilization, integrated energy systems are attracting more and more attention for their high-efficiency and low-cost. However, due to the deep coupling relationship between systems, they are more susceptible to natural disasters, resulting in a cascading failure. To enhance the resilience of the integrated electricity-gas system, this paper proposes a failure restoration strategy after a natural disaster occurs. First, the temporal constraints of the dispatching model are considered, and the failure restoration problem is molded into a multi-period mixed-integer linear programme, aiming to recover the interrupted loads as much as possible. Second, since the uncertain output of distributed generation sources (DGs) such as wind turbines and photovoltaic systems will threat the reliability of restoration results, the robust formulation model is incorporated to cope with this problem. Third, we propose a new modeling method for radial topology constraints towards failure restoration. Moreover, the Column and Constraints Generation (C&CG) decomposition method is utilized to solve the robust model. Then, the piecewise linearization technique and the linear DistFlow equations are utilized to eliminate the nonlinear terms, providing a model that could be easily solved by an off-shelf commercial solver. The obtained results include the sequence of line/pipeline switchgear actions, the time-series dispatching results of electricity storage system, gas storage system, and the coupling devices including the gas-fired turbine, power to gas equipment. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed restoration strategy is verified by numerical simulation on a 13-6 node integrated energy system.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Zhejiang Univ, Coll Elect Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,,,2019-12-12,WOS:000498072600084,,

This code is relatively advanced in its application of limit states design to offshore structures. The part dealing with foundations is written as a performance standard. It does not specify resistance factors (or safety factors) to achieve the target reliability of the structure. Although limit states design is common practice among geotechnical engineers, the application of resistance factors is a problem. This paper describes some of the studies and conclusions reached by the Technical Committee in the development of the CSA foundations standard. As a first step, resistance factors were developed by calibration to conventional total factors of safety for the failure mechanisms considered. This approach has severe limitations. In particular, the applicability of safety factors developed for onshore practice or other offshore areas to the ice-dominated environment of Canadian offshore regions is questionable. In addition, many offshore structure designs include consideration of dynamic loading and scour or erosion problems that cannot be satisfactorily dealt with using factors of safety. An example of the problem of applying separate load and resistance factors for a bearing-capacity problem is given to show that load and resistance are not independent of each other. Because of the problems with development of resistance factors, the CSA foundations standard dictates that offshore structure designs include a risk analysis of the foundation system.

Efforts to develop ecological engineering solutions that offset these negative consequences on biodiversity while retaining engineering function abound, but to date few studies have investigated the role of multiple factors simultaneously driving patterns of biotic colonisation. Here, the role of surface heterogeneity, chemical composition and surface orientation was evaluated over a 6-month period. An increase in habitat heterogeneity, the replacement of shale for ground oyster shell (cue) and downward orientation was predicted to increase species richness, diversity and abundance. Orientation and heterogeneity greatly affected species richness, abundance, and community composition, and the inclusion of ground oyster shell (cue) increased bivalve recruitment but had only a marginal effect on community structure. Community formation was facilitated by low light but inhibited by sedimentation. On upward-facing surfaces, sediment accumulation on high complexity surfaces expanded niche heterogeneity, and supported communities comprised of burrowing polychaetes and predatory species. Surface orientation and heterogeneity are key factors influencing larval recruitment, and in supporting diverse benthic assemblages on artificial structures.

This paper attempts to ascertain what are the major challenges of the company specific HSE standards, why does the offshore wind industry need a standardized HSE management system and who can play the key role in this process? To achieve these objectives, this research applies the interview and survey techniques. The research identified several key challenges such as gaps in coordination and communication among the stakeholders, gaps in incident reporting systems and the absence of a common HSE standard to overcome these challenges. Seven stakeholders were identified who can influence the development process of a harmonized HSE management system. However, the operators and turbine manufacturers are the key stakeholders to play role in this development process. The results of this study provide the top management to understand the problems associated with the current un-harmonized company specific HSE management systems and how to address these problems by creating a common HSE management standard to achieve the goal of 'zero accidents'.

To reach the given target a huge growth in renewable energy is necessary. One of the most potential possibilities to produce renewable energy in Germany will be the installation of offshore wind turbines.During the installation of offshore wind foundations such as monopiles, tripods, tripiles and jackets, mostly large tubular steel piles are impact driven to final penetration depth. In the process of impact driving, considerable underwater sound emissions will appear. In recent times, peak sound pressure levels above 190 dB re 1 mu Pa have been measured at a distance of 750 m away from the installation ground. These peak sound pressure levels, produced during the installation of any kind of driven offshore foundation, is potentially harmful to marine life, in particular to marine mammals such as harbor porpoises, harbor seals or grey seals.To protect the marine life the German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) set the maximum allowed underwater sound pressure level to 160 dB (SEL) at a distance of 750 m away from pile driving.To reach the given target by the BSH a new underwater piling noise mitigation system using so called hydro sound dampers (HSD) is presently developed at the Institute for Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering at the Technische Universitat in Braunschweig (IGB-TUBS). After small scale tests in the so called 'large wave channel' in Hannover a full scale test was performed in the Baltic-Sea some weeks ago.The results of the measurements are very promising, as a reduction of 12 up to 20 dB could be generated. Besides existing noise mitigation systems one of the main advantage of the hydro sound dampers is, that the mitigation can be pre-adjusted to a predefined frequency range, as marine mammals are sensitive only for a certain sound frequency range.In this paper, the results of the small and large scale tests and some new research findings concerning the shape and the material of the hydro sound dampers will be presented.",,,,,"31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUL 01-06, 2012JUL 01-06, 2012","Petrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivPetrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4491-5,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Soil Mech & Fdn Engn, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany",,,,2013-11-14,WOS:000324655900023,,

Preliminary evidence indicates that decommissioned rigs in shallower waters can also help rebuild declining fish stocks. Conversely, potential negative impacts include physical damage to existing benthic habitats within the drop zone, undesired changes in marine food webs, facilitation of the spread of invasive species, and release of contaminants as rigs corrode.

We exposed heaps of the macroalgae, Ulva lactuca, to natural grazing, at various distances from three artificial reefs. Results suggest that artificial reefs change grazing patterns in the neighboring area. In all the locations examined grazing was 2-3 times higher near the artificial reefs than in control sites (p < 0.05). We suggest that herbivorous fishes are attracted to the artificial reefs, creating a zone of increased grazing. Therefore, while planning deployment of such artificial reefs it is necessary to consider their overall influence on their natural surroundings, in order to maintain the natural community trophic dynamics.

Usually, several options will be examined and run through a Comparative Assessment before a final selection. There is also the need to keep stakeholders informed as the project proposals develop. Many of the issues require complex scientific or engineering studies and risk assessments frequently outsourced to contractors. The information in their reports feeds the Comparative Assessment. However, it may be difficult for stakeholders, or even the regulating agency, to judge the veracity of such technically complex issues and feel confident that the evidence for the final project proposal is soundly based. Failure to adequately exchange information has led to open confrontation in the past. An approach which can provide greater transparency and confidence in the outcome is to set up a review group of independent professionals with wide expertise at the outset of a project.

Most of the offshore structures shall be operated over 20 years under the harsh environments at sites so that the offshore structures should be designed to endure the harsh environments.In this study, the effect of the impact load (so called slapping load) by the steep waves acting on the FPSO bow is investigated through the model test. For measurement of the impact pressures on the frontal area, a bow-shaped panel was fabricated, and installed the pressure sensors on the bow starboard side of the model FPSO. During the model test campaign, the impact load was investigated using the steep waves with Hs/lambda greater than 1/16 of the representative wave condition.Consequently, it is confirmed through the model test that the impact loads acting on the FPSO bow are significantly increased with the steep waves (Hs/lambda > 1/16) than the representative wave conditions of a maximum significant wave height and a pitch forcing period. Therefore, for safe design of North Sea FPSO, it is necessary to consider the steep waves in addition to the representative wave conditions and to be applied as proper structural load. Also, the effect of random seeds in irregular waves should be considered to build the safe FPSO.

Offshore O&M is limited by strict wave height thresholds at the offshore point of operations (typically 1.5m) and with the UK set to spend £2bn per annum by 2025 on O&M for the offshore wind industry alone the prediction of viable working windows for O&M is critical. In the tidal stream MRE sector the combined forces of waves and tidal currents on underwater tidal turbines can lead to dangerously high physical and electrical loads placed on equipment and infrastructure. Poor knowledge, and thus prediction of the local variability in weather, wave and tide conditions result in conservative thresholds for MRE operations. This, in turn, reduces the time MRE devices are in operation (and therefore energy generation), increasing investor risk and harming the financial development of the MRE sector as a whole.Existing wave and current monitoring and forecasting technologies rely on expensive in-situ measurements of the marine environment (e.g., floating wave buoys and devices on the sea bed) and models driven by these measurements or other large-scale simulations. Although very precise, the project partners have identified traditional wave and current monitoring techniques to be inadequate in terms of spatial coverage, timeliness and accuracy in complicated, high-energy coastal environments. These environments have previously proven to be difficult for wave and current observation and validation due to high equipment costs and risks of failure. As such there is a paucity of reliable, large-scale measurements of waves and currents in these high-energy marine environments.Marine navigational radar ('X-band') is a mature technology for the remote sensing of the marine environment, capable of generating estimates of tidal current speed, ocean wave parameters and water depths over wide areas. However the current state-of-the-art in X-band radar oceanography has been found lacking in the high-energy, dynamic and complicated coastal environments that marine energy projects are operating. This project aims to develop a step-change in the way we process radar data to generate measurements of the marine environment, paving the way for a system that can produce the environmental information the marine industry requires. NOC has a 20 year history at the forefront of marine radar oceanography and is well-placed to deliver this much needed development.To achieve this aim an open-source wave model will be integrated with the NOC's tried-and-tested radar analysis toolbox to produce a hybrid model/observation system. This system will combine modelled and observed wave information in such a way that minimises the errors in both; effectively generating a 'most likely' wave measurement over wider area every 10-15 minutes in near-real-time. The system will be developed using radar data and validated using ground-truth data recorded at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) on Orkney; the world's largest and most successful MRE test facility. Once validated, the system will then be demonstrated in a real-world setting at the OpenHydro test platform at EMEC.This project includes researchers with expertise radar oceanography, marine observation and the numerical modelling of the marine environment. Our project partners include EMEC, the marine energy company OpenHydro and JBA consulting; a company at the cutting-edge of operational forecasting. This new and innovative environmental monitoring system will be developed with the guidance of our partners and the successful system used to supply the basis for high-impact solutions for the partners and their clients.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/R014779/1,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15391493,,

Breakwaters can alter habitats by undermining shallow coastal ecosystems, especially coral reefs. However, recent studies indicate that mature breakwaters can have well-developed corals and coral-associated fishes. Breakwaters with colonized corals may act as surrogates of natural coral reefs against the global coral crisis. Here, we examined the composition of corals, fishes, and benthic biota/abiota between natural reefs and mature breakwaters to evaluate the possibility of breakwaters supplementing natural reefs. We found equal or higher coral cover, fish abundance, and species richness on breakwaters. Conversely, differential coral growth forms and fish assemblages on mature breakwaters suggested the irreplaceability of natural reefs. Corals and coral reef fishes on mature man-made structures, however, may improve the resistance and resilience of coral reefs. Conclusively, despite high coral cover on mature man-made structures appropriate management (e.g., marine reserves) is still necessary to sustain the coral reefs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The approach allows links between elements of the target of analyses and the related parts of the risk model to be explicitly captured, which facilitates tool support for identifying the parts of a risk model that need to be reconsidered when a change is made to the target.

Slightly behind the PRC were the British Virgin Islands (BVI) which had received FDI inflows of US$ 92 billion, making the BVI fourth in the world. It is noteworthy that not only are the PRC and the BVI among the top four recipients of FDI, there is also a strong relationship between the two jurisdictions in terms of FDI flows. For instance, the BVI is frequently cited as one of the top three sources of FDI into the PRC (together with the Cayman Islands (Cayman) and Hong Kong). In 2010, the BVI was the second-largest investor in the PRC, providing US$10.4 billion (9.1%) of total inward FDI into the PRC.The question then arises as to why a small island located in the Caribbean should be both a significant recipient of global FDI and a leading contributor of FDI into the PRC. This paper will look at the reasons behind this phenomenon, by examining the role of the BVI in structuring inward investment into the PRC and considering how the BVI is used to structure outward investment by PRC enterprises. This paper will also consider other offshore jurisdictions, as well as the role of Hong Kong and Macau (which are often considered to be quasi-offshore jurisdictions) in Chinese FDI. This article will focus on the use of offshore jurisdictions from a legal perspective and consider the interplay of offshore structures with PRC law. This paper is divided into seven parts. Part I provides an overall introduction. Part II examines key definitions and perspectives. Part III looks at the economic development of the PRC and the context in which the use of offshore structures has emerged.

The perhaps most common application of environmental contours is for wave climate variables such as significant wave height and wave period. However, for the design of wind energy installations, the joint distribution of wind speed and wind direction may be equally important. In this case, joint modelling of linear (wind speed) and circular (wind direction) variables are needed, and methods for establishing environmental contours for circular-linear variables will be required. In this paper, different ways of establishing environmental contours for circular-linear variables will be presented and applied to a joint distribution model for wind speed and wind direction. In particular, the direct sampling approach to environmental contours will be modified to the case where one of the variables is cyclic.

This article extends a newly proposed method 111 to manage the non-zero initial conditions of offshore structures in the frequency domain, including new studies on original environmental loads reconstruction, response comparisons with the commercial software ANSYS, and a demonstration using an experimental cantilever beam. The original environmental loads, such as waves, currents, and winds, that act on a structure are decomposed into multiple complex exponential components are represented by a series of poles and corresponding residues. Counter to the traditional frequency-domain method, the non-zero initial conditions of offshore structures could be solved in the frequency domain. Compared with reference [1], an improvement reported in this article is that practical issues, including the choice of model order and central-processing-unit (CPU) time consumption, are further studied when applying this new method to offshore structures. To investigate the feasibility of the representation of initial environmental loads by their poles and corresponding residues, a measured random wave force collected from a column experiment at the Lab of Ocean University of China is used, decomposed, reconstructed and then compared with the original wave force; then, a numerical offshore platform is used to study the performance of the proposed method in detail. The numerical results of this study indicate that (1) a short duration of environmental loads are required to obtain their constitutive poles and residues, which implies good computational efficiency; and (2) the proposed method has a similar computational efficiency to traditional methods due to the use of the inverse Fourier transform technique. To better understand the performance, of time consumption and accuracy of the proposed method, the commercial software ANSYS is used to determine responses from the time history analysis. Comparisons of the results between the proposed method and the ANSYS results demonstrate that the proposed method produces high accuracies that are similar to the time-domain method and good computational efficiencies, which are similar to the traditional frequency-domain method. Finally, a steel cantilever beam is used to demonstrate the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Transmission and distribution assets comprised of power lines, cables, transformers, substations and other electrical equipment generate a wide range of environmental impacts. Throughout the lifetime of the equipment, the impacts originate mainly from power losses during the use phase, but other life cycle stages such as installation, maintenance and dismantling also contribute significantly to some impact categories. In this paper, the environmental impacts of the Norwegian transmission grid are assessed. The methodology used here is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with ReCiPe as impact assessment method. In total, 11,097 km of lines and cables, 345 transformers and 121 substations were installed in the Norwegian transmission grid by the end of 2009; the network also included some hundreds of kilometers of sea cables between Norway and abroad. The results show that for each kW h of electricity transmitted in Norway, climate change impacts are of 1.3-1.5 g CO2 eq., assuming a Norwegian electricity mix. Half of these emissions are associated with power losses, and the other half with infrastructure processes such as materials production, installation, maintenance, and end-of-life. The results also show that after the losses, the infrastructure processes for overhead lines and transformers, and the emissions of SF6 from Gas Insulated equipment are the most relevant contributors for total climate impacts. A sensitivity analysis is done with respect to the electricity mix used to model power losses in the system. The results show that the contribution of power losses to the total climate change scores increases to 84% and 94%, by replacing the Norwegian mix by the Nordic mix and the European mix, respectively.

The harbor and offshore structures made of steel piles or sheet piles as components are easily to be corroded because oxygen is smoothly supplied through the thin water films formed by seawater splash. In particular, the supply of dissolved oxygen becomes easier and reaction rate is enhanced as the flow rate increases; as a result, corrosion rates increase. In addition, in marine environments, the seawater flows resulting from the difference between the rise and fall of the tides and ocean currents caused by topographical effects affect the corrosion characteristics of offshore structures. Therefore, in the present study, flow fields were analyzed in the seawater environments through particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurement; the electrochemical characteristics of S355ML steel were evaluated and the corrosion trend of this steel with changes in flow rate was analyzed as well.

However, the process of migration is a source of risk for migratory species as human actions increasingly destroy and fragment habitat, create obstacles to migration, and increase mortality along the migration corridor. As a result, many migratory species are declining in numbers. In the United States, the Endangered Species Act provides some protection against extinction for such species, but no protection until numbers are severely reduced, and no guarantee of recovery to population levels associated with cultural, ecological, or economic significance. Although groups of species receive some protection from statutes such as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act, there is no coordinated system for conservation of migratory species. In addition, information needed to protect migratory species is often lacking, limiting options for land and wildlife managers who seek to support these species. In this Article, we outline the existing scientific, legal, and management information and approaches to migratory species. Our objective is to assess present capacity to protect the species and the phenomenon of migration, and we argue that al three disciplines are necessary for effective conservation. We find significant capacity to support conservation in all three disciplines, but no organization around conservation of migration within any discipline or among the three disciplines. Areas of synergy exist among the disciplines but not as a result of any attempt for coordination. As a result, significant gaps in information and capacity exist that must be addressed if effective conservation of migratory species is to be undertaken. We suggest that all three disciplines cooperate to identify the most pressing research needs, so that these can become targets for relevant funding sources. We identify areas of current risk to migratory species that represent gaps in current legal protections: protective legislation that provides no guidelines for desirable population sizes or best management practices for migratory species, taxonomic groups, particularly those including long-distance migrants, for which no agency has oversight, and gaps in policies to address impacts of fragmentation and obstacles such as power lines and wind turbines that curtail migration or cause mortality. Finally, we suggest that state-level programs provide either a foundation to augment with, or a model on which to build, conservation efforts targeting migratory species. Problems will arise due to lack of funds, difficulties in securing a landscape that will support abundant migrations, lack of adequate standards and best management practices, and an insufficient culture of collaboration among the three main relevant disciplines. However, we view these problems as entirely soluble and see evidence of support in society at large for conservation of migratory species.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,7,1,14,,,0046-2276,,,,,,,,,,,"Associate Professor, School of Public and Environmental Affairs (SPEA), and affiliated Associate Professor of Law, Indiana University Maurer School of Law, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana.

This is to enable both spatial planning and where necessary mitigation in an increasingly crowded marine environment. One approach to mitigation is co-location of OWFs and marine protected areas (MPAs). This systematic review has the objective to inform this co-location proposal and identify areas requiring further research. A limited number of studies addressing marine renewable energy structures and related artificial structures in coastal waters were found. The results of these studies display a change in species assemblages at artificial structures in comparison to naturally occurring habitats. An increase in hard substrata associated species, especially benthic bivalves, crustaceans and reef associated fish and a decrease in algae abundance were the dominant trends. Assemblages associated with complex concrete structures revealed greater similarity to natural hard substrata compared to those around steel structures. To consider marine renewable energy sites, especially large scale OWFs as MPAs, the dissimilar nature of assemblages on the structures themselves to natural communities should be considered. However positive effects were recorded on the abundance of commercially important crustacean species. This suggests potential for incorporation of OWFs as no fishing, or restricted activity zones within a wider MPA to aid fisheries augmentation. The limited available evidence highlights a requirement for significant further research involving long term monitoring at a variety of sites to better inform management options.

The stiffness of the foundation structure has a high impact on the fundamental structural resonance and on the inclination (tilt) of the complete structure. A potential degradation of any such stiffness might move the fundamental resonance frequencies closer to the first harmonic of the rotor rotation frequency resulting in increased dynamic loads. Continuous identification of the foundation stiffness and the inclination together with the fundamental resonance frequencies were therefore considered the primary monitoring goals.The foundation stiffness is defined by the ratio of the bending moments and shear forces with respect to the inclination at TP-airtight platform level. The bending moments and shear forces were calculated from the strains measured in three directions at five locations along the TP-circumference. The inclinations were measured by a 2-axial inclination sensor located at the same TP level. The bending moments and shear forces were correlated with the inclinations and also with the environmental and operational (EO) data (wind velocity, rotor frequency, nacelle orientation and generated power). The state indicators are based on two different data sets: (a) the long-term distribution of the 10-minute averages and (b) the time histories of the strain and inclination data which are measured with a sampling rate of 50 Hz. The time histories were used for extracting the fundamental bending frequencies continuously over the monitoring period via time-frequency analysis based on 5-minute time intervals. Operational modal analysis (OMA) techniques were applied to the data of each interval.The measurement system (MPC-system) designed by the University of Kassel was installed on the TP airtight platform and connected via internet to the university lab-PC. The raw test data are stored locally by the MPC-system and can be downloaded to the lab-PC on demand for data evaluation.Results from continuous monitoring over a period of 20 months show the evolution (trend) of the derived state indicators.

This issue has been investigated mostly for mildly sloping (<5 degrees) seabed considering uncoupled or one-way coupled response of wave and seabed interaction. However, some of the marine structures are founded on seabed with steeper slopes. In this study, the wave-induced response and instability of sloping seabed are evaluated using a coupled finite element model. The interaction between fluid and porous seabed accounting for the effect of fluid motion on the seabed response, and conversely the effect of seabed response on the fluid motion (but not on the surface wave profile) is considered. The results indicate that the system response (fluid pressure, stresses, etc.) and the extent of instantaneously liquefied zone within the sloping seabed with significant steepness are lesser than those for horizontal seabed. Moreover, for typical sediment and wave characteristics, for the flat seabed, the response obtained from fully coupled analysis is not significantly different from those obtained by uncoupled analysis. For the sloping bed, such difference is slightly greater as compared to that for the flat bed.",,,,,,,,,16,2,0,0,0,0,18,,,0141-1187,1879-1549,,,,,,,,,,"Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 2501 Stinson Dr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn,,,2019-07-09,WOS:000472243300010,,

The foundations of such structures are towed to sites where they are flooded and installed directly on sea bed. During operation of offshore structures the sea bed soil around and beneath the structure foundations are exposed to external effects such as sea currents, waves and also propeller streams generated by ships approaching the structures. As a result the soil is washed out from under the structure which may cause reduction of bearing surface area and even lead to loss of stability of the structure on seabed.The model studies on soil erosion process near foundations of gravitational-type offshore platforms have been conducted at Krylov's shallow water towing tank since 2000. This towing tank was not originally intended for such experiments, and, therefore, special experimental equipment has been developed for this purpose. These include a sandy bottom, current generation arrangements in the model test zone, instrumentation for measuring the bottom profile. Also specific model test procedures and methods for research on soil scour near the test objects have been developed and verified.The paper gives a review of these research studies at the Krylov Centre, describe the test equipment, modeling techniques and test data scaling procedures as well as the experience learned from the experiments.The paper gives some results of research studies of soil erosion near the foundations of offshore structures as a result of influence from sea currents and waves with coincident directions, and also as a result of influence from propeller streams of moored tankers and supply vessels.The paper presents the model test results regarding the efficiency of a mobile system developed for soil erosion protection near the offshore structure intended for exploratory drilling in shallow waters of the Gulf of Ob in the Kara Sea.A review of the recent Krylov's studies in this field of research is given.",,,,,"32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 09-14, 2013JUN 09-14, 2013","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Nantes, FRANCENantes, FRANCE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5540-9,,,,,,,,,"Krylov State Res Ctr, Offshore & Ocean Engn Res & Design Ctr, St Petersburg, Russia",,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000360867600037,,

These activities are compromised when coastlines erode. Coastal erosion is a global problem, given the number of places around the world where the coastline is receding. For the coast of Northeast Brazil, which is highly significant for tourism due to its beautiful beaches, native communities, holiday resorts, and residences, coastal erosion is a serious environmental, economic, and social problem. Hence, this phenomenon must be addressed through an understanding of the physical processes involved in the erosion in accordance with the environmental awareness of the stakeholders of the coastal zones. This way, a better appreciation of the human and environmental needs that constitute the local reality and a better comprehension of the values and expectations of society regarding economic, ethical, and aesthetic issues for protection of the environment can be achieved. The aim of this study was to diagnose the perception of the stakeholders regarding coastal erosion on a tourist beach in the northeast of Brazil. Located 74 km from the capital of the state Ceará, the Praia da Taiba is an approximately 10 km stretch of sandy beach, dunes, and sandstone reefs, with many cliffs and gullies formed by the tidal hydrodynamics. In recent decades, the region has experienced economic boom due to tourism, the establishment of a port and industrial pole (the Industrial and Port Complex of Pecém (CIPP) in 2002), and the construction of wind turbines (the Eolic Turbine Complex of Taiba in 1999). Data for the study was obtained using questionnaires specifically designed to reflect local reality. They were divided into the following parts: information about the interviewee, the ways people use the beach, and people's perception of the landscape. The results showed that the majority of the interviewees agreed that coastal erosion in the study area was caused by human activities, mainly related to the port complex of Pecém, over the last five years. Measures to contain coastal erosion were considered important in improving the socioeconomic state of the area. As a result, environmental awareness is relevant in studies of coastal erosion as a tool for planning and/or policies of public works that endeavor to improve beaches by controlling coastal erosion with the ultimate aim of contributing to socioeconomic and environmental development and the recuperation of tropical beaches.",,"A erosão costeira tem acarretado mudanças na paisagem de diversas praias, trazendo dificuldades para o desenvolvimento das atividades produtivas locais, como o turismo, a recreação e o comércio.

Five different types deep-water energy installations with depths ranging from 320 to 995 m, and three shipwrecks with depths ranging from approximately 530 to 615 m, were examined. Density, depth ranges, and growth rates of L. pertusa colonies were calculated from video and image analysis. L pertusa colonies were present on all structures examined. Minimum calculated growth rates for the largest colonies ranged from 0.32 to 3.23 cm/yr on the different structures. The shallowest depth at which L pertusa was observed was 201 m and the deepest was 801 m, considerably expanding the known depth range of this species in the northern GoM. Colony density varied with structure type, age, and depth, with the highest density between 503 and 518 m on the single structure that spanned the entire depth range of occurrence of L pertusa observed in this study. L pertusa colonies growing on thinner and deeper installations appear to have higher colonization rates, i.e. to develop higher densities over a shorter time period, compared to those on shallower and more massive types of installations. However, on average, colonies have slower growth rates on these installations than colonies on more massive, shallower installations (compliant and solid installations). In general, the calculated minimum growth rates were higher on the installations than on the shipwrecks, which were substantially older. A continuum of colony sizes was documented on all installations, suggesting multiple settlement events. L pertusa thickets were observed on the oldest anthropogenic structures, with most of the components of these structures covered by colonies of L pertusa. Brown, orange, and mottled color-variants were documented for the first time in the GoM. All installations examined for this study were colonized by L pertusa and it is likely that most artificial surfaces in appropriate depths in the GoM will be as well. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Strong currents interacting with man-made structures can generate complex three-dimensional wakes that can make prey more accessible. Whether localised wakes from man-made structures can generate predictable foraging hotspots for top predators is unknown. Here we address this question by quantifying the relative use of an anthropogenically-generated wake by surface foraging seabirds, verified using drone transects and hydroacoustics. We show that the wake of a tidal energy structure promotes a localised and persistent foraging hotspot, with seabird numbers greatly exceeding those at adjacent natural wake features. The wake mixes material throughout the water column, potentially acting like a prey conveyer belt. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying the physical scales and mechanisms underlying predator hotspot formation when assessing the ecological consequences of installing or removing anthropogenic structures.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,2399-3642,,,,,,,,,,"1School of Natural and Built Environment, Queen's University Marine Laboratory, 12-13 The Strand, Portaferry, BT22 1PF Northern Ireland UK.2Marine Institute, University of Plymouth, Drake Circus, Plymouth, PL4 8AA England UK.3School of Ocean Sciences, Bangor University, Menai Bridge, Anglesey, LL59 5AB Wales UK.",,,,2019-01-01,MEDLINE:30963112,30963112,

The tripod bore an upward looking Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and, on one deployment, a Modular Acoustic Velocity Sensor (MAVS) current meter 1.5m above the bottom. From burst measurements acquired every two hours by these two instruments, a pattern of tidally and wind-driven flow with vertical shear was captured. Measurements of near-bottom current and wave orbital motion with MAVS extended the ADCP measurements from near the surface to the bottom region where interaction with the sediment is episodically important. In the September-October, 2008 deployment, the net flow north of Naushon Island was out of Buzzards Bay in alignment with the mean alongshore wind, which was mostly northeast (out of the bay) during this period. The water leaving the bay near Naushon Island must be made up somewhere else in the bay. Upwelling is also the dominate process north of Naushon Island, even when the winds measured at buoy BUZM3 at the SW opening of Buzzards Bay are near zero velocity. Waves are short period, typically broadband but with a peak near 5 seconds, fetch limited but still restricted to the along axis direction in Buzzards Bay. The longest fetch is in the ENE direction and the greatest wave event was from that direction with a significant wave height of 1.3m and frequency of 0.2Hz, from a 16m/s NE wind. When conditions were calm, a consistent swell from the southwest of 22cm significant wave height and 14s period could be observed propagating in from the open Atlantic at the mouth of Buzzards Bay.It is common for the wind to reverse direction diurnally and the waves respond quite quickly to these reversals from into the bay to out of the bay. Since this is a typical summer and early fall pattern, models must represent this rapid wave response to wind forcing. The delay between the maximum wind and the maximum waves is as little as 14 hours. Extreme winter conditions are dominated by NE cyclonic storms and a deployment January 20, 2009 captured such strong NE winds. NW winds were a winter addition to the fall pattern and there were no strong SW winds in winter. A preliminary model was applied to the fall data from the tripod.In the coastal zone off Massachusetts, there is keen interest in power generation from wind turbines with our measurement site one of several under consideration. However, modeling of shallow-water, coastal response of current and wave to wind is useful for the other proposed sites as well as that north of Naushon Island. The development and validation of the model or models with these data will serve these alternate sites and should inform decision makers about environmental concerns at each site under consideration.",,,,,OCEANS 2009 - Europe ConferenceOCEANS 2009 - Europe Conference,"MAY 11-14, 2009MAY 11-14, 2009",IEEEIEEE,"Bremen, GERMANYBremen, GERMANY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4244-2522-8,,,,,,,,,"Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USASMAST U Mass Dartmouth, Dept Fisheries Oceanog, New Bedford, MA 02744 USA",SMAST U Mass Dartmouth,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000277066400163,,

Their existence in terrestrial systems has been documented, yet little evidence suggests they occur in marine environments. Coastal fish farms are widespread artificial structures in coastal ecosystems and are highly attractive to wild fish.Methodology/Principal Findings: To investigate if coastal salmon farms act as ecological traps for wild Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and saithe (Pollachius virens), we compared proxy measures of fitness between farm-associated fish and control fish caught distant from farms in nine locations throughout coastal Norway, the largest coastal fish farming industry in the world. Farms modified wild fish diets in both quality and quantity, thereby providing farm-associated wild fish with a strong trophic subsidy. This translated to greater somatic (saithe: 1.06-1.12 times; cod: 1.06-1.11 times) and liver condition indices (saithe: 1.4-1.8 times; cod: 2.0-2.8 times) than control fish caught distant from farms. Parasite loads of farm-associated wild fish were modified from control fish, with increased external and decreased internal parasites, however the strong effect of the trophic subsidy overrode any effects of altered loads upon condition.Conclusions and Significance: Proxy measures of fitness provided no evidence that salmon farms function as ecological traps for wild fish. We suggest fish farms may act as population sources for wild fish, provided they are protected from fishing while resident at farms to allow their increased condition to manifest as greater reproductive output.",,,,,,,,,64,1,0,0,61,0,64,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Parkville, Vic 3052, AustraliaSINTEF Fisheries & Aquaculture, Trondheim, NorwayUniv Alicante, Dept Marine Sci & Appl Biol, E-03080 Alicante, SpainNOFIMA, Tromso, NorwayNorwegian Inst Nat Res, N-7004 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2011-01-17,WOS:000286517600011,21264217,

The ecology of assemblages of species associated with such artificial structures is, however, poorly known. In this study, we evaluated the density and size of fish predators of echinoids (i.e., Diplodus sargus, Diplodus vulgaris, Sparus aurata), and the density of sea urchins (i.e., Paracentrotus lividus) at defence structures (i.e., breakwaters) inside and outside the marine protected area of Miramare (northern Adriatic Sea) in order to: (1) assess possible differences in fish predator density and size between protected and fished breakwaters; (2) assess whether fish predation may have the potential to affect sea urchin density in artificial rocky habitats. Surveys were carried out at four random times over a period of two years. Total density, and density of medium- and large-sized individuals of the three predatory fishes were generally greater at the protected than at the fished breakwaters, whereas no differences were detected in the density of small-sized individuals. Density of the sea urchin P. lividus did not show any difference between protected and fished breakwaters. The results of this study suggest that: (1) protection may significantly affect predatory fishes in artificial rocky habitats; (2) differences in predatory fish density, and size may be unrelated with the density of the sea urchin P. lividus; (3) protected artificial structures such as breakwaters, originally planned for other purposes, could represent a potential tool for fish population recovery and enhancement of local fisheries.

Because of structure size, carbon or high-strength steel is the most common material of construction.

These include the earlier single and subsequent triplicate design current density methods, which are reviewed. Also addressed are the recently developed first-principles-based slope parameter and unified design equation concepts, which require but a single design current density. Importance of the specified design current density, as affected by environmental conditions and calcareous deposits, is emphasized. Special topics, including deep water applications and design of retrofit systems, are discussed.",,,,,Frank Newman Speller Award Lecture at CORROSION ConferenceFrank Newman Speller Award Lecture at CORROSION Conference,"MAR 11-15, 2012MAR 11-15, 2012",,"Salt Lake City, UTSalt Lake City, UT",31,6,0,0,3,0,36,,,0010-9312,,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Atlantic Univ, Boca Raton, FL 33401 USA",,,,2013-01-02,WOS:000312010700001,,

Special issues regarding the use of seawater from the PSS (pumped storage system), such as the use of materials for the construction of the penstock, the construction of the upper reservoir, placing the pump station and the hydro power plant on the coast and the selection of pump and hydro-turbine models are presented thoroughly. Indicative results are presented from two S-PSS of small and medium size.The study proves that current technology enables the secure use of seawater in PSS. The electricity surplus from Wind Powered Pumped Storage Systems (WP-PSS) can also be exploited in reverse osmosis desalination plants for producing potable water.Seawater can be pumped directly from the sea, thus construction of a lower reservoir is avoided, compensating higher costs arising from the use of corrosion-resistant materials for certain components.

Of the various senses, hearing plays a particularly important role for fishes in providing information, often from great distances, from all around these animals. This information is in all three spatial dimensions, often overcoming the limitations of other senses such as vision, touch, taste and smell. Sound is used for communication between fishes, mating behaviour, the detection of prey and predators, orientation and migration and habitat selection. Thus, anything that interferes with the ability of a fish to detect and respond to biologically relevant sounds can decrease survival and fitness of individuals and populations. Since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, there has been a growing increase in the noise that humans put into the water. These anthropogenic sounds are from a wide range of sources that include shipping, sonars, construction activities (e.g., wind farms, harbours), trawling, dredging and exploration for oil and gas. Anthropogenic sounds may be sufficiently intense to result in death or mortal injury. However, anthropogenic sounds at lower levels may result in temporary hearing impairment, physiological changes including stress effects, changes in behaviour or the masking of biologically important sounds. The intent of this paper is to review the potential effects of anthropogenic sounds upon fishes, the potential consequences for populations and ecosystems and the need to develop sound exposure criteria and relevant regulations. However, assuming that many readers may not have a background in fish bioacoustics, the paper first provides information on underwater acoustics, with a focus on introducing the very important concept of particle motion, the primary acoustic stimulus for all fishes, including elasmobranchs. The paper then provides background material on fish hearing, sound production and acoustic behaviour. This is followed by an overview of what is known about effects of anthropogenic sounds on fishes and considers the current guidelines and criteria being used world-wide to assess potential effects on fishes. Most importantly, the paper provides the most complete summary of the effects of anthropogenic noise on fishes to date. It is also made clear that there are currently so many information gaps that it is almost impossible to reach clear conclusions on the nature and levels of anthropogenic sounds that have potential to cause changes in animal behaviour, or even result in physical harm. Further research is required on the responses of a range of fish species to different sound sources, under different conditions. There is a need both to examine the immediate effects of sound exposure and the longer-term effects, in terms of fitness and likely impacts upon populations.",,,,,,,,,192,5,0,0,146,0,217,,,0022-1112,1095-8649,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USALoughine Ltd, Aberdeen, Scotland",Loughine Ltd,,,2019-05-01,WOS:000474071500002,30864159,

Robust assessment of the influence of such structures is, therefore, a necessary consideration for their long-term management. The challenge of compiling and manipulating data for input to two North Sea models is described. Source data were processed and gridded at three different spatial resolutions to investigate the effect of scale on spatial relationships. Choice of grid size was found to exacerbate existing uncertainty in location and extent of features, influencing interpretation of their spatial distributions at the different scales examined. The small spatial footprint of man-made structures, compared with natural substrates, may lead to underestimation of the influence of the former at coarser model scales. Choices must be made between data availability, spatial resolution and accuracy, modelling and analysis requirements, to identify robust approaches to reliable outcomes. Model sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are recommended for application in data-limited situations.

Marine artificial structures are proliferating worldwide and provide a haven for marine invasive species. Such structures disrupt local hydrodynamics, which can lead to the formation of oxygen-depleted microsites. The extent to which native fauna can cope with such low oxygen conditions, and whether invasive species, long associated with artificial structures in flow-restricted habitats, have adapted to these conditions remains unclear. We measured water flow and oxygen availability in marinas and piers at the scales relevant to sessile marine invertebrates (mm). We then measured the capacity of invasive and native marine invertebrates to maintain metabolic rates under decreasing levels of oxygen using standard laboratory assays. We found that marinas reduce water flow relative to piers, and that local oxygen levels can be zero in low flow conditions. We also found that for species with erect growth forms, invasive species can tolerate much lower levels of oxygen relative to native species. Integrating the field and laboratory data showed that up to 30% of available microhabitats within low flow environments are physiologically stressful for native species, while only 18% of the same habitat is physiologically stressful for invasive species. These results suggest that invasive species have adapted to low oxygen habitats associated with manmade habitats, and artificial structures may be creating niche opportunities for invasive species.",,,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,27,0,34,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,"Monash Univ, Ctr Geometr Biol, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic, AustraliaUniv Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",,,,2017-05-17,WOS:000400445900017,28212460,

Information on lake bathymetry and wind resources were combined in simulating alternative scenarios of technically feasible turbine construction depths and distance concerns by stakeholders. These yielded estimates of developable offshore wind areas and potential power generation. While concerns about the visibility of turbines from shore reduce the power that can be generated, engineering solutions that increase the depths at which turbines can be sited increase such potential power output.

This new activity in the marine environment requires an assessment of the potential environmental impacts to resources on the OCS and evaluation of technical issues related to proposed activities. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) has two distinct programs to conduct studies and research related to renewable energy: the Environmental Studies Program (ESP) and the Technology Assessment and Research Program (TA&R). Through ESP, BOEMRE collects a wide range of environmental information offshore the United States for environmental assessment. These studies are designed to provide an improved understanding of the ecosystem, a baseline for assessing cumulative effects, and the scientific basis for development of regulatory measures to mitigate adverse impacts. Each year, BOEMRE's ESP funds roughly $35M of research in a broad spectrum of biological, social and physical disciplines. Current environmental issues of importance for offshore renewable energy include noise, lighting, habitat disruption, collision, discharges, electromagnetic fields (EMF), space-use conflicts, effects on social systems and visual impacts. Environmental studies related to renewable energy are available online at: http://www.boemre.gov/eppd/sciences/esp/RenewableEnergyResearch.htm. The BOEMRE TA&R Program funds research associated with operational safety, engineering standards and pollution prevention. The TA&R Program was established in the 1970s to ensure that industry operations on the OCS incorporate the use of the Best Available and Safest Technologies (BAST). In order to set design standards for renewable energy facilities, the TA&R Program is investigating seabed topography, bathymetry, sediment types and meteorological and oceanographic conditions. It is envisioned that wave, current and floating wind turbines and other untested technologies will be presented in the near future that will require establishing minimally acceptable design standards for permitting their deployment. Through the TA&R Program, BOEMRE is collaborating with research institutions and industry on testing renewable energy systems at Ohmsett, the National Oil Spill Response Research and Renewable Energy Test Facility. Ohmsett provides a facility for testing, research and development of large to full-scale equipment for ocean wave and current technologies. Ohmsett has 18 years experience working with customers on research projects that include testing concepts for new products not yet in production and innovative studies for technologies to include wave modeling, remote microwave wind vector sensing and mast wake characteristics with waves and calm surface.

This paper will discuss the fundamentals of RBI from a practical viewpoint and gives details of recently published applicable DNV offshore standards.Offshore structures must be inspected to maintain an acceptable safety level throughout their lifetime. Inspections have traditionally been based upon experience, and judgment of likelihood and consequence of failure. Risk based inspection planning (RBI) for structures, as developed by DNV, represents a systematic, qualitative and quantitative approach which combines theoretical models, test results and in-service experiences. The method is specially developed for application to all types of offshore structures including jackets, jack-ups, TLPs, FPSOs, Spars, Semi-submersibles, GBSs, and Subsea templates.The basis of RBI is to prioritize individual items and systems by considering the associated risks. Attention is given to high risk items, while low risk items receive a more appropriately lesser level of inspection.RBI focuses on cost optimization in all associated activities, to ensure a cost optimal inspection program.

This paper presents a series of laboratory- and field-based experiments that collectively aimed to elucidate biotic and abiotic factors that influence re-establishment success of biofouling organisms and fragmented colonial organisms defouled to the seabed. Reattachment success of colonial organisms experimentally fragmented was found to be species specific and dependent on fragment size. In both laboratory and field trials, some colonial ascidians had consistently greater reattachment success for larger size classes of fragments, while other encrusting and erect taxa showed poor reattachment capabilities. This study also revealed that sedimentation and turbidity are likely to have a strong influence on the survivorship of defouled material. Furthermore, for both high and low sedimentary environments, survivorship was found to be greater where predators were excluded. Despite risks posed by non-indigenous species (NIS), it is proposed that in-water defouling may be an appropriate management response in situations where a do nothing approach is potentially more detrimental. Moreover, results from this study suggest that environmental risks associated with defouling may be mitigated through appropriate defouling strategies (e.g., defouling location, frequency and method). In order to increase our predictive abilities for NIS establishment success resulting from in-water defouling, future studies should aim to further elucidate the relative importance of factors affecting survivorship of defouled material at locations where defouling is routinely undertaken.

Modifications include the addition of defense structures and boating infrastructure, such as seawalls and marinas that replace natural habitats. Artificial structures support different macrofaunal communities to those found on natural rocky shores; however, little is known about differences in microbial community structure or function in urban seascapes. Understanding how artificial constructions in marine environments influence microbial communities is important as these assemblages contribute to many basic ecological processes. In this study, the bacterial communities of intertidal biofilms were compared between artificial structures (seawalls) and natural habitats (rocky shores) within Sydney Harbour. Plots were cleared on each type of habitat at eight locations. After 3 weeks the newly formed biofilm was sampled and the 16S rRNA gene sequenced using the Illumina Miseq platform. To account for differences in orientation and substrate material between seawalls and rocky shores that might have influenced our survey, we also deployed recruitment blocks next to the habitats at all locations for 3 weeks and then sampled and sequenced their microbial communities. Intertidal bacterial community structure sampled from plots differed between seawalls and rocky shores, but when substrate material, age and orientation were kept constant (with recruitment blocks) then bacterial communities were similar in composition and structure among habitats. This suggests that changes in bacterial communities on seawalls are not related to environmental differences between locations, but may be related to other intrinsic factors that differ between the habitats such as orientation, complexity, or predation. This is one of the first comparisons of intertidal microbial communities on natural and artificial surfaces and illustrates substantial ecological differences with potential consequences for biofilm function and the recruitment of macrofauna.",,,,,,,,,24,1,0,0,21,0,25,,,1664-302X,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaSydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW, Australia",,,,2015-12-25,WOS:000366017200001,26635747,

However, the ability of these artificial structures to mimic natural habitats for fauna has not been evaluated. This study examined the benthic fish and macroinvertebrates assemblages (sampled using trap nets) of artificial reef complexes deployed in shallow, nearshore (9-11 m) and deeper, offshore waters (20-30 m) in the Lidao artificial reef zone (Yellow Sea, China) to determine whether they differed from assemblages on adjacent habitats: i.e. natural reefs in nearshore and bare substratum in offshore waters. It also investigated the extent of any temporal variation in these assemblages. A greater total number of taxa were identified in offshore than nearshore waters, but nearshore waters supported higher total mean numbers and biomass. No significant differences were detected in the characteristics of the benthic fish and macroinvertebrate fauna between artificial reefs and their corresponding natural habitats in both depths. Faunal composition in both depths showed strong patterns of temporal variation, mainly due to changes in the abundance of some transient fish species such as Conger myriaster and Pseudopleuronectes herzenstein, which matched seasonal patterns in water temperature and clarity. The similarity of community structure between nearshore artificial reefs and natural habitats implies that the artificial reefs are mimicking natural habitats, which facilitates functional connectivity. Thus, in the Lidao artificial reef zone, artificial reefs and natural habitats can be considered as integrated habitat management units. In the offshore waters, however, the lack of a difference in composition between habitats possibly reflects the observed sinking of the artificial reefs. This highlights the importance of detailed site assessments before the deployment of artificial reefs, particularly in silty sediments.",,,,,,,,,21,3,0,0,15,0,23,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China, Minist Educ, Key Lab Mariculture, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaDalian Ocean Univ, Ctr Marine Ranching Engn Sci Res Liaoning, Dalian 116023, Peoples R ChinaMurdoch Univ, Environm & Conservat Sci, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, AustraliaMurdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Resources, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, AustraliaMurdoch Univ, Asia Res Ctr, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, AustraliaQingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Fisheries Sci & Food Prod Proc, Qingdao 266072, Shandong, Peoples R China",,,,2019-10-09,WOS:000487810100003,,

Strong currents interacting with man-made structures can generate complex three-dimensional wakes that can make prey more accessible. Whether localised wakes from man-made structures can generate predictable foraging hotspots for top predators is unknown. Here we address this question by quantifying the relative use of an anthropogenically-generated wake by surface foraging seabirds, verified using drone transects and hydroacoustics. We show that the wake of a tidal energy structure promotes a localised and persistent foraging hotspot, with seabird numbers greatly exceeding those at adjacent natural wake features. The wake mixes material throughout the water column, potentially acting like a prey conveyer belt.

The power optimization relies on two control strategies proposed to avoid the stalling behavior, a characteristic drawback of the Wells turbine, which limits the system's power. The first control strategy is an airflow control using a PID controller tuned by the particle swarm optimization algorithm and its recent memetic variant called fractional particle swarm optimization memetic algorithm. This controller will control a throttle valve to regulate the airflow in the turbine duct. The second one consist of adequately controlling the rotational speed of the generator by means of the rotor-side converter of the back-to-back converter connected to the doubly fed induction generator to provide a swift way to respond to the rapid variations in the turbine speed.

For harbor porpoises high nocturnal echolocation activity was demonstrated near industrial structures and it was hypothesized that this was caused by increased feeding opportunities at night. Here we tested the hypothesis that bridge pillars will lead to more nocturnal echolocation activity by porpoises near them than at positions further away. The daily rhythms in porpoise detections near bridge pillars tended to be slightly more pronounced and a greater proportion of clicks occurred during the night. However, water depth had a greater impact on these rhythms, with more nocturnal porpoise echolocation activity and more pronounced daily rhythms in deeper waters. This may be related to different feeding techniques and prey choice by porpoises in deep and shallow water. In deeper water porpoises may be feeding pelagically on herring and cod, which show more activity and are easier to catch at night. In shallow water they may be targeting mainly gobies using a bottom feeding technique and this may not be more efficient at night.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,19,0,19,,,0824-0469,1748-7692,,,,,,,,,,"BioConsult SH, D-25813 Husum, Germany",BioConsult SH,,,2014-08-15,WOS:000339101800014,,

Although deep water floating wind turbines are being developed, most offshore wind farms still utilize traditional fixed-bottom foundation technologies [1]. The different types of foundation include monopile, gravity based, tripod, suction bucket and conventional steel jacket structures. Of these, monopile foundations have been the preferred foundation type so far, simply because they have an edge over other foundation types in shallow water, with regards to construction, production, assembly and cost efficiency. Over the years, there are numerous papers written on the subject of scour behavior for monopile foundations as well as a number of text books on scour at the seabed [2],[3],[4]. The effect of scour or erosion of sediment near a structure can potentially be detrimental to the stability of the structure and its fatigue life. On the other side of the coin, equally detrimental, is the effect of sediment build-up at openings and intake structures of hydroelectric power stations. Any impact or shutdown can cause losses of thousands of dollars in revenue per day as well as additional costs for manpower and repairs costs to damaged equipment when suspended sediment that is not removed, blocks and chokes valves and turbines.The core point of monitoring sediment build-up or scour is to understand the problem and carry out intervention work before it becomes unsolvable or the damage costs become multiple times more. In general, the two approaches to the design of rock protection around a monopile structure comprises either a static design or dynamic design, both of which would require monitoring of the natural variations in the level of the seabed due to movement of sand waves, sandbanks and general bed movement.Even when scour protections are applied around monopiles (as in the case of Horns Rev I Offshore Wind Farm in Denmark), it would be prudent to monitor the changes in entire scour protections as wave dominated sea conditions can be unpredictable and irregular. Even in less hostile environments such as bridge piers and docks where accessibility is not a problem, the water around these structures can often be turbulent and murky with very low or zero visibility. The traditional way of using commercial divers for inspection suffers from considerable limitations due to poor visibility and high risks to diver safety in high current and turbulent waters. Underwater inspections are often not possible during the flood events due to high volume and high flow rate of silty flood water as in the case of Bonnybrook Bridge in Calgary, Canada [5]As sonar technologies improve, interest in applying these tools for underwater inspection is increasing. A series of field tests and trial inspections both in the US and UK have been carried out using sonar and laser technology with favorable results. International Civil Engineers UK, (ICE) proceedings [6] and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), USA [7] described in great detail on the findings of using sonars for purposes of underwater inspections.The K-Observer Cloud system is a fully autonomous siltation build-up or scour monitoring system that uses permanently deployed sonars on site to provide 3D point cloud data and analysis reports of current and historic time series bathymetric data to the client in the office. The client can receive automated change detection analysis with alerts such as emails or sms for identification of changes which may exceed any threshold changes considered safe or allowable. The sonar is deployed at one location and creates a 3D map of the survey area in both horizontal and vertical planes. The rugged design of the dual axis scanning sonars, providing 3D point cloud, is ideal for long-term deployment in harsh environments. With no exposed moving parts, the transducer and rotator are contained within an adiprene, oil filled dome which inherently protects both transducer and rotator from possible damage from impacts of moving objects in the water column. Since the sonar is deployed permanently, it can capture critical changes especially in dynamic conditions which can easily be missed when conducting surveys periodically. Critical parameters of the surrounding riverbed at the intake will be scanned, at pre-defined and variable time intervals. This allows for a timely action/intervention for necessary remediation work. Together with a cloud based solution called 'Mapping Cloud' for storage, all work is done through a web browser. The physical instrumentation in the office is a small pc connected to the Internet. From the pc, datafiles are uploaded to the Mapping Cloud, with secure storage, backup and accessibility to the customer only. The real-time data can be shared between multiple users at different locations, with the owner's security and permission.Combining sonar technology with the management and dissemination of data via a cloud solution, this paper describes an autonomous system for real time monitoring of scour or sedimentation build-up using sonars deployed on site with capability of sending data, analysis reports and automated change detections alerts to users in the office.",,,,,IEEE Underwater Technology (UT) ConferenceIEEE Underwater Technology (UT) Conference,"APR 16-19, 2019APR 16-19, 2019","IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc Japan Chapter; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc Taipei Chapter; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc Taiwan Chapter; Taiwan Ocean Res Inst, Natl Appl Res LabsIEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc Japan Chapter; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc Taipei Chapter; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc Taiwan Chapter; Taiwan Ocean Res Inst, Natl Appl Res Labs","Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Kaohsiung, TAIWANNatl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Kaohsiung, TAIWAN",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2573-3788,2573-3796,978-1-5386-4188-0,,,,,,,,,"Kongsberg Mesotech Ltd, Marine Civil Engn, Port Coquitlam, BC, Canada",Kongsberg Mesotech Ltd,,,2019-11-04,WOS:000492031100041,,

In the present paper, a method is proposed for determining the appropriate size of a stop hole for cracked marine and offshore structures. In addition to the traditional concerns over the size and nature of the crack, the proposed method incorporates high-cycle and low-cycle fatigue analyses into remain service life prediction taking into account both long-term and short term wave-induced loading. The effects of the return period of the potential severest sea condition, the crack length, and the environmental severity factor on the remaining service life of a stop hole are investigated.

However, there are concerns about the negative impact of MUPs on the marine environment and ecosystem. Building an MUP with 100% renewable energy resources is still a challenge because a large storage capacity must be considered with a well-designed control system. However, marine bio-mass would play a vital role in reducing battery size and improving power supply reliability.

These barriers may displace individuals from important habitats due to direct mortality or disturbance. Understanding animal movement patterns can help avoid such impacts and manage population level effects. Avoiding impacts and implementing mitigation strategies is difficult when movement and home range information is lacking. Impact at breeding sites may negatively affect population recruitment. The number of wind farm developments is increasing in southern Australia within the core range of the south-eastern brolga (Antigone rubicunda) population. The main threats to this wetland bird include habitat loss, chick predation and collisions with power lines and fences. Wind farms may increase collision and mortality risk, and habitat displacement but the impact is difficult to assess or mitigate, as movement patterns and home range size are unknown. We deployed 11 GPS transmitters on pre-fledged brolga chicks at breeding sites in 2010-2012, including one at a wind farm, to investigate movement and home range use of brolga chicks. Brolga chicks moved 442m on average, to and from night roost wetlands (range: 0m-1964 m). The average breeding home range was 232 ha, estimated with a Brownian bridge movement model at 95% UD, but varied greatly between individuals (70 ha-523 ha). Brolgas used either single or multiple wetlands, and those using multiple wetlands either switched between them or relocated permanently. Information from this study can be used to design turbine-free buffers at brolga breeding sites and to manage breeding wetlands. (c) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

When developing energy and environmental strategies it is highly relevant to gain an insight into how to prioritise among various technology options available. One of the tools available for this purpose is the construction of cost-reduction curves, relating the marginal cost of CO2 reduction and the quantity of the reduced emission to specific technology options. This paper outlines different approaches for establishing cost-reduction curves for CO2 emissions, and a case based on the Danish Energy21-plan is analysed illustrating one of these approaches. The analysis is carried out from the broad perspective of the overall energy system, but with the main emphasis on renewable energy technologies, especially the use of wind energy and biomass in the Danish system;The paper concludes that the construction of reduction cost curves is helpful in two ways: (1) to decompose existing energy strategies (scenarios) into individual reduction options and (2) to compare new options with an existing strategy. In both cases the reduction cost curve highlights those technological options that have the highest reduction potential and the lowest marginal costs, and vice versa. Based on the case of the Danish energy plan, the results of the analyses show that a number of reduction options with significant reduction potentials are available at relatively low marginal costs.Among others can be mentioned increased use of combined heat and power (CHP), substituting conventional coal-fired CHP plants with biomass ones and the development of offshore wind turbines: (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Data sources were organized and summarized by topic - explosive removal methods, physics of underwater explosions, sea turtle resources, documented impacts to sea turtles, and mitigation of effects. Information was gathered via electronic database searches and literature source review. Bulk explosive charges are the most commonly used technique in EROS. While the physical principles of underwater detonations and the propagation of pressure and acoustic waves are well understood, there are significant gaps in the application of this knowledge. Impacts to sea turtles from explosive removal operations may range from non-injurious effects (e.g. acoustic annoyance; mild tactile detection or physical discomfort) to varying levels of injury (i.e. non-lethal and lethal injuries). Very little information exists regarding the impacts of underwater explosions on sea turtles. Effects of explosions on turtles often must be inferred from documented effects to other vertebrates with lungs or other gas-containing organs, such as mammals and most fishes. However, a cautious approach should be used when determining impacts to sea turtles based on extrapolations from other vertebrates. The discovery of beached sea turtles and bottlenose dolphins following an explosive platform removal event in 1986 prompted the initiation of formal consultation between the U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), authorized through the Endangered Species Act Section 7, to determine a mechanism to minimize potential impacts to listed species. The initial consultation resulted in a requirement for oil and gas companies to obtain a permit (through separate consultations on a case-by-case basis) prior to using explosives in Federal waters. Because many offshore structure removal operations are similar, a generic Incidental Take Statement was established by the NMFS that describes requirements to protect sea turtles when an operator's individual charge weights did not exceed 50 1b (23 kg). Requirements associated with the Incidental Take Permit were revised in 2003 and 2006 to accommodate advances in explosive charge technologies, removals of structures in deeper waters, and adequate protection of deep water marine mammal species in Gulf of Mexico waters. Generally, these requirements include pre- and post-detonation visual monitoring using standard surface and aerial survey methods for sea turtles and marine mammals, and, in some scenarios, passive acoustic survey methods for marine mammals within a specified radius from an offshore structure. The survey program has been successful in mitigating impacts to sea turtles associated with EROS. However, even with these protective measures in place, there have been observations of sea turtles affected by explosive platform removals. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

A long-term time-lapse camera was deployed for 27 four-month deployment periods at 4100m in the eastern North Pacific to study abyssal megafauna activity and surface-benthos connections. The unique time-series data set provided by this research presented an opportunity to examine how deep-sea benthopelagic fish and epibenthic megafauna populations were affected by an isolated artificial structure and whether animal surveys at this site were biased by aggregation behavior. Counts were taken of benthopelagic grenadiers, Coryphaenoides spp., observed per week as well as numbers of the epibenthic echinoid Echinocrepis rostrata. No significant correlation (r(s) = -0.39; p = 0. 11) was found between the duration of deployment (in weeks) and the average number of Coryphaenoides observed at the site. There was also no evidence of associative behavior around the time-lapse camera by E rostrata (r(s) = -0.32; p = 0. 19). The results of our study suggest that abyssal fish and epibenthic megafauna do not aggregate around artificial structures and that long-term time-lapse camera studies should not be impacted by aggregation response behaviors.

The Gulf is no exception, with most major urban centers directly adjacent to coasts, with its people both culturally and economically tied to marine resources. Coastal development has rapidly expanded in the Gulf since the 1950s, leading to an increase in the exploitation of coastal marine resources and the degradation of coastal habitats (Al-Madani et al. 1991; Mohammed and Al-Sadh 1996). Coastal fisheries throughout the Gulf are being increasingly exploited, with demersal reef fisheries stocks declining by over four-fifths in the past three decades (see Chap. 8), while dredging, reclamation, and associated coastal development activities have contributed to the permanent loss or long-term degradation of important intertidal, sea-grass, mangrove, and coral reef habitats throughout the Gulf (Price 1993; Al-Jamali et al. 2005; Khan 2007; Burt et al. 2008, 2009b; Maghsoudlou et al. 2008; Sheppard et al. 2010, chapter 16).

Based on this synoptic survey, we produced a spatial map of Red Snapper relative abundance that integrates both gear selectivity effects and ontogenetically varying habitat usage. Our methodology generated a spatial map of Red Snapper at a 10-km(2) grid resolution that is consistent with existing knowledge of the species: Red Snapper occurred in relatively high abundances at depths of 50-90 m along the coasts of Texas and Louisiana and in smaller, patchy hot spots at a variety of depths along the Alabama coast and the west Florida shelf. Red Snapper biomass and fecundity estimates were higher for the northwestern GOM than for the northeastern GOM, as the latter area contained mostly smaller, younger individuals. The existence of similar surveys on petroleum platforms and artificial reefs also enabled us to calculate their relative contribution to Red Snapper distribution compared with that of natural habitats. We estimated that for the youngest ageclasses, catch rates were approximately 20 times higher on artificial structures than on natural reefs. Despite the high catch rates observed on artificial structures, they represent only a small fraction of the total area in the northern GOM; thus, we estimated that they held less than 14% of Red Snapper abundance. Because artificial structures-particularly petroleum platforms-attractmostly the youngest individuals, their contribution was even lower in terms of total population biomass (7.8%) or spawning potential (6.4%). Our estimates of Red Snapper relative abundance, biomass, and spawning potential can be used to design spatial management strategies or as inputs to spatial modeling techniques.",,,,,,,,,60,0,0,0,53,0,70,,,1942-5120,,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 75 Virginia Beach Dr, Miami, FL 33149 USANOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Mississippi Labs, 3209 Frederic St, Pascagoula, MS 39567 USARiverside Technol Inc, NOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Mississippi Labs, 3209 Frederic St, Pascagoula, MS 39567 USAUniv S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, 5871 USA Dr North, Mobile, AL 36688 USADauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA",,,,2017-09-01,WOS:000407996400005,,

Integrated evaluations of ARs are necessary to comprehend the condition and benefits of these structures. Multimetric indices (ARMIs) were developed to evaluate fish assemblages associated with artificial structures and to assess the efficiency of the AR compared to control area (CA). The AR global ranking index (ARMIr) and AR local effect index (ARMIe) include 16 metrics that represent four broad levels of the fish community: structure of fish assemblages, trophic structure, vulnerability and economic importance. Individual metrics were evaluated using a long-term dataset of fish assemblages from the AR and CA in northern Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Bottom gillnets were used to sample the fish two times per year for 21 years after creating the reef. The ARMIr general score for the AR was 51 out of a possible 100, with scores varying from 38 to 54. The ARMIr general score for the CA was 39 out of 100, with scores varying from 35 to 47. Average ARMIe values were 12% higher for the AR in relation to the CA. Spatial-temporal comparisons of the ARMIr using generalized additive models revealed significant differences between AR and CA. Evaluations of the ARMIe scores revealed that the assemblage structure and economic importance level significantly increased over time in the AR. The proposed indices combine structural and functional levels of fish, providing a robust and sensitive method to evaluate the ecological condition of ARs and adjacent areas. The data contribute to discussions related to ARs management and provides a baseline for defining fish assemblage metrics in assessment of localities with artificial structures.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0964-5691,,,,,,,,,,,"State Univ North Rio de Janeiro, Ctr Biosci & Biotechnol, Campos Dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil",,,,2020-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15903008775,,

Throughout the study site, positioning design and respective detection ranges of five receivers created 17 regions of overlap between two to five receivers. The detection range of the hydrophones was found to be 500 m. Weighted means of modified detection numbers were used to calculate the pinger's position in the study area. Pinger positioning error (Pe) was defined as the distance between the calculated geographical coordinates and the real ones. The artificial reef characterization results showed that the position error is related to the number of receivers overlapping. Minimal positional error was found in regions with four and five overlapping receivers (Pe is 54[plus or minus]24 m). The barrier effect of an artificial structure on signals detection depends on the distance between obstacle and transmitter.

SSP is vulnerable to the heave motions, and continuous heave motions may cause fatigue damage to the structural and nonstructural members or even sinking of the platform. It is therefore imperative to suppress the undesired heave motions of SSP. In the present study, a novel hydraulic rotational inertia damper (RID), which can amplify the fluid resistance of the submerged plates, is proposed on the basis of the concept of inerter to mitigate the heave motions of SSP. Analytical studies are conducted in both the frequency and time domains to investigate the control effectiveness of the proposed method. For comparison, the responses of the SSP controlled by the commonly adopted fixed heave plate (FHP) and tuned heave plate (THP) are also calculated. Analytical results show that the proposed RID system is more effective in reducing the heave motions of SSP, and it can achieve the identical control performance of the FHP and THP systems by using a much smaller plate size, thus smaller physical mass (less than 0.8% of the mass of the heave plate in this research).

Aquila audax fleayi is an endemic Tasmanian subspecies isolated for 10,000 years from the nominate subspecies on the Australian mainland. The Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle is classified nationally and at a State level as endangered due to its small number of breeding pairs, low breeding success and high rate of mortality from unnatural causes. The subspecies experiences mortality throughout its range from shooting, poisoning, trapping, road accidents, electrocutions and collisions with wind turbines, aircraft, fences and overhead wires, which we term 'un-natural mortality'. A portion of the subspecies' range is managed for timber production, which can lead to disturbance of nest sites and the loss of nest trees. We use a model of the eagle population from the Bass District in northeast Tasmania to explore the relative importance of different sources of mortality and nesting habitat loss, and the potential for mitigating impacts associated with unnatural mortality, disturbance, nesting habitat loss and human access to forests. We create a habitat map including suitable nest sites and link it to a dynamic landscape population model based on life history traits and disturbance responses. Using the program RAMAS-Landscape, we model alternative forest management scenarios, ranging from no timber harvesting and a natural wildfire regime, to scenarios prescribing native forest harvesting and regeneration and different levels of conversion of native forest to plantation under the same natural wildfire regime. The results indicate that the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle is sensitive to unnatural mortality, plantation establishment and native forest harvesting. The predicted decline over the next 160 years (similar to 65%) will most likely be driven largely by loss of current and potential future nest sites associated with harvesting activities, exacerbated by unnatural mortality in the wider landscape. Interventions that minimise unnatural mortality, reduce nest disturbance, and retain breeding habitat and nest sites may improve the prospects for the subspecies in the Bass District. If nest disturbance and unnatural mortality continue at the rates modelled here, the species appears to face a high risk of declining substantially in the region.

We investigated the characteristics of Eastern Osprey nest-sites while surveying [approximately]200 km of coastline by boat. Two areas with contrasting urbanisation levels were inspected: the highly urbanised coastline fringing the Moreton Bay Marine Park (MBMP), and the less-developed coastal area within the Great Sandy Marine Park (GSMP). Nests in both areas had similar levels of exposure and aspect. In MBMP, significantly more nests were found on artificial structures, such as communications towers and navigation beacons, than in GSMP. The selection of these artificial structures potentially increases the risk of harm to the birds and may affect the functioning of the devices, with possible implications for human safety.

Interest in designing marine developments that maintain vital ecosystems and critical services is growing, but progress requires understanding the factors that influence the ecological performance of these novel artificial habitats.We combined field observations and experiments along 500 km of the North Adriatic coastline to analyse the performance of artificial substrata as habitats to support canopy-forming algae belonging to the genus Cystoseira, among the most ecologically relevant foundation species along rocky Mediterranean coastlines. We aimed to: clarify the underlying factors controlling the growth of Cystoseira in the artificial habitat; contrast the relative importance of these factors between artificial and natural habitats; and test the generality of the results across different sites and species of Cystoseira.We found that: (i) the growth of canopy algae was significantly lower on artificial structures compared to rocky reefs; (ii) such lower growth of canopy algae was not related to less favourable abiotic conditions but to higher biotic disturbance from both consumptive and nonconsumptive interactions on the artificial structures compared to the natural reef; and iii) this was consistent across different study sites and canopy-forming species.We conclude that biological factors influencing the growth of canopy algae, such as herbivory or other nonconsumptive disturbances, can differ substantially between artificial and natural habitats. The unusually large and previously unreported biotic pressure characterizing many artificial structures can negatively affect their performance as habitats to support ecologically relevant, foundation species.Synthesis and applications.

When forecasting wind speeds, most models focus on the average wind speeds over a given period, but this value alone represents only a small part of the true wind conditions. We present statistical models to predict the full distribution of the maximum-value wind speeds in a 3h interval. We take a detailed look at the performance of linear models, generalized additive models and multivariate adaptive regression splines models using meteorological covariates such as gust speed, wind speed, convective available potential energy, Charnock, mean sea-level pressure and temperature, as given by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts forecasts. The models are trained to predict the mean value of maximum wind speed, and the residuals from training the models are used to develop the full probabilistic distribution of maximum wind speed. Knowledge of the maximum wind speed for an offshore location within a given period can inform decision-making regarding turbine operations, planned maintenance operations and power grid scheduling in order to improve safety and reliability, and probabilistic forecasts result in greater value to the end-user. The models outperform traditional baseline forecast methods and achieve low predictive errors on the order of 1-2ms(-1).

Flight trajectories were recorded using surveillance radar at a Danish offshore wind farm with emphasis placed on the 200 000+ migrating common eiders that pass through the area annually. Minimum distance to wind farm and curvature of trajectories were compared pre- and post-construction. Additional costs of the avoidance response were estimated using an avian energetic model. The curvature of eider trajectories was greatest post-construction and within 500 m of the wind farm, with a median curvature significantly greater than pre-construction, suggesting that the birds adjusted their flight paths in the presence of the wind farm. Additional distance travelled as a consequence of the wind farm's presence was ca. 500 m and trivial compared with the total costs of a migration episode of 1400 km.

Initially, a review of the general approaches following the conventional categorization of passive, active, semi-active and hybrid is presented. This is then followed by a review of the specific marine offshore vibration control methods and a comparison of the approaches. The marine offshore structures considered in this review include jacket structures, tension leg platforms (TLPs), spar structures, floating production storage and offloading vessels (FPSOs) and riser structures.

We used an online survey and participatory mapping exercise to investigate differences in priority goals, sites and attitudes towards ecological engineering between marine scientists and coastal managers as compared to other stakeholders. The surveys were conducted across three Australian cities that varied in their level of urbanisation and environmental pressures. We tested the hypotheses that, relative to other stakeholders, marine scientists and coastal managers will: 1) be more supportive of ecological engineering; 2) be more likely to agree that enhancement of biodiversity and remediation of pollution are key priorities for ecological engineering; and 3) identify different priority areas and infrastructure or degraded habitats for ecological engineering. We also tested the hypothesis that 4) perceptions of ecological engineering would vary among locations, due to environmental and socio-economic differences. In all three harbours, marine scientists and coastal managers were more supportive of ecological engineering than other users. There was also greater support for ecological engineering in Sydney and Melbourne than Hobart. Most people identified transport infrastructure, in busy transport hubs (i.e. Circular Quay in Sydney, the Port in Melbourne and the Waterfront in Hobart) as priorities for ecological engineering, irrespective of their stakeholder group or location.

Majewski, University of Virginia Main Campus AST-1009973, James Bullock, University of California-Irvine This is a comprehensive study of the formation and evolution of the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of Andromeda (M31). These satellites within the Local Group include the least luminous galaxies known and they can be explored to test ideas about star formation in the smallest dark matter halos and at the earliest times. Extensive data sets on the resolved stellar populations of M31 satellites are combined with state-of-the-art galaxy models in order to learn how the dynamical -, merger -, assembly -, star formation -, and chemical enrichment histories of the current and past M31 satellite systems fit together in the context of the general paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation. The data for M31 are compared to the satellites and halo population of the Milky Way galaxy for which were previously studied by the investigators. The Milky Way and M31 are both spiral galaxies but have different populations of satellite galaxies for which an explanations needs to be found.

Majewski, University of Virginia Main Campus AST-1009973, James Bullock, University of California-Irvine This is a comprehensive study of the formation and evolution of the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of Andromeda (M31). These satellites within the Local Group include the least luminous galaxies known and they can be explored to test ideas about star formation in the smallest dark matter halos and at the earliest times. Extensive data sets on the resolved stellar populations of M31 satellites are combined with state-of-the-art galaxy models in order to learn how the dynamical -, merger -, assembly -, star formation -, and chemical enrichment histories of the current and past M31 satellite systems fit together in the context of the general paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation. The data for M31 are compared to the satellites and halo population of the Milky Way galaxy for which were previously studied by the investigators. The Milky Way and M31 are both spiral galaxies but have different populations of satellite galaxies for which an explanations needs to be found. The additional data for M31 are important for evaluating solutions to the ?missing satellites problem? in Lambda-Cold Dark Matter (CDM) simulations, where the number of subhalos is predicted to be higher than the number of observed satellites.

With a continued requirement to produce oil or gas, either from the original fields or as a base for neighbouring subsea completions, many of these respective offshore installations are likely to remain operational for a period of time in the foreseeable future. The ageing offshore infrastructure presents a constant and growing challenge. Ageing is characterised by deterioration, change in operational conditions or accidental damages which, in the severe operational environment offshore, can be significant with serious consequences for installation integrity if not managed adequately and efficiently.In order to ensure technical and operational integrity of these ageing facilities, the fitness for service of these offshore structures should be maintained. The maintenance of structural integrity is a significant consideration in the safety management and life extension of offshore installations. Detailed integrity assessments are needed to demonstrate that there is sufficient technical, operational and organisational integrity to continue safe operation throughout a life extension. Information on history, characteristic data, condition data and inspection results are required to assess the current state and to predict the future state of the facility and the possible life extension.This paper presents state of art practices in life extension of existing offshore structures and an overview of various aspects of ageing related to offshore facilities, represented risk to the integrity of a facility and the required procedures and re assessment criteria for deciding on life extension.This paper also provides an overall view in the structural requirements, justifications and calibrations of the original design for the life extension to maintain the safety level by means of a maintenance and inspection programs balancing the ageing mechanisms and improving the reliability of assessment results.",,,,,"31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUL 01-06, 2012JUL 01-06, 2012","Petrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivPetrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,978-0-7918-4489-2,,,,,,,,,"Worley Parsons, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Worley Parsons,,,2013-11-05,WOS:000324716900020,,

Therefore, the extent to which mean stresses can enhance corrosion-assisted fatigue damage in these structures needs to be better understood. A new theoretical model that accounts for mean stress effects on corrosion fatigue crack growth is proposed. The model is developed based on the relative crack opening period per fatigue cycle and by considering only the damaging portion of the stress cycle. The baseline data for the modelling exercise are the data obtained at a stress ratio of 0.1 in air and seawater tests conducted on compact tension specimens. The model is validated by comparison with experimental data and with other fatigue crack propagation models.

The spatial distribution of meiofaunal assemblages was established along a transect running from within each reef to well outside its direct sphere of influence, along with information on the trophic conditions of sediments (chloropigments, proteins, carbohydrates, and total organic matter). Although total densities were significantly higher in the Adriatic than in the Tyrrhenian, the meiofauna displayed a similar spatial distribution at the two sites, with highest densities being reached between 2 and 20 m away from the reef area and lowest densities among the reef blocks. This pattern corresponded largely with variations in grain size and oxygen penetration in the sediment. Total densities inside the reef areas were significantly lower than at the control station 50 m from the reef, suggesting that processes influencing meiofaunal assemblages largely reflect the interaction between reef and surrounding soft sediments, independently of differences in latitude, sediment texture, and trophic conditions. The results indicate that the proximity of artificial structures altered the composition of meiofaunal assemblages significantly, with potentially important implications for their role in secondary production and energy transfer to higher trophic levels.",,,,,7th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and related Aquatic Habitats7th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and related Aquatic Habitats,"OCT 07-11, 1999OCT 07-11, 1999",ICES; Italian Soc Marine Biol; European Artificial Reef Res Network; Sanremo Congressi Turismo; Univ Geona; Phillips Petr; European Commiss; US Natl Marine Fisheries ServICES; Italian Soc Marine Biol; European Artificial Reef Res Network; Sanremo Congressi Turismo; Univ Geona; Phillips Petr; European Commiss; US Natl Marine Fisheries Serv,"SAN REMO, ITALYSAN REMO, ITALY",45,0,0,0,46,2,58,,,1054-3139,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Ancona, Inst Marine Sci, I-60131 Ancona, ItalyUniv Palermo, Dept Anim Biol, I-90123 Palermo, Italy",,,,2002-10-01,WOS:000179243500056,,

Due to the harsh marine environment and tough working conditions, the FBG sensors must have sufficient protection and good repeatability for long-term monitoring. Thorough research has been conducted to identify the most suitable, commercially available protection packaging for FBG sensors for offshore applications. Further, the performance of the selected FBG sensor packaging is tested under conditions of strong sunlight, heavy rain, and salty water in order to emulate the marine environment. Moreover, the installation method of the packaged FBG sensors is equally important, as it ensures the repeatability and durability of the sensors for their long-term performance. It is shown that the packaged FBG sensors can be installed using resin-based epoxy to maintain the repeatability of the sensor over the long-term.

Here, we tested 1) whether the fish community on a newly deployed artificial reef converged with the fish community on an adjacent, established artificial reef over time and 2) whether fish colonization of the new artificial reef occurred sequentially. To answer these questions, we simultaneously collected time-lapse videos of fishes colonizing a new (2 wks old) artificial reef and those inhabiting a nearby (438 m away) established (> 20 yrs old) artificial reef. We found that fish community composition on the new artificial reef converged with the fish community composition on the established artificial reef over five months. Community development on the new reef followed a trajectory: schooling, planktivorous fishes initially colonized the reef in high numbers, whereas demersal fishes exhibited delayed colonization. These findings suggest that fishes may colonize human-made reefs along a specific trajectory of pelagic fishes followed by demersal fishes and that community convergence between reefs can occur over relatively short temporal scales given similar environmental conditions. When deploying additional structures, including human-engineered habitats, in the marine environment, our findings on fish colonization of artificial reefs are important to consider because they provide new insight into how artificial structures can be utilized to enhance particular fishes over different temporal scales.",,,,,,,,,18,1,0,0,13,0,20,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,,,,,,,"Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Marine Sci, 3431 Arendell St, Morehead City, NC 28557 USAUniv North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Biol, 120 South Rd, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USANOAA, Natl Ocean Serv, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, 101 Pivers Isl Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USADuke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Marine Lab, 135 Duke Marine Lab Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA",,,,2018-11-01,WOS:000446253500020,,

However, they may still be subject to degradation processes such as corrosion considering the conditions in marine environment. Pitting corrosion is a destructive form of corrosion which reduces the material resistance and may result in failure accidents with severe financial, human life and environmental consequences. The process of pitting corrosion is inconsistent and largely stochastic being influenced by a number of parameters with a high level of uncertainty. This makes it very difficult to predict corrosion in terms of its initiation time and spatial behavior. Therefore, it is vital to investigate pitting corrosion phenomena in offshore structures using a probabilistic approach for the assessment of structural reliability and operational safety. In this study, an in-situ experiment has been conducted on X80 steel in an NaCl solution in a laboratory environment to observe the generation and growth of corrosion pits. A probabilistic model based on Hierarchical Bayesian Approach (HBA) is developed for predicting the pitting corrosion growth rate using experimental results. In order to model the process more realistically, the proposed methodology considers the degradation process to be consisting of the time needed for pit initiation and propagation. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is capable of predicting the time required to reach a specific pit size. The methodology developed in this study can be applied to estimate the remaining useful life of subsea structures. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To date, designers of shipyards have developed in-house simulation systems or used commercial systems such as the QUEST by Dassault system when requests for the simulation of process planning have occurred. However, these methods have some limitations. First, it requires a lot of time to develop a new in-house simulation system. In addition, it is hard to reuse previously developed systems when developing a new one and it is also hard for these to satisfy the various needs of shipyards effectively.To solve these limitations, an integrated simulation framework is proposed in this study. The proposed simulation framework provides an environment for developing various simulation systems for shipbuilding process planning. It consists of a simulation kernel, basic simulation component and application-specific simulation component. The simulation kernel manages both DEVS (discrete event system specification) and DTSS (discrete time system specification) to deal with various simulation requests. The basic simulation component provides commonly used simulation models and modeling strategies, which are used to make a simulation system more efficient. The application-specific simulation component implements the dynamics analysis, collision detection and realistic three-dimensional visualization.To evaluate its efficiency and applicability, the proposed simulation framework is applied to the block erection process of ships and offshore structures. The results show that the proposed simulation framework, as compared with those of existing studies and of commercial simulation systems, can provide a consistent, integrated development environment for a simulation system.

However, as the installation of wind farms rises, so will the need for decommissioning and analysis of the environmental impacts associated with decommissioning. This paper investigates how Environmental Impacts Assessments (EIA) identify, estimate and manage potential impacts of decommissioning. EIAs from 12 onshore and offshore windfarms consented between 2009 and 2014 in England and Scotland were analysed and compared. Attributes of these windfarms' Environmental Statements (ES) were scored under six categories: decommissioning in EIA stages, definitions of decommissioning, amount of analysis, depth of analysis, impacts identified, and proactive planning. Onshore windfarms generally tended to investigate the impacts of decommissioning less than offshore windfarms, even those which gained consent in the same year. The investigation of the impact of decommissioning improved for windfarms consented in the latter years of the study period. Across the ESs there was a lack of analysis of potential impacts from decommissioning in their own right: not simply as a reversal of the construction process. The impacts of different end of life scenarios were not analysed in any of the ESs studied. There is evidence to suggest the presence of windfarms, especially offshore, could in some cases be environmentally beneficial for certain species. However, the ecological impact of removing offshore structures at the end of life is unknown and is currently not investigated nor predicted in EIAs. Understanding the potential implications of full or partial removal of marine structures, or alternatives to decommissioning, could ensure that appropriate mitigation is considered at an early stage by both developer and consenting authority.

The aim of the present study was to investigate interactions between fish and sessile biota growing on urban structures in coastal waterways. The biota growing on subtidal hard substrata is thought to have a large effect on the composition and distribution of associated fish. Hence, in Sydney Harbour, Australia, experiments were done to test interactions between fish and epibiota sampled on pilings at 4 marinas. The abundance and diversity of fish were strongly positively correlated with the amount of foliose algae, mussels and solitary ascidians on pilings. This correlative evidence was further investigated by experimental manipulations of the amount of conspicuous epibiota on pilings. Removal of these organisms showed a marked decrease in the numbers of many types of fish. Conversely, the addition of mussels to pilings increased the abundance and diversity of associated fish. The cover of complex epibiota on pilings at marinas may strongly affect the abundance of many species of fish and therefore influence the types of fish that recruit to these artificial habitats. Such knowledge on the ecological processes occurring in marinas is an important step in recognising the value of these artificial structures as habitat for marine organisms.",,,,,,,,,50,0,0,0,45,1,52,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sydney, Marine Ecol Labs A11, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000245542400017,,

Eco-engineering aims to create sustainable ecosystems that integrate human society with the natural environment for the benefit of both. The science of eco-engineering has grown markedly, yet synthesis of research into a user-friendly and practitioner-focused format is lacking. Feedback from stakeholders has repeatedly stated that a photo user guide or manual covering the range of eco-engineering options available for artificial structures would be beneficial. However, a detailed and structured user guide for eco-engineering in coastal and marine environments is not yet possible; therefore we present an accessible review and catalogue of trialled eco-engineering options and a summary of guidance for a range of different structures tailored for stakeholders and end-users as the first step towards a structured manual. This work can thus serve as a potential template for future eco-engineering guides. Here we provide suggestions for potential eco-engineering designs to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services of coastal artificial structures with the following structures covered: (1) rock revetment, breakwaters and groynes composed of armour stones or concrete units; (2) vertical and sloping seawalls; (3) over-water structures (i.e., piers) and associated support structures; and (4) tidal river walls.",,,,,,,,,66,0,0,0,47,0,70,,,1083-8155,1573-1642,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandUniv Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO17 3ZH, Hants, EnglandMarine Biol Assoc UK, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, EnglandAberystwyth Univ, Inst Biol Environm & Rural Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3DA, Dyfed, WalesUniv Plymouth, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandKings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, EnglandBritish Ecol Soc, Charles Darwin House, London WC1N 2JU, EnglandUniv Plymouth, Sch Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",British Ecol Soc,,,2019-12-28,WOS:000504587100001,,

The oceanic environmental phenomena to which such structures may be exposed include freak/rogue waves, impact pressure actions (arising from sloshing, slamming, and green water), collisions, grounding, dropped objects, fire, and explosions. All of these phenomena have highly nonlinear structural consequences that result in geometric and material nonlinearities. Although the identification of both the actions and their effects is equally important in terms of structural design and strength assessments, this paper focuses on the action effects associated with nonlinear structural mechanics and the subsequent analysis of limit states and risk assessment and management. Future trends and further R&D requirements are also addressed.

At the same time, the growth kinetics of such short cracks has been shown to be more rapid than those of long cracks; however it is upon the latter that most historical studies have focused. In the present paper, the results of scanning electron microscope fractographic analyses performed upon five high strength steels fatigued in air and seawater are presented. These revealed fracture surface morphology distinctions that were a unique function of material, environment (air versus seawater), potential, and crack length, and that the enhanced fatigue crack growth rate in the short crack regime was relatable to these morphological features. Of particular importance were (1) the development of secondary cracks as a precursor for the short crack to long crack growth rate kinetics transition, and (2) a change in fracture mode, either from quasicleavage (QC) to microvoid coalescence (MVC) or from intergranular to QC or MVC with increasing crack length.

Wave loading on slender members of bottom-supported jacket or jack-up structures is frequently calculated by Morison's equation. Due to nonlinearity of the drag component of Morison wave loading and also due to intermittency of wave loading on members in the splash zone, the response is often non-Gaussian; therefore, simple techniques for derivation of their extreme response probability distribution are not available. Finite-memory nonlinear systems (FMNS) are extensively used in establishing a simple relationship between the output and input of complicated nonlinear systems. In this paper, it will be shown how the response of an offshore structure exposed to Morison wave loading can be approximated by the response of an equivalent finite-memory nonlinear system. The approximate models can then be used to determine the probability distribution of response extreme values with great efficiency. Part I of this paper is devoted to the development of an efficient FMNS model for offshore structural response while part H is devoted to the validation of the developed models.

This paper presents the validation of the first floating LiDAR buoy in Northeast US waters. The buoy, named DeepCLiDAR, includes a LiDAR, ecological monitoring sensors, and metocean sensors. A three-phase LiDAR validation plan was executed, and its results are presented. The objective of the validation plan was to verify the accuracy of measurements made by the LiDAR buoy in wave environments against an unmoving reference wind measurement. Due to a lack of reference met masts, the use of a LiDAR on land as a baseline reference was implemented for validation. Comparison to a reference LiDAR instead of a traditional meteorological tower was a unique approach required in the Northeast US waters due to the absence of a reference fixed-bottom meteorological tower in the region at the time of this study. The testing included a comparison of wind speed measurements made by the buoy deployed 15 km offshore from the mainland and a land-based reference LiDAR located on a nearby island.

They are often located in areas of high disturbance and can vary significantly in the area of free space provided for settlement of marine organisms. Whilst correlation between the amount of free space available and recruitment success has been shown in populations of several marine benthic organisms, there has been relatively little focus on invasive species, a group with the potential to reproduce in vast numbers and colonise habitats rapidly. Invasion success following different scales of disturbance was examined in the invasive acorn barnacle, Austrominius modestus, on a unique art installation located in Liverpool Bay. Population growth and recruitment success were examined by comparing recruitment rates within disturbance clearings of 4 different sizes and by contrasting population development with early recruitment rates over a 10 week period. Disturbed areas were rapidly recolonised and monocultures of A. modestus formed within 6 weeks. The size of patch created during disturbance had no effect on the rate of recruitment, while a linear relationship between recruit density and patch size was observed. Density-dependent processes mediated initial high recruitment resulting in population stability after 8-10 weeks, but densities continued to greatly exceed those reported in natural habitats. Given that artificial structures are likely to continue to proliferate in light of climate change projections, free-space is likely to become more available more frequently in the future supporting the expansion of fast-colonising species.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,22,0,27,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, EnglandNatl Univ Ireland Galway, Ryan Inst, Galway, Ireland",,,,2013-09-04,WOS:000324515600141,24023944,

Upon arrival in new environments, invaders must overcome biotic resistance from native competitors and predators if they are to establish successfully in natural habitats. We tested the hypotheses that (1) artificial structures (e. g., suspended aquaculture installations) present a niche opportunity for invasive species by providing a refuge from native benthic predators, and (2) native predators in natural benthic habitats suppress successful colonization by invaders. A recruitment experiment showed that the ascidians Pyura chilensis (native) and Ciona intestinalis (invasive) could recruit to both suspended artificial structures and natural benthic habitats. Ciona, however, was only able to establish adult populations on artificial structures. In natural benthic habitats Ciona only recruited and grew in predator-exclusion cages, because without this protection predation prevented its establishment. In predation experiments, native invertebrate and fish predators removed all invasive ascidians (recruits and adults) in benthic habitats, which contrasted with the high adult survival of the native ascidian P. chilensis. The refuge from a number of benthic predators facilitates the establishment of large populations of invasive species on suspended structures. We present a conceptual model of the invasion processes that includes the anthropogenic structures as a transitional stepping-stone that facilitates invasion by enhancing and prolonging propagule supply to surrounding natural communities. Those established invaders might then overcome biotic resistance during time periods when populations of consumers or competitors are weakened by natural or anthropogenic disturbances. Our results suggest that the conservation of natural habitats with a high diversity of native predators can be an effective means to prevent the spread of invasive species growing on suspended structures.",,,,,,,,,87,0,0,0,87,2,100,,,1387-3547,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Hong Kong, Swire Inst Marine Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaUniv Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaUniv Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, ChileCtr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas CEAZA, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile",Ctr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas CEAZA,,,2011-09-01,WOS:000296348000007,,

The future values of wave height are generated by regionalizing or downscaling wind information obtained from a general circulation model run for various scenarios of global warming. The predicted wave heights for the next 30 years are then fitted to Gumbel or Weibull distributions to estimate the significant wave height with a return period of 100 years and these estimates are compared with those obtained from the past 30 years hindcast. In general, it is found that if climate change is considered in the evaluation of design-significant wave heights then a considerable increase in their magnitudes is likely.

Yet there are many uncertainties about how wind farms affect marine organisms and their environment. The before-after-control-impact (BACI) design, an approach that compares an impact location with an unaffected control both before and after the intervention, is the most common method used to study how offshore wind farms affect finfish. Unfortunately, this design has several methodological limitations that undermine its ability to detect effects in these studies. An alternative approach, the before-after-gradient (BAG) design, would sample along a gradient with increasing distance from the turbines both before and after the intervention, and could overcome many of the limitations of BACI. The BAG design would eliminate the difficult task of finding a suitable control, allow for the assessment of the spatial scale and extent of wind farm effects, and improve statistical power by incorporating distance as an independent variable in analytical models rather than relegating it to the error term. This article explores the strengths and weaknesses of the BACI and BAG designs in the context of offshore wind development and suggests an approach to incorporating the BAG design into existing fisheries surveys and a regional monitoring framework.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,15,1,32,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"Integrat Sci Grp, POB 1228, Columbia, MD 21044 USANOAA, Integrated Stat, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA",Integrat Sci Grp,,,2020-12-31,WOS:000562460200004,,

The median date of such activity in autumn usually occurred in September and without any significant difference in timing in relation to latitude.

This study investigated whether colonisation of space can determine the occurrence of different intertidal assemblages on rocky shores and sandstone seawalls in Sydney Harbour (New South Wales, Australia). Areas were cleared on rocky shores and seawalls at 3 different locations to test hypotheses from 2 alternative models: (1) patterns of distribution and abundance of organisms on the 2 types of structure are the direct result of different patterns of recruitment and (2) early stages of development of assemblages are the same on the 2 types of structure, but later processes (post-recruitment) differ between structures, producing different older assemblages. Furthermore, the model that assemblages developing in clearings on each structure would converge toward mature assemblages found on the same type of structure was tested. Assemblages in clearings differed between seawalls and rocky shores from the early stages of succession and differences persisted through time. Although there was variability among locations, these assemblages tended to converge toward mature assemblages on the same type of structure. These results support the model that intrinsic differences (e.g. topography, weathering, shape and extent of surfaces) between seawalls and rocky shores could affect the recruitment of algae and invertebrates, leading to the establishment of distinct assemblages. This knowledge could improve our ability to design artificial structures that more closely mimic natural habitats, potentially mitigating some effects of loss and fragmentation of coastal habitats in urban areas.",,,,,,,,,90,0,0,0,85,0,98,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sydney, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Marine Labs A11, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000227950300006,,

Our field survey revealed differential distribution patterns among the four ascidians recorded, with infiltration of natural rocky habitats by two species, Botrylloides violaceus and Botryllus schlosseri. We did not record Didemnum vexillum or Styela clava in natural habitats, though they were both recorded on adjacent artificial structures. Globally, these ascidian species are predominantly found associated with anthropogenic habitats including floating docks, pilings and aquaculture installations, but they have infiltrated natural habitats in some areas of their introduced range.

UVCs and BCs recorded a comparable number and relative abundance of species, which in turn were much greater than those recorded by FTs. This finding supports the use of UVCs and BCs over FTs for broad ecologically studies, especially when dealing with structurally complex habitats such as artificial structures.

The aim of the present work is to study the impact of the presence of a horizontal-axis three bladed turbine with the flow and a mobile sediment bed. We use a series of laboratory experiments with a scaled modelled turbine installed in a flume with a mobile sandy bed at the bottom. Acoustic instruments were used to monitor flow, suspended sediment and bed behaviour. Results show a velocity decrease of about 50% throughout the water column and no flow recovery after a distance of 15 rotor diameters. Clearly visible ripples in the absence of the model turbine were replaced by horseshoe-shaped scour pit in the near wake region, and a depositional heap in the far wake. Suspended sediment differences were recorded in the streamwise direction with a possible effect of the wake as far as 15 rotor diameters. These results imply potentially important effects on the efficiency of turbine arrays, if the flow were to be lower than expected, on turbine foundations and modify coastal sediment transport.

Floating lidar systems (FLS) are meant to replace an offshore met mast, being significantly cheaper and saving an essential part of project upfront investment costs. But at the same time, they need to overcome particular challenges-these are (1) the movement of the sea imparting motion on the buoy and the lidar, and the subsequent challenge of maintaining wind speed and direction accuracy, and (2) the remoteness of the deployed system in an extremely challenging environment necessitating robust, autonomous and reliable operation of measurement, power supply, data logging, and communication systems. The issue of motion influences was investigated in a number of studies and is to be checked and monitored in offshore trials of individual FLS realizations. In trials to date, such influences have been demonstrated to be negligibly or manageably small with the application of motion reduction or compensation strategies. Thereby, it is possible to achieve accurate wind measurement data from FLS. The second kind of challenge is tackled by implementing a sufficiently robust and reliable FLS design. Recommended practices collected by a working group within the International Energy Agency (IEA) Wind Task 32 and within the UK offshore wind accelerator program offer guidance for FLS design and configuration, and furthermore set requirements for trialing the system types and individual devices in representative offshore conditions.

To analyse the effect of ARSs deployment on local fish assemblages and to evaluate their effectiveness in terms of mean fishing yields and mean number of species caught, fishing surveys have been conducted over 14 years (256 net sets) using a gillnet to sample the ARS of Faro and Olhao and respective control sites. The fishing yields from the ARs continually exceeded those from the control sites, in both the mean number of species caught and the mean CPUE in weight (1.8-2.6 times); both were higher at Faro. Moreover, the comparison between fish assemblages from the ARS and respective control sites showed that the deployment of the man-made structures did not change the composition of the fish assemblages caught by the gill nets, or the equilibrium of the community, since the relative proportion of the different functional groups of fish remained stable. The ARSs are a useful management tool on the Algarve coast, enhancing and diversifying the catches, thus contributing to improved local artisanal fisheries, which play a major role in this region.",,,,,39th European Marine Biology Symposium39th European Marine Biology Symposium,"JUL 21-24, 2004JUL 21-24, 2004",Univ Genova; Italian Soc Marine BiolUniv Genova; Italian Soc Marine Biol,"Genoa, ITALYGenoa, ITALY",53,4,0,0,42,4,62,,,0018-8158,1573-5117,,,,,,,,,,"Ctr Reg Invest Pesqueira Sul, IPIMAR, P-8700305 Olhao, Portugal",Ctr Reg Invest Pesqueira Sul,,,2007-04-01,WOS:000245895800020,,

Part 1 focuses on supporting offshore hydrocarbon production, considering advances in understanding and designing the driven piles that support most continental shelf platforms, before moving to the large underwater landslides that can affect deeper water developments. Part 2 describes investigations into the geotechnical impact of climate change in a permafrost region and a peatland study that contributes to alleviating flood risks exacerbated by climate change. Part 3 outlines research that is improving the economics of renewable offshore wind energy for multi-pile and monopile supported turbines. Integrating geology and rigorous analysis with advanced laboratory and field experiments is shown to be essential to resolving the complex geotechnical problems considered, as is careful full-scale checking and monitoring.

To avoid these consequences designs must address one of the most severe loading scenarios: the crushing of level ice sheets against a structure. Unfortunately, the ability to accurately predict global effective pressures is impeded by the complexity of the ice crushing process. Ice crushing, and the resulting effective pressure, is influenced by a number of parameters. Currently, ISO 19906 provides an equation for engineers to use in predicting these pressures. This equation incorporates the consideration of the aspect ratio, region specific ice properties and the ice thickness. This paper uses the format of the ISO 19906 equation to provide an exploration into how ice-structure interaction parameters influence global effective pressures. Full-scale loading data, empirical studies and theory are utilized. Additionally, the scope of this study is limited to level ice interactions with vertical or near-vertical faced structures. The ISO 19906 equation is determined to provide a reasonable empirical consideration of aspect ratio effects. However, an improved ability to quantify the aspect ratio effect is thought to be achievable in the future. Freezing degree days (FDD) are shown to support variations in the relative severity of ice pressures across different regions and ice seasons. Still, further statistical support is required in order to associate FDD based ice strength coefficients with specific return periods. Lastly, a multivariate analysis of the ice thickness and temperature effect is conducted. The validity of a linear relationship with the inverse square root of the ice thickness (h(-0.5)) is strongly supported. Furthermore, it is strengthened when a linear relationship with measured temperatures is also considered.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,0,4,,,0165-232X,1872-7441,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calgary, Dept Civil Engn, Schulich Sch Engn, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",,,,2017-10-01,WOS:000410703500006,,

The AR global ranking index (ARMIr) and AR local effect index (ARMIe) include 16 metrics that represent four broad levels of the fish community: structure of fish assemblages, trophic structure, vulnerability and economic importance. Individual metrics were evaluated using a long-term dataset of fish assemblages from the AR and CA in northern Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Bottom gillnets were used to sample the fish two times per year for 21 years after creating the reef. The ARMIr general score for the AR was 51 out of a possible 100, with scores varying from 38 to 54. The ARMIr general score for the CA was 39 out of 100, with scores varying from 35 to 47. Average ARMIe values were 12% higher for the AR in relation to the CA. Spatial-temporal comparisons of the ARMIr using generalized additive models revealed significant differences between AR and CA. Evaluations of the ARMIe scores revealed that the assemblage structure and economic importance level significantly increased over time in the AR.

Hence, one major challenge for designers are to specify adequate toughness requirements at an early stage of the design process for low temperature applications. Both NORSOK N-004[1] and ISO 19902[2] provide requirements to load combinations that need to be fulfilled, however the relationship between various load types and temperature is not mentioned in any of these standards. Thus, in the design stage the material needs to demonstrate adequate toughness where loading and temperature are treated independently. For the offshore industry, the main question is the balance between materials requirements and cost-effective solutions, and how to address this within an overall design perspective in order to avoid brittle failure. This paper discusses some of these challenges with the aim of starting a focused process leading up to a clear interpretation of the implications of overall design philosophies, necessary in order to define consistent materials requirements ensuring that brittle fracture is not going to represent a significant threat to the structural integrity. The material recommendations provided in the paper are based on the latest research results from the Arctic Materials project (2008-2017) managed by SINTEF and supported by the industry.",,,,,"35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2016JUN 19-24, 2016","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4995-8,,,,,,,,,"DNV GL, Oslo, NorwaySTATOIL, Trondheim, Norway",STATOIL,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000393090700021,,

The interdependence of the decay in potential (phi) vs current density (i) conformed analytically to a straight line, the slope of which was the product of the total circuit resistance and cathode surface area and the vertical intercept of which was the anode corrosion potential. From experiments with resistor sizes ranging from 75 Ohm to 5,750 Ohm, a sigmoidal shape for the curve defining the relationship between long-term phi and i values for cathodically polarized steel in seawater was identified, with -1.00 V-SCE being the potential of minimum steady-state (maintenance) current density (i(m)). Evaluation of data from instrumented, newly deployed offshore structures and of survey data from older structures indicated that the phi-vs-i trend for these structures conformed to the same linear relationship as the laboratory specimens.

The properties of wind-generated (main) surface waves and currents are recognized to play a vital role during design of offshore structures such as windmills, fixed and floating structures. This study looks into the mechanisms of metocean forces, acting on these structures near the continental shelf region of Malaysia. At present, near offshore Malaysia, there is no real behaviour model available for currents and the interaction between waves and current. The free surface flow and rigid body interaction with structural issues of offshore structures such as fatigue, corrosion, and marine growth are also not researched in this region before. Therefore, current and wave-current models need to be developed using the finite volume method. Physics of these forces need to be determined and their free surface flow motions require the development of a framework. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is used to model the interfaces such as air-fluid (free surface) and fluid-structure (rigid-body). A Free-surface/rigid body problem fully coupled finite volume model is a preferred method. Six degree of freedom of motion equations are used to define the rigid body. This paper is based on literature review and the expected results due to the effects of wind on wave and currents and the mechanics of current are highlighted along with the seasonal effects of the current.

These artificial structures provide a number of ecological functions including habitat provision for epibenthic invertebrates and production of food and refuge for a variety of fish species. To mitigate the loss of habitat when active platforms are decommissioned, Rigs-to-Reefs programs maintain existing communities by removing the upper 26 m of platform structure and converting upper and lower portions into artificial reefs. We examined the epibenthic communities of two standing platforms at 5 m and 30 m depths and three reefed platforms at 30 m depths. A combination of stable isotope and community analysis was used to assess the structure and food web functioning of epibenthic communities among these site-types. Reefed platforms (30 m) supported communities with similar food web structure as 5 m and 30 in standing platform communities. However, community composition in standing platform and reefed platform sites at 30 m differed from those of standing platform sites at 5 m depths. Results indicate that, although loss of shallow water habitat associated with platform reefing may diminish some aspects of biodiversity, reefed platforms support similar fundamental ecological functions as standing platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.

To understand the consequences of changes in the structure of these assemblages, it is therefore necessary to determine which ecological processes are being affected and the factors influencing them. In Sydney Harbour, kelps on pier-pilings supported greater covers of bryozoans, particularly of the non-indigenous species Membranipora membranacea, than found on natural reefs. Experimental transplants of kelps without epibiota from reefs to pilings showed that recruitment and growth of colonies of M. membranacea were much greater on pilings than on reefs.

However, there are still important knowledge gaps to be addressed before biocontrol can be considered as a management tool. In a field experiment on floating marine structures we examined intra- and interspecific consumer interactions among biocontrol agents on different surface orientations. We tested the effect of identity, density and diversity of three invertebrates (the 11-arm seastar Coscinasterias muricata, the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus and the gastropod Cook's turban Cookia sulcata) to reduce established biofouling and to prevent fouling growth on defouled surfaces. High densities of biocontrol agents were not more effective at fouling control (cover and biomass) than low densities. Nor did multi-species treatments function more effectively than mono-specific ones. However, biocontrol agent identity was important, with the 11-arm seastar and Cook's turban being the most effective at fouling reduction and prevention, respectively. Surface orientation had a strong effect on the effectiveness of control agents, with the best results obtained on vertical compared to diagonal and underside surfaces. This study confirmed the potential of biocontrol as a management tool for marine pest, indicating that identity is more important than richness and density of control agents. It also highlighted the limitations of this approach on diagonal and underside surfaces, where control agents have limited retention ability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper is mainly work on a new design of float and the analytical analysis of its performance. This float consists of two parts; a hollow cylinder and an inverted cup fixed to its bottom. The float is initially submerged in water with sufficient submergence float. Water rises up due to the wave action and the float will follow the water motion which reduces slamming of the float.

Installations operating in the North Sea are primarily of welded construction and are subjected to severe environmental conditions, which induce significant fatigue loads. Thus, offshore installations are designed to resist structural failure from fatigue and extreme loading as well as other failure mechanisms, e.g., corrosion. Additionally, design to resist failure from accidental loading, such as fire and explosion and boat impact, is recognised as being particularly important. The need to maintain safety standards is of particular relevance on the United Kingdom continental shelf (UKCS) where there is an increasing ageing population of installations which have exceeded their original design lives and which subsequently require reassessment to ensure that structural integrity is maintained through the life cycle.The emphasis on safety highlights the need for appropriate structural integrity assessment procedures and the use of appropriate safety factors. A particularly important development has been the major international effort since 1993 to produce an ISO standard for offshore structures. This has entailed the harmonisation of relevant national codes and standards and the development of new procedures where appropriate, resulting in the derivation of revised safety factors for offshore structures.

In this work we present the results for the 3 platforms closest to the Italian coast. Aside the operational usage, the numerical outputs are also stored and adopted to compute statistics of the slick distributions in the coastal and marine areas of interest. The hazard was assessed by means of two different indices (Hazard Index and Occurrence Index) based on the operational system outputs, for the estimation of the hazard at sea (marine hazard or aerial hazard).

The artificial reef effect is important when constructing, for example, scour protections since it can generate an enhanced habitat. Specifically, artificial structures can create increased heterogeneity in the area important for species diversity and density. Offshore energy installations also have the positive side effect as they are a sanctuary area for trawled organisms. Higher survival of fish and bigger fish is an expected outcome that can contribute to a spillover to outer areas. One negative side effect is that invasive species can find new habitats in artificial reefs and thus influence the native habitats and their associated environment negatively. Different scour protections in offshore wind farms can create new habitats compensating for habitat loss by offshore energy installations. These created habitats differ from the lost habitat in species composition substantially. A positive reef effect is dependent on the nature and the location of the reef and the characteristics of the native populations. An increase in surface area of scour protections by using specially designed material can also support the reef effect and its productivity.",,,,,,,,,117,1,0,0,61,0,125,,,1537-744X,,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2012-01-01,WOS:000313183100001,23326215,

The GPDEM equation is solved to determine the evolution of probability distribution of fatigue damage in term of the loading cycles, and the probability distribution of the annual fatigue damage of mooring lines is evaluated through the combination of the GPDEM and the virtual stochastic process model. In addition, the system reliability assessment of the grid mooring system under fatigue limit state is performed by the equivalent extreme-value event method. The results indicate that the probability distribution of the fatigue damage of the mooring component becomes more asymmetrical and platykurtic with the increase of the loading cycle and the annual fatigue damage distribution of the components in the grid mooring system can be estimated by the GPDEM from a stochastic point of view without any approximations or any asymptotic distributions.

In contrast, on far offshore and strictly subtidal locations, such as shipwrecks and rocky reefs, only C. linearis was found. Based on these exploratory observations, we hypothesised that artificial structures that are only subtidal are inhabited exclusively by C. linearis, and never by C. mutica. To test this hypothesis and understand factors driving each species' habitat preferences, habitat suitability models were constructed using generalised additive models, based on samples collected in 2013-2015 from offshore gas platforms, buoys, shipwrecks, and rocky reefs and combined with data from other published and unpublished surveys (2001-2014). The models showed that the presence of C. mutica is explained by the availability of intertidal and floating hard substrates, suspended particulate matter density (SPM), mean annual sea surface temperature, salinity, and current velocity. The C. linearis model included subtidal hard substrates, SPM, salinity, temperature, and current velocity. The modelled distributions showed a significant difference, demonstrating that C. linearis' habitat preference does not fully overlap with that of C. mutica.

Using well-established meta-analytic methods, the overall effect size across all studies was calculated, and then changes in effect size for soft-bottom and complex-bottom oriented species were explored in association with several covariates including characteristics of the wind farm (depth, distance from shore, wind farm age), the sampling design (season, gear type, and distance from the turbine sampled), and ecosystem level characteristics (functional feeding group and fishing presence/absence). The overall effect size was positive and significantly different from zero, indicating greater abundance of fish inside of wind farms. Likewise, positive and significant effect sizes were noted for several covariates for both soft-bottom and complex-bottom species.

This work applies the theory of nonlinear normal modes to investigate the nonlinear vibrations of a discrete two-degree-of-freedom conceptual model of an offshore compliant articulated tower. The effects of buoyancy, added mass, ocean currents and waves are considered in the analysis. The elastic restoring forces are modeled, based on Augusti's model, using two orthogonal rotational springs. The invariant-manifold approach is then applied to the equations of motion, and the resulting equations are solved through an asymptotic expansion. The derived nonlinear normal modes are then used to reduce the problem to a single degree-of-freedom nonlinear oscillator in each mode. The stability of the solution is investigated through Floquet theory and Mathieu charts. Multiplicity of stable and unstable modes is detected using Poincare sections. Similar and non-similar modes are also identified. The results of the reduced order model are compared to the numerical solutions of the original equations of motion. The favorable comparisons between both solutions confirm that nonlinear normal modes are a good alternative for the nonlinear analysis of an articulated tower and similar offshore structures.

The aim Should be the broad public denial of poison application and to consistently call to account people who illegally Set Out poison, which may only be achieved by raising awareness and public relation activities. Lead intoxication: lead shot and bullet fragments were discussed as sources of lead intoxication in White-tailed Eagles. It was agreed that the removal of hunter shot carcasses and gut piles left in the field may help to mitigate the problem in the short term. However, the switch to nontoxic ammunition is essential for the protection of large raptors, but also for human health. Collisions and electrocution: the four subtopics dealt with at the workshop were (a) collisions with vehicles, (b) collisions with wires, (c) collisions with wind power plants and (d) electrocution. The inspection for carrion and mitigation of particular railway line sections, wire-marking, the prevention of power lines and wind turbines in hazardous areas as well as the legal prohibition of killer poles were considered of major importance. As a precautionary principle, potential settlement areas of large raptors should also be considered in terms of an ecological land use planning. Co-operations: national and international co-operations were considered favourable and important, as for instance the International Colour-ringing Pro, gramme, transnational surveys (e.g. synchronous winter censuses) and habitat protection in terms of a meta-population concept, joint public relation activities (e.g. concerning poisoning incidents) and regular international conferences or) the White-tailed Eagle.

In this paper, the Kalman Filter (extended) technique is explored in monitoring the health of a jacket structure, in a stochastic excited wave environment. Hydrodynamic coefficients drag (CD) and inertia (CM), usually experimentally obtained, are important parameters to assess the force on a structure using the Morison's equation. Usually these coefficients appearing in the force equation are unknown for majority of the slender offshore structures and are a priori obtained using some set of prototype experiments as these parameters depend on lot of factors (Keulegan-Carpenter number, roughness, dimensions and so on). Therefore, the recourse to parameter identification techniques based on Kalman filtering can be an alternative. In this paper, the problem is analysed using Airy wave theory where a cylinder is assumed to be fixed at the seabed. Numerical analysis is done to create experimental conditions to observe the dynamic response of the system. These numerical results are then plagued with white noise to represent the observations from experiments. These measurements are subsequently used in identification of the drag and inertia coefficients for the cylinder. This is presently attempted using the Extended Kalman Filter technique. With the use of this model the Extended Kalman Filter is shown to be able to identify time varying drag and inertia coefficients of the cylinder problem. For the present case, measurement sensors are placed for the measured force, along with the motions: velocity and acceleration. The above method can easily be implemented in jacket structures or similar offshore structures for attention due to increase in forces owing to marine growth.",,,,,"38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)","JUN 09-14, 2019JUN 09-14, 2019","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine EngnASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn","Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLANDUniv Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLAND",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2153-4772,,978-0-7918-5878-3,,,,,,,,,"Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Ocean Engn, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India",,,,2020-03-11,WOS:000513071100053,,

Two deteriorating structural system modeling approaches are illustrated and the pre-posterior and posterior updating of the structural system performance is formulated. To enhance the efficiency of the analysis of complex structural systems, a response surface method for load modeling is derived and the model uncertainty of the response surface is explicitly modeled. The formulated approaches are applied to a generic structural system and a typical deepwater jacket platform analyzing four SIRM scenarios. The optimal SIRM strategy is identified by maximizing the VoIA. The results show that the implementation of SIRM can reduce the failure risks and the expected total costs over the service life compared to a scenario without SIRM.

Marine animals in some modified habitats in Sydney Harbour provide experimental opportunities to test hypotheses to distinguish between direct and indirect processes. Covers of bryozoans and hydroids were greater on kelp growing on pilings than on kelp growing on natural reefs. The epifauna may be affected directly by the pilings or indirectly, i.e., the structure affects characteristics of the kelp which, in turn, influence covers of epifauna. Thus, differences in covers of epifauna on kelp can be due to: (1) factors associated with the primary habitats (pilings vs. reefs), (2) differences between characteristics of the kelp found in each habitat, or (3) an interaction between these factors (habitat and/or type of kelp).

In contrast, on far offshore and strictly subtidal locations, such as shipwrecks and rocky reefs, only C. linearis was found. Based on these exploratory observations, we hypothesised that artificial structures that are only subtidal are inhabited exclusively by C. linearis, and never by C. mutica. To test this hypothesis and understand factors driving each species habitat preferences, habitat suitability models were constructed using generalised additive models, based on samples collected in 2013-2015 from offshore gas platforms, buoys, shipwrecks, and rocky reefs and combined with data from other published and unpublished surveys (2001-2014). The models showed that the presence of C. mutica is explained by the availability of intertidal and floating hard substrates, suspended particulate matter density (SPM), mean annual sea surface temperature, salinity, and current velocity. The C. linearis model included subtidal hard substrates, SPM, salinity, temperature, and current velocity. The modelled distributions showed a significant difference, demonstrating that C. linearis habitat preference does not fully overlap with that of C. mutica. Thus, the native and alien Caprella species are likely to be able to co-exist in the North Sea. DATASETCSV containing raw sampling data including date and position, among others.

Information on how these communities develop and if and when these communities begin to resemble those on natural hard-bottom habitat is essential for marine management, but is not well understood. In this study, benthic communities on six breakwaters ranging from 1 to 31 years of age were compared to provide an understanding of patterns of community development on engineered coastal defenses, and these were compared to communities on natural reefs to gain an understanding of how communities develop on artificial structures relative to those in natural habitats. Multivariate analyses indicated that benthic communities on breakwaters became more similar to natural reefs with increasing age, but that communities on even the most mature (31 years) breakwater were distinct from those on natural reefs (ANOSIM p < 0.001). Generally, breakwaters <= 5.5 years had higher abundance of turf algae, sponges, bivalves, and bare pavement, while more mature (>= 25 years) breakwaters were dominated by corals. Coral cover on 25 and 31 years old breakwaters (46% and 56%, respectively) was significantly higher than on natural reefs (37%; HSD test p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). These results indicate that breakwaters develop benthic communities that continue to change over periods exceeding 31 years, and that although they become more similar to communities on natural reefs with increasing age, these communities remain distinct.

The UK, for example, has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. Suggested ways of reaching such a target are to increase dependency on offshore wind, offshore gas and nuclear. It is not clear, however, how the construction, operation and decommissioning of these energy systems will impact marine ecosystem services, i.e. the services obtained by people from the natural environment such as food provisioning, climate regulation and cultural inspiration. Research on ecosystem service impacts associated with offshore energy technologies is still in its infancy. The objective of this review is to bolster the evidence base by firstly, recording and describing the impacts of energy technologies at the marine ecosystems and human level in a consistent and transparent way; secondly, to translate these ecosystem and human impacts into ecosystem service impacts by using a framework to ensure consistency and comparability. The output of this process will be an objective synthesis of ecosystem service impacts comprehensive enough to cover different types of energy under the same analysis and to assist in informing how the provision of ecosystem services will change under different energy provisioning scenarios.Methods: Relevant studies will be sourced using publication databases and selected using a set of selection criteria including the identification of: (i) relevant subject populations such as marine and coastal species, marine habitat types and the general public; (ii) relevant exposure types including offshore wind farms, offshore oil and gas platforms and offshore structures connected with nuclear; (iii) relevant outcomes including changes in species structure and diversity; changes in benthic, demersal and pelagic habitats; and changes in cultural services.

Conversely, on reefs and seawalls, numbers of native species were up to three times greater than numbers of NIS. Differential recruitment to different positions and types of surfaces appeared to influence distribution patterns. NIS recruited well to most surfaces, particularly concrete surfaces near the surface of the water, whilst natives occurred infrequently on wooden surfaces. The position of rocky reefs and seawalls close to the shore and to the seabed appeared to make them favourable for the recruitment of natives, but this positioning alone does not hinder the recruitment of NIS. We argue that pontoons and pilings represent beachheads (i.e. entry points for invasion) for many nonindigenous epibiota and so enhance the spread and establishment of NIS in estuaries.

Coastal cities are typically located near estuaries, and we tested for potential impacts of these on ecological functions. Our study used 22 estuaries in eastern Australia as model systems to examine how urbanisation shapes the consumption of carrion by fish, a pivotal ecological function in estuaries. Fish assemblages varied among estuaries according to the extent of shoreline hardening, and this was correlated with changes in the rate of carrion consumption. In estuaries with low levels of shoreline hardening and abundant remnant mangroves, most carrion was consumed by toadfishes (Tetraodontidae). By contrast, in moderately urban estuaries (i.e. where 20-60% of shorelines had been hardened with artificial structures) yellowfin bream (Sparidae) replaced toadfish and performed the bulk of the scavenging function. Bream are particularly effective scavengers that utilize artificial structures as habitat for both foraging and sheltering. We show that by augmenting habitat for an important species of scavenger, the moderate addition of urban structures to estuarine shorelines also helped to supplement a key ecological function in estuaries.

Specifically, automations implementation and policy within legal documents drafted by American unions i.e. the International Longshoremens Association (ILA) and United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) are of utmost influence of fully autonomous implementation. Maritime automation targets various crane infrastructures, and full automation is defined as machinery completely devoid of human interaction. These central ideas of automation are paramount in both my technical project and research paper. My technical work focuses on additional opportunities for the Port of Virginia to combat oncoming fully autonomous operations. On the other hand, my research explores the implications behind policy regulation autonomous operations inside American ports. While my technical and research work approach automation in widely different fashions, the theme of furthering understanding of autonomous policy within the maritime industry is consistent within both. My technical work delves into a crane manufacturing venture within the Port of Virginia to further their impact on Virginian GDP and combat job loss due to automation. I propose investigating a crane manufacturing facility in the US, specifically Virginia Beach. My capstone team worked closely with Port of Virginia executives consulting them on various extensions to their 2065 Master Plan. Furthermore, we found prior research on wind turbine manufacturing at the Port of Virginia and used this process to draw our own parallels with crane manufacturing. Our goal is to offer a further understanding of emerging technologies, competing ports advancements, and the Port of Virginia overall. My STS research also explores automation, but rather than additional opportunities for ports, I investigate the written policy within the previous two master contracts (2012 & 2018) regulating East Coast Port automation. Beginning with explanations of American maritime unions and East/West Coast regulations, my research paper lays out a complex web of maritime checks and balances. I target policy on automation within master contracts drafted over the past decade between unions and ports. My claim is the East Coast Master Agreements policy on restricting autonomous operations within East Coast ports is moral because it embodies attributes of temperance, justice, and courage which are cardinal virtues of virtue ethics. In my research paper, I delve into an ethical analysis of maritime policy on automation with respect to these cardinal virtues. The goal of my research is to stimulate thought and offer an understanding of autonomous policy and operations from an ethical perspective. Working on both my technical and STS research projects greatly influenced the other. My technical paper expanded on the Port of Virginias ability to create jobs while also implementing up-to-date autonomous infrastructure. My STS paper similarly provided additional insight into autonomous policy dictating American ports ability to implement autonomous infrastructure. Both papers themes further readers understanding of how automation is handled within American ports and furthermore offer an alternative perspective on the maritime industry. In summary, working on both research and technical papers allowed me to tackle automation from several angles and time periods to fully understand how modern ports can approach automation policy and infrastructure in the future acknowledging social implications and ethical reasoning.

In light of the potential environmental impacts of this, such as habitat loss and alteration, it is becoming increasingly important to incorporate ecologically-sensitive design into artificial marine structures. The principles of eco-engineering and green infrastructure are embedded in urban planning practice for terrestrial and freshwater development projects. In marine planning, however, eco-engineering of blue-green infrastructure remains an emerging concept. This note provides a UK perspective on the progress towards uptake of eco-engineering approaches for enhancing biodiversity on artificial marine structures. We emphasise that, despite a clear 'policy pull' to incorporate biodiversity enhancements in marine structures, a range of proof-of-concept evidence that it is possible to achieve, and strong cross-sectoral stakeholder support, there are still few examples of truly and purposefully designed blue-green artificial structures in the UK. We discuss the barriers that remain and propose a strategy towards effective implementation. Our strategy outlines a step-wise approach to: (1) strengthening the evidence base for what enhancements can be achieved in different scenarios; (2) improving clarity on the predicted benefits and associated costs of enhancements; (3) packaging the evidence in a useful form to support planning and decision-making; and (4) encouraging implementation as routine practice.

The nonlinear analysis of offshore platform subjected to extreme wave induced forces can play a major role in the design of the offshore structures.

A finite element model is employed to determine the stresses and displacements in a steel jacket under combined structural and wave loadings. Wave plus current kinematics are generated using 5th order Stokes wave theory. The horizontal components of the wave velocity and acceleration fields are multiplied by a wave kinematics factor that is intended to account for direction spreading and irregularity of the wave profile. The wave and current forces acting on the member is computed using Morison's equation, which decomposes the total force into an inertia component and a drag component. The response of fixed offshore structure together with the distribution of displacement, axial force and bending moment along the leg are investigated for regular and extreme conditions, where the structure should keep production capability in conditions of the 1-yr return period wave and must be able to survive for 100-yr return period storm conditions.

J,"Sansom, A.; Evans, R.; Roos, S.",,,,,,,,,,Population and future range modelling of reintroduced Scottish white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla).,,,,,,,,Scottish Natural Heritage Commissioned Report,,,,898,,,,I,"iv, 1-55",,,,,,,,,,,Article,2016,2016,"Background Re-introductions are increasingly being used in conservation biology as a valuable tool in species recovery programmes. This technique was used to establish a population of whitetailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) in Scotland, where the species went extinct in 1917. Three release phases have taken place, of which the first two (1975-1985 and 1993-1998) were on the west coast and the third (2007-2012) on the east coast of Scotland. All three phases have used birds sourced from Norway. In 2014, there were 98 territorial pairs of white-tailed eagles in Scotland, of which 90 were confirmed to have bred. For this report, a conservative approach was used, and only the 90 sites with confirmed nests were considered territories. Overall, the re-introduction programme has been deemed a conservation success; however, the species may potentially come into conflict with land-use interests, including sheep farming, forestry and renewable energy. Therefore it is important to get a better understanding of how fast the population of white-tailed eagles will increase numerically and where the population will expand into. This is important for both mediating conflicts and for predicting how white-tailed eagles might be affected by other land-uses, such as forestry and renewable energy production (e.g. wind farms). There are also concerns that white-tailed eagles might be victims of persecution, but the impact of such illegal activity on the whitetailed eagle population is currently unknown. The best available predictions of future population increase used data on breeding success and age-specific survival up to and including 2007. This report presents predicted population growth using estimates of breeding success and survival up to 2014. Additional mortality, potentially caused by illegal killing or collisions with wind turbines, was also incorporated in some modelled scenarios. Finally, models of predicted geographical range expansion in the next 25 years (i.e. up to and including the year 2040) are presented, based on habitat associations and nearest-neighbour distances. Main findings The number of breeding white-tailed eagle pairs has continued to grow almost exponentially, and wild-bred eagles now greatly outnumber released eagles. There has been a continued increase in both the proportion of white-tailed eagle nests fledging young (i.e. breeding success) and the number of chicks fledged per breeding attempt (i.e. productivity) since the first breeding attempt in 1983. This is probably because the proportion of birds in the population with extensive breeding experience has increased, as breeding performance improves with experience. However, since 2006, the number of chicks fledged per breeding attempt appears to have remained relatively constant at an average of 0.67 chicks fledged per territorial pair. When the updated estimates of breeding success and age-specific survival were used in density-independent predictive models, the results suggest that the white-tailed eagle population could continue to grow to over 200 pairs by 2025 and almost 900 pairs by 2040, but obviously the long-term predictions are far less certain than the short-term. When modelling the impact of additional mortality, potentially caused by illegal killing and collisions with wind farms, population growth was reduced, but not to the extent of causing a population decline. Overall, the results presented here suggest a continued exponential population growth of white-tailed eagles in Scotland in the short-term. However, density-dependence in demographic rates would need to be considered in modelling population growth over the longer term. The associations between white-tailed eagle breeding sites and habitat, landscape and topographical variables were explored statistically by comparing the locations of real nest sites and random points in the landscape. The final model suggested that white-tailed eagles were positively associated with length of coastline, area of inland water and the area of forest (all within 1 km from the nest) and also with flat topography (within 3 km from the nest). This model explained 25% of the variation in occupancy status. Information on how far away from existing pairs new white-tailed eagle pairs settle was compiled, and it was found that most newly established territories were located between 6 and 10 km from the nearest other active white-tailed eagle nest. By integrating eaglehabitat associations and the nearest-neighbour distances for newly established pairs, future range expansion was modelled spatially. The results suggested that range expansion is most likely to occur mainly along the west coast of Scotland, the Great Glen and in central and eastern Scotland where birds from the east coast release start to breed. The geographical range expansion models presented in this report can inform stakeholders of likely white-tailed eagle range expansion in the next 10-25 years, but the exact settlement order is difficult to predict. In addition, occasional long-distance dispersal events could lead to the establishment of new pairs outside the range predicted here. In the long-term, these pairs might result in new population centres, which could expand the geographical range of white-tailed eagles even further.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,1759-4014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-06-29,ZOOREC:ZOOR15307045792,,

A 5.8 m diameter monopile foundation was installed at the case study offshore windfarm approximately 30 m ahead of an approaching barchan (crescent-shaped) dune. The impact of the monopile on the dune's evolution was analysed using six multibeam bathymetry surveys spanning 20 years. To substantiate this analysis, coupled three-dimensional numerical modelling of flows and sediment was conducted in which the scour inducing bed shear stresses were calculated from the modelled turbulent kinetic energy. Following the installation of the monopile, the mid-section of the dune accelerated and stretched in the direction of the wake of the monopile. Four years after the monopile's installation the rest of the dune had caught up, flattening out the slip face within half the dune's length downstream of the monopile. Due to the modified flow field, the dune was scoured deeply at the base of the monopile to a depth of 6.8 m (supported by the model results that predicted a scour depth exceeding 2 m over a period of just a few days). The surveyed volume of material scoured amounted to 8% of the total dune volume. Whilst the process of scouring occurs at a timescale of days to weeks, the dune migrated on average by 25 m/yr. The difference in the timescale of the two processes allowed the scouring to occur through the full thickness of the dune. The scoured dune profile recovered rapidly once the dune migrated downstream of the monopile. This article demonstrates how large geomorphological features can intercept and migrate past a monopile foundation without long-lasting impacts on the integrity of the feature or the foundation.

Species richness was greater at mid than upper tidal levels, particularly in artificial habitats. Rock pools supported greater species richness than emergent substrata, and this difference was more pronounced in artificial than natural habitats. Rock pools in artificial habitats supported greater species richness at mid than upper tidal levels.Main conclusions Artificial structures support lower biodiversity than natural habitats. This is primarily due to the lack of habitat heterogeneity in artificial habitats. Artificial structures can be modified to provide rock pools that promote biodiversity. The effect of rock pool creation will be more pronounced at mid than upper tidal levels. The challenge now is to establish at what tidal height the effect of pools becomes negligible and to determine the rock pool dimensions for optimum habitat enhancement.",,,,,,,,,143,0,0,0,116,0,148,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Ryan Inst, Galway, IrelandBangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, WalesUniv Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandUniv Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, EnglandUniv Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England",,,,2013-10-01,WOS:000324019000006,,

However, spatial heterogeneity is not static and it can change along temporal scales. These changes, whether gradual or rapid, have the potential of forcing species extinctions or facilitating the introduction of nonnative species. Here, we present modeling results that show how changes in spatial heterogeneity over several generations can produce strong changes in benthic species composition residing in eastern Long Island Sound, USA. For many benthic species, hard substrate is a limiting resource which can vary in availability among different coastal areas. We modeled gradual changes from a heterogeneous landscape (mimicking patches of natural hard and soft substrate) to a homogenous one (analogous to a fully developed coast with hard, manmade substrate) and followed the abundance and distribution patterns of species possessing four different life histories. We also modeled changes from homogeneous to heterogeneous landscapes. We found that as regions become more homogeneous, species extinctions become more frequent and poor dispersers dominate locally. In contrast, as habitats become more heterogeneous, species distributing across localities leads to regional species coexistence and fewer extinctions. These results suggest that focusing on changing habitat heterogeneity can be a useful management strategy to prevent poor dispersing species, such as invasive ascidians, from driving communities to monocultures.",,,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,18,1,31,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USAUniv Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USAUniv New Haven, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, West Haven, CT 06516 USAUniv Texas Austin, Inst Marine Sci, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA",,,,2011-06-03,WOS:000290661300023,21639055,

A cofferdam is a temporary barrier to stop the inflow of water in the construction site and allows working in the dry condition when the construction is done within the water. However, it is a major cause of construction delays and increased costs because additional works are required to block the water inflow. Recently, in order to overcome the limitations of the conventional cofferdam methods and to increase economic efficiency, a large-diameter steel cofferdam method has been proposed which can be installed quickly in the seabed by using the suction pressure. In this circular steel cofferdam method, the top side of the cofferdam including the top-lid is always exposed above the sea level in order to use it as a water barrier, unlike the conventional suction bucket foundation. After installation, the top-lid of the cofferdam is removed and the water filled inside the cofferdam is discharged to make the interior dry condition. In this study, the circular steel cofferdam with a 5 m inner diameter was fabricated and the installation tests were conducted at the Saemaguem test site. During the experiment, variation of suction pressure, leakage between connections, structure deformation, and inclination of the steel cofferdam were measured and post-analyzed. This study verified the new circular steel cofferdam method and confirmed that the suction installation method can be successfully used for various purposes on offshore structures.",,,,"해상(또는 수상) 구조물 시공수요가 증가됨에 따라 해양구조물 시공을 용이하게 하는 임시구조물 수요가 증가하고 있다. 가물막이(cofferdam)는 임시구조물로 해상 작업 시 외부로부터 물을 막아 육상과 동일한 작업환경을 제공한다. 하지만, 물 유입을 차단하기 위한 별도의 시공공정이 필요하기 때문에 공사지연과 건설비 증가의 주원인이 되고 있다. 최근 재래식 가물막이의 문제점을 해결하고 경제성을 높이기 위해 석션압(suction pressure)을 이용해 신속하고 경제적으로 시공이 가능한 대구경 원형강관 가물막이 공법이 제안되었다. 본 공법은 원형강관 가물막이 상부가 수면위로 노출된 상태에서 석션압을 이용해 해저면에 관입되고, 시공 후 내부의 물을 외부로 배출하여 강관자체를 가물막이로 활용한다. 본 연구에서는 원형강관 가물막이 공법을 검증하기 위해 직경 5m인 원형강관 가물막이를 제작하고 새만금 지역에서 실증실험을 실시하였다. 실험 중 원형 강관에 작용하는 석션압, 연결부 누수유무, 수직도(경사도), 구조체의 변형을 각각 계측하였으며 실험결과를 분석하였다. 본 연구를 통해 석션압을 이용한 원형강관 가물막이 공법을 검증하였으며, 석션 설치공법이 다양한 해양 구조물 시공에 활용 될 수 있음을 확인하였다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1229-2427,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-06-22,KJD:ART002638427,,

It affects the life of process equipment and pipelines, and can result in structural failure, leakage, product loss, environmental pollution and the loss of life. Pitting corrosion is regarded as one of the most hazardous forms of corrosion for marine and offshore structures. The total loss of the structure might be very small, but local rate of attack can be very large and can lead to early catastrophic failure. Pitting corrosion is a localized accelerated dissolution of metal that occurs as a result of a breakdown in the protective passive film on the metal surface. It has been studied for many years; however, the structural failure due to pit characteristics is still not fully understood. Accurate pit depth measurements, precise strength assessment techniques, risk analysis due to pitting, and the mathematical relationship of the environmental factors that causes pitting failure are also factors, which need further understanding. Hence this paper focuses on these issues. It reviews and analyses the current understanding of the pitting corrosion mechanism and investigates all possible factors that can cause pitting corrosion. Furthermore, different techniques employed by scientists and researchers to identify and model the pitting corrosion are also reviewed and analysed. Future work should involve an in-depth scientific study of the corrosion mechanism and an engineering predictive model is recommended in order to assess failure, and thereby attempt to increase the remaining life of offshore assets.

Where invaders are able to disperse from artificial habitats, their impact may spread to surrounding natural communities and therefore it is important to investigate potential factors that reduce or enhance invasibility. We surveyed the distribution of non-indigenous and native invertebrates and algae between artificial habitats and natural reefs in a marine subtidal system. We also deployed sandstone plates as experimental reefs and manipulated the orientation, starting assemblage and degree of shading. Invertebrates (non-indigenous and native) appeared to be responding to similar environmental factors (e.g. orientation) and occupied most space on artificial structures and to a lesser extent reef walls. Non-indigenous invertebrates are less successful than native invertebrates on horizontal reefs despite functional similarities. Manipulative experiments revealed that even when non-indigenous invertebrates invade vertical reefs, they are unlikely to gain a foothold and never exceed covers of native invertebrates (regardless of space availability). Community ecology suggests that invertebrates will dominate reef walls and algae horizontal reefs due to functional differences, however our surveys revealed that native algae dominate both vertical and horizontal reefs in shallow estuarine systems. Few non-indigenous algae were sampled in the study, however where invasive algal species are present in a system, they may present a threat to reef communities. Our findings suggest that non-indigenous species are less successful at occupying space on reef compared to artificial structures, and manipulations of biotic and abiotic conditions (primarily orientation and to a lesser extent biotic resistance) on experimental reefs explained a large portion of this variation, however they could not fully explain the magnitude of differences.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2013-08-31,DRCI:DATA2013078003561109,,

This topic has received significant attention from the research community, producing many estimations of Europe's onshore wind potential for capacity and generation. Despite this focus, previous estimates appear to have underpredicted both the amount of available future wind capacity as well as its performance. Foremost in this regard is the common use of contemporary, or at least near-future, turbine designs which are not fitting for a far-future context. In response to this, an improved, transparent, and fully reproducible work flow is presented here, and applied to determine a future-oriented onshore wind energy potential for Europe. Within a scenario of turbine cost and design in 2050, 13.4 TW of capacity is found to be available, allowing for 34.3 PWh of average generation per year. By sorting the explicitly-placed potential installation locations by their expected generation cost, national relationships between cost and performance versus installed capacity are found, and it is also seen that all countries possess some potential for onshore wind energy generation below 4 ct(sic)Wh(-1). Furthermore, it is unlikely for these costs to exceed 6 ct(sic)Wh(-1) in any future capacity scenario. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in order to be cost effective the inspection must be carried out in situ, and this poses significant safety risks if undertaken manually.

Clear evidence of any ecological consequences will inform the design and placement of structures to either minimise negative impacts or enhance ecosystem restoration. The development of rapid, cost-effective and reliable remote underwater monitoring methods is crucial to supporting evidence-based decision-making by planning authorities and developers when assessing environmental risks and benefits of offshore structures.

Apart from the environmental loads, offshore structures in Arctic region will also be subjected to impact forces arising due to ship platform collision. Such loads may endanger the safety of the platform due to the combined effect of reduced temperature and impact forces on the material and geometric properties of the structure. Thus, there is a need to understand the behaviour of offshore structures under impact forces in low-temperature conditions. Offshore Triceratops is one of the recent new-generation compliant platforms proved to be suitable for ultra-deepwater applications. The main aim of this study is to assess the response of triceratops under impact forces in Arctic environment numerically. As the buoyant legs of triceratops are susceptible to impact forces arising from ship platform collision, the numerical model of a buoyant leg is developed using Ansys explicit dynamics solver. The impact analyses is then carried out with rectangular box-shaped indenter representing the stem of a ship, under both ambient conditions and Arctic temperature (- 60 degrees C) and the local response of the platform is studied through force deformation curves and stress contours. In order to study the global response of the platform, the numerical model of triceratops is developed in Ansys Aqwa solver and analysed under the action of impact load time history obtained from explicit analysis of buoyant leg. The impact load on the buoyant leg resulted in the continuous periodic vibration of the platform. Furthermore, parametric studies were also carried out to investigate the effect of indenter velocity, size, and location on the impact response of triceratops under Arctic temperature, and the results are discussed.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,0,22,,,1598-2351,2093-6311,,,,,,,,,,"IIT Madras, Dept Ocean Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",,,,2019-11-18,WOS:000494403500001,,

The reef fish data were collected using the Underwater Visual Census in 3 meters depth on each station. There were 87 species of reef fishes found in the Ulee Lheue water.

To identify all targets, time and cost consuming campaigns are necessary. The clearance of UXO is often limited by time due to the idea that UXO can migrate on the sea floor. Therefore the UXO-measure has to be revisited in some cases before installation or repair. Thus it might be possible, that additional UXO-measures are necessary before starting any operations touching the seabed. Insofar a better understanding of the migration of objects on the sea floor may help to improve currently used methods of time-dependent clearance by more knowledge-based decisions. The aim of this study is to investigate the requirements of initial movement of objects on the sea floor. This has been done by the analysis of literature, previous investigation to scour and burial of such objects, wind-tunnel experiments as well as experiments in a water channel. Additionally, numerical simulations allowed comparisons, combinations and a generalization of experimental results. A new mathematical model developed and validated allows a prediction of the incident fluid velocity that is necessary for an inertial motion of defined cylindrical and spherical objects. This model allows a reliable prediction of the initial migration of objects on a sandy sea floor. It is based on physical parameters, which depend on predictable and measurable events like currents, tides and indirectly on the weather conditions.",,,,,Oceans Aberdeen ConferenceOceans Aberdeen Conference,"JUN 19-22, 2017JUN 19-22, 2017",,"Aberdeen, ENGLANDAberdeen, ENGLAND",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0197-7385,,978-1-5090-5278-3,,,,,,,,,"Univ Rostock, Chair Ocean Engn, Albert Einstein Str 2, D-18051 Rostock, Germany",,,,2018-04-03,WOS:000426997002016,,

The current approach to risk governance is evaluated to assess how it can handle the uncertain, complex, and/or ambiguous risks of multi-use. It is concluded that current risk governance for multi-use is poorly equipped to deal with the systemic nature of risks. Risk governance should be a joint effort of governments and private regulators. It can improve if it is based on an adaptive framework for risk assessment that can deal with complex, systemic risks.

Excluding sites from the portfolio has nonlinear impacts on the profitability of the portfolio of sites in that areas excluded from consideration have greater impacts on profit if they are grouped together or aligned parallel to the prevailing wind direction.

Majewski, University of Virginia Main Campus AST-1009973, James Bullock, University of California-Irvine This is a comprehensive study of the formation and evolution of the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of Andromeda (M31). These satellites within the Local Group include the least luminous galaxies known and they can be explored to test ideas about star formation in the smallest dark matter halos and at the earliest times. Extensive data sets on the resolved stellar populations of M31 satellites are combined with state-of-the-art galaxy models in order to learn how the dynamical -, merger -, assembly -, star formation -, and chemical enrichment histories of the current and past M31 satellite systems fit together in the context of the general paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation. The data for M31 are compared to the satellites and halo population of the Milky Way galaxy for which were previously studied by the investigators. The Milky Way and M31 are both spiral galaxies but have different populations of satellite galaxies for which an explanations needs to be found. The additional data for M31 are important for evaluating solutions to the ?missing satellites problem? in Lambda-Cold Dark Matter (CDM) simulations, where the number of subhalos is predicted to be higher than the number of observed satellites. So far the Milky Way is the only system for which the comparison to models can be made which will change when the results of this study are available. The three principal investigators have a standing collaboration and they have initiated the SPLASH (Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo) survey with previous support from the NSF. The methods and techniques used here are well established in this collaboration. The SPLASH survey uses the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) on the Keck II telescope and the 4-m telescope with Mosaic CCD wide field Imager at Kitt Peak National Observatory. The survey extends to study red giant branch stars in more satellite galaxies of the Andromeda system. The group has already 139 DEIMOS masks (about 20,000 spectra) and spectroscopy of M31 red giant candidates selected from the imaging data. The goal is to observe another 135 DEIMOS masks to obtain spectra of more than 100 member red giant stars in each of the known and any newly found dSph satellites of M31. Further spectra are thought for about 3,000 stars in M33, a low-luminosity disk satellite interacting with M31; and about 1,000 stars in the NE shelf which is tidal debris from a past M31 satellite associated with the Giant Southern Stream in M31. One part of the work combines spectral and photometric diagnostics to isolate M31 red giants efficiently. Further there are measurements of precision stellar velocities to derive velocity dispersions in dwarf galaxies and tidal streams, which are both kinematically cold subsystems. Measurements of elemental abundances from moderate resolution co-added spectra tare used o constrain the chemical enrichment/star formation histories of M31 satellites. Theoretical models are used to determine the dark matter mass of each dwarf satellite galaxy in M31 to place the observations within a cosmological framework. This will give more data to decipher how the evolution of the Milky Way and M31 can be described in the context of Lambda-CDM cosmology. This work provides another data set for a galaxy system to test Lambda-CDM cosmologies. This will have a broad impact on other fields. The DEIMOS-derived chemical abundances are of interest for stellar population studies community. The new analytical methods developed here provide a foundation for similar studies of resolved stars in other stellar systems, including more distant galaxies to be targeted with the next generation of telescopes. Undergraduate students are participating in the research activities and graduate students work on parts of this project for their theses. This will help to train the next generation of scientists. The researchers make efforts to speak in K-12 classrooms and to reach out to underrepresented high-school and undergraduate students.

To assist this effort in Rhode Island, benthic habitat classification maps were developed for two sites in offshore waters being considered for wind turbine installation. Maps characterizing and representing the distribution and extent of benthic habitats are valuable tools for improving understanding of ecosystem patterns and processes, and promoting scientifically-sound management decisions. This project presented the opportunity to conduct a comparison of the methodologies and resulting map outputs of two classification approaches, top-down and bottom-up in the two study areas.This comparison was undertaken to improve understanding of mapping methodologies and their applicability, including the bottom-up approach in offshore environments where data density tends to be lower, as well as to provide case studies for scientists and managers to consider for their own areas of interest. Such case studies can offer guidance for future work for assessing methodologies and translating them to other areas.The traditional top-down mapping approach identifies biological community patterns based on communities occurring within geologically defined habitat map units, under the concept that geologic environments contain distinct biological assemblages. Alternatively, the bottom-up approach aims to establish habitat map units centered on biological similarity and then uses statistics to identify relationships with associated environmental parameters and determine habitat boundaries. When applied to the two study areas, both mapping approaches produced habitat classes with distinct macrofaunal assemblages and each established statistically strong and significant biotic abiotic relationships with geologic features, sediment characteristics, water depth, and/or habitat heterogeneity over various spatial scales. The approaches were also able to integrate various data at differing spatial resolutions. The classification outputs exhibited similar results, including the number of habitat classes generated, the number of species defining the classes, the level of distinction of the biological communities, and dominance by tube-building amphipods. These results indicate that both approaches are able to discern a comparable degree of habitat variability and produce cohesive macrofaunal assemblages. The mapping approaches identify broadly similar benthic habitats at the two study sites and methods were able to distinguish the differing levels of heterogeneity between them.The top-down approach to habitat classification was faster and simpler to accomplish with the data available in this study when compared to the bottom-up approach. Additionally, the top-down approach generated full-coverage habitat classes that are clearly delineated and can easily be interpreted by the map user, which is desirable from a management perspective for providing a more complete assessment of the areas of interest. However, a higher level of biological variability was noted in some of the habitat classes created, indicating that the biological communities present in this area are influenced by factors not captured in the broad-scale geological habitat units used in this approach.The bottom-up approach was valuable in its ability to more clearly define macrofaunal assemblages among habitats, discern finer-scale habitat characteristics, and directly assess the degree of macrofaunal assemblage variability captured by the environmental parameters. From a user perspective, the map is more complex, which may be perceived as a limitation, though likely reflects natural gradations in habitat structure and likely presents a more ecologically realistic portrayal of the study areas. Though more comprehensive, the bottom-up approach in this study was limited by the reliance on full-coverage data to create full-coverage habitat classes. Such classes could only be developed when sediment data was excluded, since this point-sample dataset could not be interpolated due to high spatial heterogeneity of the study areas. Given a higher density of bottom samples, this issue could be rectified.While the top-down approach was more appropriate for this study, both approaches were found to be suitable for mapping and classifying benthic habitats. In the United States, objectives for mapping and classification for renewable energy development have not been well established. Therefore, at this time, the best-suited approach primarily depends on mapping objectives, resource availability, data quality and coverage, and geographical location, as these factors impact the types of data included, the analyses and modeling that can be performed, and the biotic-abiotic relationships identified.

These windmill artificial reefs (WARs) harbour high abundances of fish species which can be attracted from elsewhere or can be the result of extra production induced by these wind farms. To resolve the attraction-production debate in suddenly altered ecosystems (cf. wind farms), the possible consequences of attraction should be assessed; thereby bearing in mind that ecological traps may arise. In this paper we investigated whether the wind farms in the Belgian part of the North Sea act as ecological traps for pouting and Atlantic cod. Length-at-age, condition and diet composition of fish present at the windmill artificial reefs was compared to local and regional sandy areas.Fish data from the period 2009-2012 were evaluated. Mainly I- and II-group Atlantic cod were present around the WARs; while the 0- and I-group dominated for pouting. For Atlantic cod, no differences in length were observed between sites, indicating that fitness was comparable at the WARs and in sandy areas. No significant differences in condition index were observed for pouting. At the WARs, they were slightly larger and stomach fullness was enhanced compared to the surrounding sandy areas. Also diet differed considerably among the sites. The outcome of the proxies indicate that fitness of pouting was slightly enhanced compared to the surrounding sandy areas. No evidence was obtained supporting the hypothesis that the WARs act as an ecological trap for Atlantic cod and pouting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Tests were undertaken using several combinations of pile diameter (D = 0.1 and 0.2 m) and mean flow velocity ((u(0)) over bar = 0.08-0.24 m/s), representing typical prototype conditions at a scale of 1:50. It is shown that turbulence can be predicted using the distance downstream (x) and off axis (y), the pile diameter, and the mean flow velocity. Two new parameters are introduced to simplify assessment of proposed structures. Relative Excess Turbulence (RET) is the extra turbulence generated by the pile, normalised by the ambient turbulence. Turbulence Recovery Length scale (TRL) is the distance downstream (normalised by D) required for RET to fall below a given threshold. Results show that RET decays exponentially with distance downstream. Across the wake, RET fitted a Gaussian function with peak values at the wake centreline.

In environments where long piles are not suitable, structures will use foundations with very low aspect ratios such as skirts and mats. Capacity of long piles has been studied for decades and is well documented, whilst more recent tests have also addressed the behaviour of skirts, mats, and other low-aspect ratio foundations. The vertical and lateral capacity of mid-size foundations, with aspect ratios between one and five, has generally been thought too low for the requirements of most offshore structures. However, in recent years, structures of increasingly different shapes and sizes have been used in offshore environments, such as water-based renewable energy sources or marginal oil and gas platforms. In many of these cases, the usage of a low aspect ratio foundation could significantly reduce installation and transportation costs. Limited studies have been performed on such foundations, and most of the existing work uses only analytical and numerical solutions. Geotechnical centrifuge tests and corresponding numerical analyses were started at Texas A&M University and were continued at the University of Cambridge on the lateral capacity of piles with an aspect ratio of two in normally consolidated clay. Piles were loaded under both pure rotation and a mix of rotation and translation. This work is relevant to offshore structures requiring foundations that are strong but easily installed and cost-efficient, specifically structures secured with piles that experience point loads either through or above the water.

Under such harsh environmental conditions, special offshore structures called articulated structures are feasible owing to reduced structural weight. Whereas, conventional offshore structure requires huge physical dimensions to meet the desired strength and stability criteria, therefore, are uneconomical. Articulated offshore towers are among the compliant offshore structures. These structures consist of a ballast chamber near the bottom hinge and a buoyancy chamber just below the mean sea level, imparting controlled movement against the environmental loads (wave, currents, and wind/earthquake). The present study deals with the seismic compliance of a double-hinged articulated offshore tower to three real earthquakes by solving the governing equations of motion in time domain using Newmark's-beta technique. For this purpose Elcentro 1940, Taft 1952 and Northridge 1994 earthquake time histories are considered. The tower is modeled as an upright flexible pendulum supported to the sea-bed by a mass-less rotational spring of zero stiffness while the top of it rigidly supports a deck in the air (a concentrated mass above water level). The computation of seismic and hydrodynamic loads are performed by dividing the tower into finite elements with masses lumped at the nodes. The earthquake response is carried out by random vibration analysis, in which, seismic excitations are assumed to be a broadband stationary process. Effects of horizontal ground motions are considered in the present study. Monte Carlo simulation technique is used to model long crested random wave forces. Effect of sea-bed shaking on hydrodynamic modeling is considered. The dynamic equation of motion is formulated using Lagrangian approach, which is based on energy principle. Nonlinearities due to variable submergence and buoyancy, added mass associated with the geometrical non-linearities of the system are considered. The results arc expressed in the form of time-histories and PSDFs of deck displacement, rotational angle, base and hinge shear, and the bending moment. The outcome of the response establishes that seismic sea environment is an important design consideration for successful performance of hinges, particularly, if these structures are situated in seismically active zones of the world's ocean.",,,,,27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering,"JUN 15-20, 2008JUN 15-20, 2008","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Estoril, PORTUGALEstoril, PORTUGAL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4818-0,,,,,,,,,"Jamia Millia Islamia, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi 110025, India",,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000263875900078,,

Here we examined species biodiversity, composition and habitat type surrounding a tidal energy device within the European Marine Energy Centre test site, Orkney. Commercial fishing and towed video camera techniques were used over three temporal periods, from 2009 to 2010.Our results showed increased species biodiversity and compositional differences within the device site, compared to a control site. Both sites largely comprised of crustacean species, omnivore or predatory feeding regimes and marine tide-swept EUNIS habitat types, which varied over the time. We conclude that the device could act as a localised artificial reef structure, but that further in-depth investigations are required. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Such towers are very sensitive to the dynamic effects of wind and wind generated waves. The exposed superstructure is subjected to aerodynamic loads while the submerged substructure is subjected to hydrodynamic loads. Articulated towers are designed such that their fundamental frequency is well below the wave frequency to avoid dynamic amplification. Dynamic interaction of these towers with environmental loads (wind, waves and currents) acts to impart a lesser overall shear and overturning moment due to compliance to such forces. This compliancy introduces geometric nonlinearity due to large displacements, which becomes an important consideration in the analysis of articulated towers. Prediction of the nonlinear behaviour of these towers in the harsh ocean environment is difficult. However, simplified realistic mathematical models are employed to gain an important insight into the problem and to explore the dynamic behaviour.

Since only a few studies of the effects on fish or fish communities have so far been made in this context, there are great gaps in the relevant scientific knowledge. The findings have moreover been confined to small installations, and are thus hardly transferable to the much larger projects that are now being proposed. One is thus reduced to leaning on indirect assessments of the possible effects. It may be assumed, on the basis of common biological knowledge, that the the following types of environmental disturbances could occur, and affect the fish community or certain fish species, during the construction and operation of the farms and their eventual dismantling - deterioration of water quality (by sediment or oil spills or through increased turbidity) - changes in habitats - noise and vibration - unusual light and reflections - electromagnetic fields from direct-current cables The three last mentioned physical disturbances act directly on the sense organs of fish and thus affects such vital functions as communication, spawning, migration, and foraging. There may also be synergistic effects, and in addition to the biological ones, some economic consequences in the way of bans on anchoring and fishing.

In response, there is a growing interest in ecological engineering these structures for the benefit of both nature and humankind. Since the decision to build or adapt coastal infrastructure is a socio-economic one, the views and perceptions of different users are likely to influence support for ecological engineering projects. A survey was developed and run in four harbours (Sydney, Hobart, Auckland and Tauranga) to quantify the perceptions of different stakeholder groups towards ecological engineering of artificial structures. This study tested whether respondents with a greater connection, concern for environment, with a higher socio-economic status or who lived in a more modified harbour environment are more likely to be supportive of ecological engineering than other respondents. The study also assessed whether respondents with prior knowledge about the dominant artificial structure in their harbour (seawalls) agreed with the positive effects, disagreed with negative effects, and were more willing to contribute to costs of ecological engineering than those without prior knowledge. Results showed that most people are supportive of ecological engineering (92.55%). However, stakeholders whose work is directly linked to the harbour are more supportive of ecological engineering in Sydney and Auckland, than in Tauranga or Hobart. Environmental concern, education, income and level of harbour modification all have a positive influence on support for ecological engineering. Prior knowledge also influenced willingness to pay for ecological engineering. These results are promising for councils and managers seeking to implement ecological engineering initiatives, and looking to understand stakeholder groups' attitudes and perceptions towards ecological engineering initiatives.

The aim of this work was to describe for the first time the shallow sublittoral sessile benthos on coastal defense structures in Crete (Eastern Mediterranean Sea) in order to identify potential differences in comparison to natural rocky substrates, adopting both a taxonomic and functional (i.e. macroalgal structural complexity) approach. Three shallow (1-3 m) localities were studied in the north coast and three in the south coast of the island (six localities in total). At each locality, two types of hard sub-strate were selected: an artificial coastal defense structure (rip-rap) and the nearest natural rocky substrates. The percent cover of sessile taxa was calculated using random points counts over photoquadrats (20 x 20 cm). The structure of the assemblage differed between artificial and natural habitats. Values of Shannon-Wiener's diversity index and number of taxa were higher in natural substrates. In addition, cover of arborescent macroalgae was lower on artificial substrates. In conclusion, rip-raps do not function as surrogates of natural hard substrates in the study area since their shallow subtidal assemblages differ in terms of community structure, diversity and functionality. The deficient performance of such artificial structures could be attributed to the combined effects of abiotic factors and biotic processes, including substrate nature and roughness as well as differential grazing pressure.",,,,,12th Panhellenic Symposium of Oceanography and Fisheries12th Panhellenic Symposium of Oceanography and Fisheries,"MAY 30-JUN 03, 2018MAY 30-JUN 03, 2018",,"Ionian Univ, Corfu, GREECEIonian Univ, Corfu, GREECE",20,1,0,0,18,0,21,,,1108-393X,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Seville, Dept Zool, Lab Biol Marina, Seville, SpainAristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Biol, Thessaloniki, GreeceHellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Biotechnol & Aquaculture, Anavyssos, Greece",,,,2019-01-01,WOS:000509109900005,,

It may, however, become increasingly important to consider the value of such structures as habitat when decisions are made with respect to the management of artificial structures. This study investigates the role marinas play as habitat for fish by examining the distribution of fish associated with these urban developments and how this distribution relates to the physical characteristics of marinas. Assemblages of fish associated with marinas in waterways around Sydney were sampled in August and December 2002 and May 2003. Counts were done around structures present at marinas, i.e. pontoons and pilings and in the open water immediately adjacent to these structures. Within marinas, spatial patterns were particular to the types of fish examined. Large mobile species, such as Acanthopagrus australis and Girella tricuspidata,. moved between structures and the open water between them. Smaller species, such as Trachinops taeniatus and Microcanthus strigatus, were found only in the immediate vicinity of these structures. At a larger spatial scale, assemblages of fish varied markedly between different marinas. This variability could not, however, be attributed to the depth of water, the age or size of marinas, nor the type of material with which marinas were constructed (i.e. pontoons or jetties).

This has been likened to urbanization as a driver of global biotic homogenization in the marine environment the process by which species invasions and extinctions increase the genetic, taxonomic, or functional similarity of communities at local, regional, and global scales. Ecological engineering research showed that small-scale engineering interventions can have a significant positive effect on the biodiversity associated with artificial structures, promoting more diverse and resilient communities on local scales. This knowledge can be applied to the design of multifunctional structures that provide a range of ecosystem services.

In this study, coastline changes due to such construction were investigated by comparing historical aerial photographs, taking two beaches (Gusan-Wolsong coast and Osan-Yeongsin coast) as examples. In these two beaches, submerged artificial breakwaters and groins were constructed to reduce erosion which had been accelerated since the extension of the existing harbors in the north. These defence measures seemed to work successfully initially, but they soon caused new erosional problems on the neighboring beaches. Historical changes of the two shorelines for the last 30-40 years showed that the standard deviations of beach widths estimated from the sections comprising the entire coastline have been continuously increased since the construction of the artificial structures, with minimal changes of mean beach width or total areas. The beach width of protected areas was largely increased but that of neighboring coast was severely affected.

Around half of the wind farms are located in rural coastal locations. This paper discusses the various environmental, social and political issues associated with coastal wind farm development in Australia by assessing the coastal impact of wind farms and the adequacy of coastal management strategies for dealing with such impacts.

However, obstacles, such as applicability in the field and increasing calculation costs with increasing structural complexity, remain for real-time structure monitoring offshore. Therefore, this study proposes the comparison of cosine similarity with sensor data to overcome such challenges. As the comparison target, this method uses the rate of changes of natural frequencies before and after the occurrence of various damage scenarios, including not only single but multiple damages, which are organized by the experiment technique design. The comparison method alerts to the occurrence of damage using a normalized warning index, which enables workers to manage the risk of damage. By comparison, moreover, the case most similar with the current status is directly figured out without any additional analysis between monitoring and damage identification, which renders the damage identification process simpler. Plus, the averaged rate of errors in detection is suggested to evaluate the damage level more precisely, if needed. Therefore, this method contributes to the application of real-time structural health monitoring for offshore structures by providing an approach to improve the usability of the proposed technique.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,0,19,,,,1424-8220,,,,,,,,,,"Korea Maritime & Ocean Univ, Ocean Sci & Technol Sch, Dept Convergence Study Ocean Sci & Technol, Busan 49112, South KoreaKorea Res Inst Ships & Ocean Engn KRISO, Offshore Ind R&BD Ctr, Geoje 53201, South KoreaKorea Maritime & Ocean Univ, Dept Ocean Engn, Busan 49112, South KoreaKorea Inst Ocean Sci & Technol, Coastal Dev & Ocean Energy Res Ctr, Busan 49111, South Korea",,,,2019-08-26,WOS:000479160300015,31295926,

As a result, an increasing number of structural modifications occur in coastal nursery and spawning habitats of fish. Concomitant to this increase, there have been declines in many coastal fish populations and changes in the composition of fish communities. As requested by Swedish stakeholders, this review aimed to synthesise scientific evidence of the impact on fish recruitment of structural modifications in temperate coastal areas.Methods: We searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature on such impacts in English, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, German, Swedish and Spanish. Searches were performed in bibliographic databases, specialist websites, bibliographies of review articles. We also contacted stakeholder to find relevant literature. Eligible studies included small- and large-scale field studies in marine systems and large lakes (> 10,000 km(2)) in temperate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Included replicated comparisons of fish recruitment between altered and unaltered control areas, comparisons before and after an alteration, or both. Relevant outcomes (response variables) included measures of recruitment defined as abundance of juvenile fish in coastal habitats. All fish species were considered. Articles were screened for eligibility by title, abstract and full text. Eligible studies were critically appraised based on their external and internal validity. From each eligible study of sufficient validity, we extracted information on study design, measured outcomes, exposure, type of comparator, effect modifiers and study findings. Study findings were synthesised narratively.Results: We searched for eligible studies in 15 databases, 24 specialist websites, Google Scholar, and bibliographies of 11 review articles. The review finally included 37 studies that were eligible and of sufficient validity to be considered for final synthesis. Most studies (23 of 37) were from the Northern Hemisphere. Studies varied in design, spatial resolution, target fish species, and type of structural habitat change. This high level of variation did not allow for a quantitative synthesis and prevented us from drawing general conclusions on the impact of structures or structural modifications on fish recruitment. In this review we provide a narrative synthesis of the evidence base and classify eligible studies into six categories (based on type of exposure and comparator). The categories are as follows: the impacts on fish recruitment of: (1) artificial structures in coastal areas, (2) structures designed as fish attractors, (3) large scale urban sprawl, (4) 'novel' habitats, (5) habitat loss, and (6) restoration.Conclusions: This review revealed a very limited evidence base for how structural modifications and marine urban sprawl can affect fish recruitment. Thus, there is a substantial mismatch between stakeholder needs and research evidence. Further, the impact and ecological performance of artificial structures depend both on context and species. Clearly, there is a need for more research on the subject, especially on long-term consequences at larger spatial scales.",,,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,19,0,39,,,,2047-2382,,,,,,,,,,"Stockholm Environm Inst, Mistra Council Evidence Based Environm Management, Linnegatan 87D,Box 24218, S-10451 Stockholm, SwedenUmea Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, SwedenUniv Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Via S Alberto 163, I-48123 Ravenna, ItalyUniv Bologna, Interdept Res Ctr Environm Sci, UO CoNISMa, Via S Alberto 163, I-48123 Ravenna, ItalyUniv Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Marine Ecol, Nijenborgh 7, NL-9747 AG Groningen, NetherlandsCornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Cornell Biol Field Stn, 900 Shackelton Point Rd, Bridgeport, NY 13030 USATech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",,,,2019-03-29,WOS:000461529000001,,

Such structures must be compared with natural reefs in order to assess their performance, but past comparisons typically examined artificial structures that were too small, or were immature, relative to the natural reefs. We compared coral and fish communities on two large (> 400,000 m(3)) and mature (> 25 year) artificial reefs with six natural coral patches. Coral cover was higher on artificial reefs (50%) than in natural habitats (31%), but natural coral patches contained higher species richness (29 vs. 20) and coral diversity (H' = 2.3 vs. 1.8). Multivariate analyses indicated strong differences between coral communities in natural and artificial habitats. Fish communities were sampled seasonally for 1 year. Multivariate fish communities differed significantly among habitat types in the summer and fall, but converged in the winter and spring. Univariate analysis indicated that species richness and abundance were stable throughout the year on natural coral patches but increased significantly in the summer on artificial reefs compared with the winter and spring, explaining the multivariate changes in community structure. The increased summer abundance on artificial reefs was mainly due to adult immigration. Piscivores were much more abundant in the fall than in the winter or spring on artificial reefs, but had low and stable abundance throughout the year in natural habitats. It is likely that the decreased winter and spring abundance of fish on the artificial reefs resulted from both predation and emigration. These results indicate that large artificial reefs can support diverse and abundant coral and fish communities. However, these communities differ structurally and functionally from those in natural habitats, and they should not be considered as replacements for natural coral and fish communities.",,,,,,,,,123,2,0,0,101,1,136,,,0722-4028,1432-0975,,,,,,,,,,"Zayed Univ, Dept Nat Sci & Publ Hlth, Dubai, U Arab EmiratesUniv Windsor, Dept Biol Sci, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, CanadaAmer Univ Sharjah, Dept Biol & Chem, Sharjah, U Arab EmiratesUNU, INWEH, Hamilton, ON L8P 0A1, Canada",UNU,,,2009-09-01,WOS:000268323800012,,

Recent trends in offshore wind have seen the installation of turbines in deeper and more remote waters due to the presence of stronger and more consistent wind resources. This has led to the development of floating foundations for turbine mounting in water depths above 40 m, where conventional bottom-fixed foundations are not considered economically feasible. However, due to its emerging nature, floating wind must attain market maturity to be considered cost competitive. It is a widely accepted belief that market expansion yields technological maturity. Therefore, this paper adopts a systems approach to investigate the viability of floating offshore wind power generation in Scotland and South Africa. It does this through a content analysis of relevant secondary documentation, including policy documents, industry reports, press releases, online publications, and databases to determine the drivers and barriers of floating wind in the case contexts. The key findings are that substantial technical potential is required to attract floating wind investments, political support is necessary in order to scale up, a strong offshore wind supply chain could cushion the high-cost effects of floating wind projects, and more innovative business models such as corporate Power Purchasing Agreements could serve as social drivers for such projects. The main contextual conclusions drawn from this paper are that Scotland's inaugural floating wind projects benefitted from the Scottish government's Renewable Obligation scheme, however its discontinuation threatens the prospects of future projects. Alternatively, South Africa's technical potential, coupled with its government's healthy appetite for renewable energy development, could see the take up of this technology in the near future, with corresponding benefits for more sustainable energy in densely populated areas, compliant with SDG 7.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,0,14,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"De Montfort Univ, Fac Comp Engn & Media, Sch Engn & Sustainable Dev, Gateway House, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England",,,,2020-11-27,WOS:000588943400001,,

As they mature, they adopt the social roles of women and become muxes, a type of third gender favored in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Muxes autenticas (authentic muxes) generally aspire to live as, or to become, women, yet the category of muxe is expansive and can also encompass masculine homosexual men who do not wear female dress (muxe nguiu).As the Mexican photographer Nelson Morales explained to me recently, it was only after moving away from his small town of Union Hidalgo to study in the capital of Oaxaca, and following a stint working on an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, that his strong rejection of his community's social norms began to change. Initially, I did not want to be a traditional muxe, to dress or to look like a woman. I did not want to be their friend, he said. But then, about seven years ago, Morales, who is now thirty-four years old, purchased his first camera, returned home for a visit, and was invited to photograph a muxe beauty pageant. While initially apprehensive, Morales asked the contestants to dress in traditional Tehuana clothes and photographed them in black and white, following the example of Graciela Iturbide's well-known muxe portraiture from the mid-1980s.Saturated in color, Morales's highly stylized, theatrical images feature muxe protagonists who confidently confront the camera. In one, Dorismar wears an orange strapless gown and tilts out of a bright red mototaxi in the countryside, her windswept hair and dress in counterpoint to the white wind turbines in the background. For a portrait of Keara Pamuce Rosoff dressed as a virgin, Morales posed her in front of a dramatic red curtain, holding a rosary and standing next to a toppled statue of the archangel Michael. (Keara Pamuce died in 2016 under uncertain circumstances; many queer men and trans women in Mexico experience profound violence, and have limited access to antiretroviral medication if they are HIV positive.)Some portraits are more intimate, such as Dear Mother, Union Hidalgo, Oaxaca (2016), which shows a beauty queen in a hand-painted, maritime-inspired ball gown, sitting with her grandmother in front of the family altar, styled to emulate Frida Kahlo's painting The Two Fridas (1939). Others are haunting, including the portrait of Thalia, an older muxe ngola or big muxe (big referring to age, not size), who appears reclining in tall grass. For me, this photo is very fuerte-powerful or disturbing-Morales indicates, because not all muxes get to be big. Thalia lives on the edge of town, alone, in a precarious situation. All this muxe wants is for someone to listen to her.Several photographs feature Morales himself. In one, he is coupled with Erika, a muxe sex worker, their bodies entwined in front of a green wall; this image was the result of an assignment for a workshop in Oaxaca with the French photographer Antoine d'Agata. It unleashed something in my creative process, Morales said. I told Erika that we were going to have fun and to do crazy, erotic things, and that she should not feel bad for me, because I am also gay.In Our Piety, Union Hidalgo, Oaxaca (2016), we see Morales in a patch of banana trees in the pose of Jesus in the pieta, held by two seemingly naked muxe beauty queens, Salome and La Paca. The religious allusions and sexual content in certain of his images have made Morales's photographs the object of censorship in Mexico, where some conservative galleries and museums refuse to exhibit his work. But Morales is defiant. I have come to understand that not everybody likes my work. It's something I have to live with.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0003-6420,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,,,2017-12-06,WOS:000415748600016,,

Often the ability to determine changes resulting from significant impacts has been compromised by the lack of pre-deployment data. The Loch Linnhe artificial reef is a 42 000 tonnes reef complex that is proposed for deployment in the period 2001-2004. A series of baseline data sets were generated in the 4 years preceding construction to facilitate multi-parameter post-reef deployment comparisons. Hydrographical data included a detailed assessment of tidal current dynamics over the complete spring-neap tidal cycle. Sedimentological research included broad-scale remote acoustic surveys coupled with sediment granulometric analysis. Seasonal changes in oxygen levels through the sediment column were also determined. The existing biological community at the proposed site was assessed through monthly diver observation and remote sediment grab sampling. These data sets will form the basis of a comprehensive evaluation of reef impacts and performance to be made post-reef construction.(C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Increased intensity and regularity of storms such as Superstorm Sandy heighten the importance of our understanding of sediment transport processes. A weakness of current modeling capabilities is the ability to easily visualize the result in an intuitive manner. Many of the available visualization software packages display only a single variable at once, usually as a two-dimensional, plan-view cross-section. With such limited display capabilities, sophisticated 3D models are undermined in both the interpretation of results and dissemination of information to the public. Here we explore a subset of existing modeling capabilities (specifically, modeling scour around man-made structures) and visualization solutions, examine their shortcomings and present a design for a 4D visualization for sediment transport studies that is based on perceptually-focused data visualization research and recent and ongoing developments in multivariate displays. Vector and scalar fields are co-displayed, yet kept independently identifiable utilizing human perception's separation of color, texture, and motion. Bathymetry, sediment grain-size distribution, and forcing hydrodynamics are a subset of the variables investigated for simultaneous representation. Direct interaction with field data is tested to support rapid validation of sediment transport model results.Our goal is a tight integration of both simulated data and real world observations to support analysis and simulation of the impact of major sediment transport events such as hurricanes. We unite modeled results and field observations within a geodatabase designed as an application schema of the Arc Marine Data Model. Our real-world focus is on the Redbird Artificial Reef Site, roughly 18 nautical miles offshore Delaware Bay, Delaware, where repeated surveys have identified active scour and bedform migration in 27 m water depth amongst the more than 900 deliberately sunken subway cars and vessels. Coincidently collected high-resolution multibeam bathymetry, backscatter, and side-scan sonar data from surface and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems along with complementary sub-bottom, grab sample, bottom imagery, and wave and current (via ADCP) datasets provide the basis for analysis. This site is particularly attractive due to overlap with the Delaware Bay Operational Forecast System (DBOFS), a model that provides historical and forecast oceanographic data that can be tested in hindcast against significant changes observed at the site during Superstorm Sandy and in predicting future changes through small-scale modeling around the individual reef objects.",,,,,MTS/IEEE Oceans ConferenceMTS/IEEE Oceans Conference,"SEP 23-27, 2013SEP 23-27, 2013","IEEE; Marine Technol Soc; IEEE Oceanic Engn Soc; Newfoundland Labrador; Seacon; UC San Diego, Scripps Inst OceanogIEEE; Marine Technol Soc; IEEE Oceanic Engn Soc; Newfoundland Labrador; Seacon; UC San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog","San Diego, CASan Diego, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-0-933957-40-4,,,,,,,,,"Univ New Hampshire, Ctr Coastal & Ocean Mapping, Joint Hydrog Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USAUniv Delaware, Coastal Sediments Hydrodynam & Engn Lab, Newark, DE 19716 USA",,,,2014-05-28,WOS:000334165801083,,

However application to offshore structures is made particularly difficult since their natural frequencies undergo significant alteration over time as a result of various factors such as changes of the deck mass due to the quantity of oil stored. As a consequence, in order to be detected, damage must produce greater variations in the natural frequencies. To overcome this problem the approach of 'novelty detection' is proposed.The article describes this method and its application to a numerical simulation of a steel offshore platform.

To sustain this growth, power sector needs to build additional generation capacity. However, continued dependence on fossil fuels to power the growth of electricity generation capacity, is hardly sustainable. Renewable Energy source forms a miniscule portion (25 GW,similar to 12%) of India's overall power generation today (202 GW). The share of wind energy (17 GW) is 67% of the total renewable energy basket. But the contribution from offshore wind farms is non-existent, as all the wind energy generated in India is only through onshore wind farms. India needs a policy framework to encourage the development of offshore wind farms. Several European countries have effective offshore wind energy policies that have helped them to accelerate the growth of their offshore wind energy sector. This paper does an exhaustive literature survey, to identify 21 building blocks of a successful offshore wind energy policy initiative adopted by select European countries, which have been classified under 5 broad categories-Government support, Fiscal and quota based incentives, Availability of local expertise, Capital for investments and Building an enabling ecosystem, which can be leveraged by India to articulate its own offshore wind energy policy.

A survey of recruitment of juvenile corals to the artificial structures 10 months after the bleaching event showed that 67% of recruits (greater than or equal to0.5 cm diameter) were acroporids and pocilloporids and 33% were from massive families (n = 202) compared to 94% and 6%, respectively, in 1990-1994 (n = 3136), Similar post-bleaching dominance of recruitment by branching corals was seen on nearby natural reef (78% acroporids and pocilloporids; 22% massives), A Linear regression of April mean monthly SST against year was highly significant (p < 0.001) and suggests a rise of 0.16C per decade, If this trend continues, by 2030 mean April SST in the central atolls mill normally exceed the anomaly level at which corals appear there are susceptible to mass bleaching, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Of most uncertainty to these predictions is determining the low frequency viscous damping which dominates the resonant surge and sway motions. In this paper, full-scale motion observations of the Fukushima FORWARD's floating wind substation are used to determine the platforms viscous drag forces.

Storm-driven mixing can be considered as a seasonal disturbance regime to demersal communities, characterized by the recurrence of large changes in bottom water temperatures. Black sea bass are a model ubiquitous demersal species in the Middle Atlantic Bight, as their predominantly sedentary behavior makes them ideal for tagging studies while also regularly exposing them to summer storm disturbances and the physiological stresses associated with thermal destratification. To better understand the responsiveness of black sea bass to storm impacts, we coupled biotelemetry with a high-resolution Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). During the summers of 2016-2018, 8-15 black sea bass were released each year with acoustic transponders at three reef sites, which were surrounded by data-logging receivers. Data were analyzed for activity levels and reef departures of black sea bass, and fluctuations in temperature, current velocity, and turbulent kinetic energy. Movement rates were depressed with each consecutive passing storm, and late-season storms were associated with permanent evacuations by a subset of tagged fish. Serial increases in bottom temperature associated with repeated storm events were identified as the primary depressor of local movement. Storm-driven increases in turbulent kinetic energy and current velocity had comparatively smaller, albeit significant, effects. Black sea bass represents both an important fishery resource and an indicator species for the impact of offshore wind development in the United States. Their availability to fisheries surveys and sensitivity to wind turbine impacts will be biased during periods of high storm activity, which is likely to increase with regional climate change.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,4,0,6,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USAUniv Maryland, Horn Point Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Cambridge, MD USASouthern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China",,,,2020-12-22,WOS:000596569200082,33264326,

Urban foreshore developments, i.e. those built on the interface of intertidal and/or subtidal zones, have the potential to incorporate clear multifunctional outcomes, by supporting novel ecosystems. We present a step-by-step eco-engineering framework for 'building blue' that will allow coastal managers to facilitate planning and construction of sustainable foreshore developments.

To examine how wave power devices may be colonized by epifaunal organisms, 21 concrete foundations used for anchoring wave power generators were studied during two years, 2007 and 2008. The foundations were placed in two different clusters, located north and south within the Lysekil test site at the Swedish west coast. The degree to which early recruits covered the foundations and the succession of epibenthic communities were documented during two years. A succession in colonization over time was observed, with a higher degree of cover in the northern location. Furthermore, the northern location showed an increase in number of individuals, number of species and in Shannon-Wiener diversity in 2008. Dominant organisms on the foundations were the serpulid tubeworms (Pomatoceros triqueter) and barnacles (Balanus sp.). This comprehensive large-scale study about succession and colonization patterns on wave power foundations suggests that the location of wave energy devices affects colonization patterns. This gives indications on settlement patterns on already operating and planned offshore wave power parks further off the coasts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Structural integrity control becomes highly sensitive to interventions under a potential loss of structural integrity when it comes to offshore oil and gas production and process facilities. This is mainly due to the inherent constraints present in carrying out engineering work in the offshore atmosphere. It has been further exacerbated by the ageing offshore structures and the necessity of carrying out life extension toward the end of their design service lives. Local and international regulations demand the implementation of appropriate strengthening, modification and repair plans when significant changes in the structural integrity are revealed. In this context, strengthening, modification and repair techniques such as welding, member removal/reduction of loading, mechanical clamping and grouted repairs play a vital role. This manuscript presents an approach for prioritizing the strengthening, modification and repair techniques using a multi-criteria analysis approach.

An important but overlooked factor controlling restoration operations is overgrazing by herbivores. The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of different potential feeders on Cystoseira amentacea, a native canopy-forming alga of the Mediterranean infralittoral fringe, and test whether manipulation of grazing pressure can facilitate the human-guided installation of this focal species on coastal structures. Results of laboratory tests and field experiments revealed that Sarpa salpa, the only strictly native herbivorous fish in the Western Mediterranean Sea, can be a very effective grazer of C. amentacea in artificial habitats, up to as far as the infralittoral fringe, which is generally considered less accessible to fishes. S. salpa can limit the success of forestation operations in artificial novel habitats, causing up to 90% of Cystoseira loss after a few days. Other grazers, such as limpets and crabs, had only a moderate impact.

Multi-seasonal sampling was conducted at one of the oil platforms located in the central North Sea between September 2010 and January 2014 to characterise temporal variation in the stomach contents of different fish species. A total of 6 fish species were recorded, including commercially important gadoids such as saithe Pollachius virens, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus and cod Gadus morhua. Saithe fed predominantly on euphausiids and haddock consumed a large proportion of ophiuroids, whereas cod were mainly piscivorous. The prey compositions were significantly different between species, indicating the presence of interspecific prey resource partitioning among those species. To further investigate possible links between the feeding habits of the most dominant fish species, saithe, and the physical presence of offshore platforms across the North Sea, a separate set of stomach data was collected during the 2012 Quarter 3 International Bottom Trawl Survey aboard the FRV `Scotia'. The multivariate analysis of both data sets showed that the observed spatio-temporal variability in the saithe diet was significantly explained by proximity to the nearest offshore platforms and changes in water temperatures, which appear to reflect patterns of euphausiid availability over space and time. The physical presence of the offshore structures may potentially affect the distribution/availability of zooplankton (i.e. euphausiids) and thereby influence the feeding behaviour of saithe and any other marine populations that are interconnected to the dynamics of such trophic interactions.",,,,,,,,,11,0,1,0,7,0,13,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Oceanlab, Main St, Newburgh AB41 6AA, Aberdeen, Scotland",,,,2016-01-19,WOS:000368922900013,,

Compressive strength, elastic modulus, permeability (water permeability coefficient), expansion behavior and SEM images were tested and analyzed. The results showed that the behavior of mortar evolved in two stages, initial improvement followed by later degradation, determined by two competitive effects under each condition. Different deterioration mechanisms worked in the different exposure conditions. We proposed binomial formulas to describe the evolutions of the compressive strength and water permeability, and we further applied them in other researches well. Meanwhile, there was a linear relationship between elastic modulus and square root of compressive strength. Furthermore, the relation between water permeability and compressive strength was highly dependent on exposure types and time.

Here we evaluated how artificial structures, an integral part of urbanisation in the marine environment, affects key functional properties of the habitat-forming kelp Ecklonia radiata. Given that stressors rarely occur in isolation, we assessed the effects of infrastructure across an urbanised estuary. Estuaries are ideal for studying how multiple anthropogenic and natural stressors influence potential impacts of infrastructure on habitat-forming species because these habitats usually face a wide range and levels of stressors. Here, we compared the abundance of habitat-forming macro-algae as well as the growth, erosion and photosynthetic activity of kelp in artificial and natural habitats across one of the largest urbanised estuaries in the word - Sydney Harbour. We predicted that effects of artificial structures on functional attributes of kelps would be stronger in the inner area of the Harbour, characterised by higher levels of human impacts and low flushing. Contrary to our predictions, we found that effects of infrastructure were consistent across the estuary, regardless of the ecological footprint caused by human activities or natural environmental gradients. When differences were observed between areas of the estuary, they mostly occurred independently of impacts of substrate type. Importantly, we found lower erosion rates of kelp on pilings than on reefs, likely resulting in lower production of detritus in estuaries where natural reefs are degraded or lost and pilings added. Such impacts have important implications for the connectivity among coastal habitats and secondary productivity in adjacent and remote habitats, which are highly dependent on the exportation of kelp detritus.

The present study develops a mathematical formulation for the aerodynamic analysis of offshore triceratops and examines its response under regular waves in the presence of wind. Based on the numerical studies conducted here, it is observed that triceratops shows significant reduction in deck response, with no transfer of rotation from the BLS; the deck remains horizontal under the encountered wave loads. Lateral displacement of the deck is restrained due to the compliancy offered by the ball joints. The heave response is less in comparison with the surge response; this implies that the platform is stiff in heave degree-of-freedom, which is required for deep-water compliant platforms. A lesser response in the deck confirms that the deck remains horizontal even when the pitch response is significant in the BLS units.

Hydroacoustics were used to determine the spatial distribution, both in distance and depth, of relative fish biomass, or mean volume backscatter, within 500 m of the center of each site. Mean volume backscatter (MVBS, S-v) was highest near the structure, then declined rapidly with distance. We estimated that background-noise level was obtained at similar to 100 m from the structures.

Thirty-nine day roosts and 14 night roosts of, in total, five species were found in man-made structures. Many structures provided day and night roosts for different bat species. Although forest and water bodies are limited, and intensive grazing has created several open areas on the island, a remarkably high bat diversity developed, making Asinara an important offshore retreat area for bats in Italy.

These offshore wind farms will be integrated into an ecosystem already facing multiple anthropogenic disturbances such as maritime transport, fisheries, oyster and mussel farming, and sediment dredging. Currently no integrated, ecosystem-based study on the effects of the construction and exploitation of offshore wind farms exists, where biological approaches generally focused on the conservation of some valuable species or groups of species. Complementary trophic web modelling tools were applied to the Bay of Seine ecosystem (to the 50 km(2) area covered by the wind farm) to analyse the potential impacts of benthos and fish aggregation caused by the introduction of additional hard substrates from the piles and the turbine scour protections. An Ecopath ecosystem model composed of 37 compartments, from phytoplankton to seabirds, was built to describe the situation before the construction of the wind farm. Then, an Ecosim projection over 30 years was performed after increasing the biomass of targeted benthic and fish compartments. Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) indices were calculated for the two periods, before and after, to compare network functioning and the overall structural properties of the food web. Our main results showed (1) that the total ecosystem activity, the overall system omnivory (proportion of generalist feeders), and the recycling increased after the construction of the wind farm; (2) that higher trophic levels such as piscivorous fish species, marine mammals, and seabirds responded positively to the aggregation of biomass on piles and turbine scour protections; and (3) a change in keystone groups after the construction towards more structuring and dominant compartments. Nonetheless, these changes could be considered as limited impacts of the wind farm installation on this coastal trophic web structure and functioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Finally, we assessed the relative abundance of juvenile lobsters in each habitat by deploying artificial structures in seagrass sites and compared these data with data from similar deployments of artificial structures in hard-bottom habitat in other years. More early benthic juvenile lobsters were recovered from cages placed in hard-bottom than in seagrass, but mortality of the early benthic life stage was high in both habitats. In regional surveys, the mean number of lobsters recovered from artificial shelters deployed within seagrass was lower than in any year that we sampled hard-bottom, indicating that fewer lobsters reside naturally in seagrass, particularly large juveniles >40 mm carapace length. The greater abundance (and likely survival) of juvenile P argus that we observed in hard-bottom habitat as opposed to seagrass, combined with previous studies demonstrating that postlarval P. argus are attracted to, settle in, and metamorphose more quickly in red macroalgae, confirm that macroalgae-dominated hard-bottom habitat appears to be the preferred and more optimal nursery for Caribbean spiny lobster.",,,,,8th International Conference and Workshop on Lobster Biology and Management8th International Conference and Workshop on Lobster Biology and Management,"SEP, 2007SEP, 2007",,"Charlottetown, CANADACharlottetown, CANADA",17,0,0,0,16,0,18,,,0028-8330,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Program Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USAOld Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USAFlorida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USAFish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Marathon, FL USANo Kentucky Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Highland Hts, KY 41076 USA",,,,2009-02-01,WOS:000265720000029,,

They are nocturnally active and shelter during the day presumably as an anti-predatory adaptation. Recognizing that the need for shelter is paramount, current studies are aimed at development of artificial reefs (ARs) that imitate the natural shelters of lobsters, particularly those inhabiting hard substrates, and provide appropriate sheltering needs for relevant benthic ontogenetic stages. A review of the literature from the past 5 decades suggests that interest in developing ARs for lobsters has increased. Much of this increase in research efforts stems, on one hand, from a better understanding of the recruitment processes of several important commercial lobster species and, on the other hand, from the decline of many commercial lobster populations due to overfishing, diseases, man-made destruction of environment, and other natural phenomena. Most AR studies on lobsters are limited to a small number of species, confined locally, and are conducted only in the short term. Thus there is presently insufficient evidence to argue that these ARs are effective at increasing survival of lobsters at the population level and do little more than aggregate individuals on the reef. Long-term, large-scale, quantitative field studies of ARs of the commercially/ecologically most important lobster species are needed. Such studies will enable understanding of the actual role of these man-made structures in fisheries management and conservation of lobsters.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,,,0025-3146,,,,,,,,,,,"The Leon Recanati Institute for Maritime Studies & Department of Maritime Civilizations The Leon H.

Where invaders are able to disperse from artificial habitats, their impact may spread to surrounding natural communities and therefore it is important to investigate potential factors that reduce or enhance invasibility. We surveyed the distribution of non-indigenous and native invertebrates and algae between artificial habitats and natural reefs in a marine subtidal system. We also deployed sandstone plates as experimental 'reefs' and manipulated the orientation, starting assemblage and degree of shading. Invertebrates (non-indigenous and native) appeared to be responding to similar environmental factors (e. g. orientation) and occupied most space on artificial structures and to a lesser extent reef walls. Non-indigenous invertebrates are less successful than native invertebrates on horizontal reefs despite functional similarities. Manipulative experiments revealed that even when non-indigenous invertebrates invade vertical reefs, they are unlikely to gain a foothold and never exceed covers of native invertebrates (regardless of space availability). Community ecology suggests that invertebrates will dominate reef walls and algae horizontal reefs due to functional differences, however our surveys revealed that native algae dominate both vertical and horizontal reefs in shallow estuarine systems. Few non-indigenous algae were sampled in the study, however where invasive algal species are present in a system, they may present a threat to reef communities. Our findings suggest that non-indigenous species are less successful at occupying space on reef compared to artificial structures, and manipulations of biotic and abiotic conditions (primarily orientation and to a lesser extent biotic resistance) on experimental reefs explained a large portion of this variation, however they could not fully explain the magnitude of differences.",,,,,,,,,94,0,0,0,82,1,98,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New S Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaPort Stephens Fisheries Inst, New S Wales Dept Primary Ind, Nelson Bay, NSW, Australia",,,,2012-05-30,WOS:000305353400084,22666459,

It has been argued that this effect should be considered during decisions over their removal during decommissioning. In the North Sea, leaving such structures in place is prohibited but derogations are allowed for large concrete installations. To assess removal options for one such installation, the Halfweg GBS (gravity-based structure) a concrete platform foundation off the Dutch coast, we studied the resident fouling macrofauna community. The faunal structure, biomass and trophic composition of the Halfweg was then compared with those from the surrounding seabed sediments, other local artificial structures and a natural rocky reef. In total, 65 macrofaunal species were observed on the concrete (52 species), steel legs (32) and surrounding rock dump (44) of Halfweg. Mean Simpson diversity per sample was highest on the rock dump (0.71) but concrete (0.54) and steel (0.60) of the GBS were lower than seabed (0.69). Ten of the species observed on the concrete were not reported on other substrates while 10 of the species were also observed in the surrounding seabed. The GBS structure was numerically dominated by Arthropoda which comprised 98% of the total abundance. Mean ash free dry weight (AFDW) was significantly higher (p<0.001) on the Halfweg substrates (204 g AFDW per m2) than in the surrounding seabed (65 g AFDW per m2). Over 94% of the biomass on Halfweg consisted of the plumose anemone Metridium senile. While common on other reefs, this species was absent from the surrounding seabed. Macrofaunal feeding mechanisms of the concrete and rock dump communities on the GBS were similar to those of nearby sediments, although these differed from those on the Halfweg steel legs. Therefore, the presence of Halfweg alters the local community feeding modes. Multivariate analysis revealed that taxonomic structure of the GBS and other artificial structures significantly differed from that of the sedimentary habitats. Low numbers of non-indigenous species on Halfweg indicated that the structure does not act as a stepping stone for species invasions. Our data show that the Halfweg structures significantly increase local biodiversity and biomass. Removal of the concrete and steel legs of the GBS (leaving the rock dump) will significantly reduce local macrofauna biodiversity. The long-term impact on macrofaunal biomass is low. Leaving the complete Halfweg structure in place will result in an enriched local macrofaunal biodiversity and feeding mode diversity.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wageningen Marine Research,,,,2023-04-06,PPRN:10678487,,

As coastal landscapes are transformed, recognizing the impact that urban structures, such as marinas, seawalls and wharfs, have on local fish populations is becoming increasingly important. The extent to which fish are able to maintain natural ecological assemblages can be measured, to a certain extent, by how closely they mimic natural habitats. In Sydney Harbour, assemblages of fish associated with artificial structures were compared with those associated with natural rocky reefs. Sampling was carried out in five locations, each with a marina, swimming enclosure and natural reef. In each location, different habitats supported different assemblages, but differences between habitats were not consistent among locations. Subsequent sampling compared artificial and natural sites in three different areas in each of three different estuaries. Results indicated that differences in fish assemblages between artificial and natural sites were greater than differences between sites within each habitat, but there were no patterns among different positions in an estuary or from estuary to estuary. This study provides initial evidence that, although artificial habitats generally support the same species as found on natural reefs, assemblages usually differed between natural and artificial habitats.

These results indicate that there is merit to using this approach to make net pen fish farming more environmentally sustainable.",,,,,8th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Artificial Habitats8th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Artificial Habitats,20052005,,"Biloxi, MSBiloxi, MS",5,0,0,0,5,0,6,,,0007-4977,1553-6955,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Haifa, Leon Recanati Inst Maritime Studies, IL-31905 Haifa, IsraelUniv Haifa, Dept Maritime Civilizat, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000235074300010,,

Impulsive change in shoreline and submergence of low lying areas due to sea level rise are the solemn issues that need to be addressed. Indian coastline of about 7516 km is under threat due to global warming and related human interventions. Remote sensing data products provide synoptic and repetitive view of the earth in various spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolutions. Hence, it can be used in monitoring coastal areas on a temporal scale. Critical Erosion hotspots have to be given proper protection measures to avoid further damages. Satellite images serve in delineating shoreline and extracting the hotspots to plan the mitigation works. Coastal inundation maps can be created using remote sensing and geospatial technologies by assuming different sea level rises. Those maps can serve as a base for planning management activities. Soft computing techniques like Fuzzy Logic, Artificial Neural Network, Genetic Algorithm and Support Vector Machine are upcoming soft computing algorithms that find its application in classification, regression, pattern recognition, etc., across multi-disciplinary sciences. They can be used in classifying remote sensing images which in turn can be used for studying the coastal vulnerability. The present paper reviews the works carried out for coastal study using conventional remote sensing techniques and the pertinency of soft computing techniques for the same.

To mitigate the consequential loss of biodiversity, novel approaches such as ecological engineering have been adopted to enhance the biodiversity on these artificial structures. However, the majority of research to date has focused on physical modifications of intertidal seawalls, and such habitat enhancement efforts are labour-and cost-intensive. We examined the feasibility of transplanting nursery-reared scleractinian corals on subtidal seawalls in Singapore with the help of volunteers. Fragments of six hard coral species (Pocillopora damicornis, Hydnophora rigida, Merulina ampliata, Podabacia crustacea, Echinopora lamellosa, Platygyra sinensis) were tested. Fragments of all species fared well in the nurseries with a mean survival rate of 98.5% and 1.1 to 4-fold increase in live tissue area. Six months after transplantation to a seawall, only 50% of P. damicornis transplants survived, while those of M. ampliata decreased in size. Transplants of the other four species exhibited sustained growth and high survival rates (>90%), suggesting that they were more suitable than the former two species as candidates for transplantation onto subtidal seawalls. Scleractinian cover at the transplant site increased from 3% to 20% and generic richness increased from two to eight. The estimated project costs were almost US$ 23,000 if only researchers were involved in the effort, but the inclusion of volunteers in fieldwork and data analyses could help to bring the expenditure down by up to 23%. The study demonstrated the feasibility of transplanting corals onto subtidal seawalls to mitigate the impacts of coastal development, and highlighted its potential for application on other artificial structures. The findings also show that synergy between the community and scientists helps to reduce overall costs and is beneficial for biodiversity enhancement initiatives. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study focuses on six commercially important flatfish species in the North Sea: common sole (Solea solea), European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), brill (Scophtalmus rhombus), European flounder (Platichthys flesus), and common dab (Limanda limanda). We used a particle-tracking model (LARvAE&Co) coupled to a 3D hydrodynamic model to assess the effects of spatial overlap of OWFs with the species' spawning grounds on the larval fluxes to known nursery grounds. An important overlap between planned areas of OWFs and flatfish spawning grounds was detected, with a resulting proportion of settlers originating from those areas varying from 2% to 16%.

Hatching and fledging success due to the structure did not show a significant difference, but there was a difference in breeding success. The main causes of breeding failure were the weather and predation. The most unsuccessful nests were identified in natural structures, because these structures are easier than artificial structures to access. In addition, many people use artificial structures near nests, making it difficult for natural enemies to gain access to the nests. The birds breeding at the PVC pipes mainly experienced failures in nesting due to the weather. PVC pipes were originally used in embankments and building walls, where there are installed drainage applications such as retaining walls. The nest was washed away in the rainy season.

To improve power production capacity, power output quality, and cost effectiveness, comprehensive marine energy utilization has become an inevitable trend in marine energy development. Based on a semi-submersible wind-tidal combined power generation device, a three-dimensional frequency domain potential flow theory is used to study the hydrodynamic performance of such a device. For this study, the RAOs and hydrodynamic coefficients of the floating carrier platform to the regular wave were obtained. The influence of the tidal turbine on the platform in terms of frequency domain was considered as added mass and damping. The direct load of the tidal turbine was obtained by CFX. FORTRAN software was used for the second development of adaptive query workload aware software, which can include the external force. The motion response of the platform to the irregular wave and the tension of the mooring line were calculated under the limiting condition (one mooring line breakage). The results showed that the motion response of the carrier to the surge and sway direction is more intense, but the swing amplitude is within the acceptable range. Even in the worst case scenario, the balance position of the platform was still in the positioning range, which met the requirements of the working sea area. The safety factor of the mooring line tension also complied with the requirements of the design specification. Therefore, it was found that the hydrodynamic performance and motion responses of a semi-submersible wind-tidal combined power generation device can meet the power generation requirements under all design conditions, and the device presents a reliable power generation system.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1671-9433,1993-5048,,,,,,,,,,"Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Shipbldg Engn, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R ChinaSun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Marine Engn & Technol, Guangzhou 518000, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaCHEC Dredging Co Ltd, Shanghai 200136, Peoples R ChinaUniv Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn, Glasgow, Lanark, ScotlandCIMC Offshore Ltd, Natl Engn Lab, Shenzhen 518000, Peoples R China",CHEC Dredging Co LtdCIMC Offshore Ltd,,,2019-05-17,WOS:000466720400008,,

Eco-engineering experiments are typically trialed to succeed; but arguably as much is learnt from failure than from success. Our goal was to trial a generic, cost effective, eco-engineering technique that could be incorporated into rock armouring anywhere in the world. Artificial rock pools were created from manipulated concrete between boulders on the exposed and sheltered sides of a causeway. Experimental treatments were installed in locations where they were expected to fail and compared to controls installed in locations in which they were expected to succeed. Control pools were created lower on the structure where they were immersed on every tidal cycle; experimental pools were created above mean high water spring tide which were only immersed on spring tides. We hypothesised that lower and exposed pools would support significantly higher taxon and functional diversity than upper and sheltered pools. The concrete pools survived the severe winter storms of 2013/14. After 12 months, non-destructive sampling revealed significantly higher mean taxon and functional richness in lower pools than upper pools on the exposed side only. After 24 months the sheltered pools had become inundated with sediments, thus failing to function as rock pools as intended. Destructive sampling on the exposed side revealed significantly higher mean functional richness in lower than upper pools. However, a surprisingly high number of taxa colonised the upper pools leading to no significant difference in mean taxon richness among shore heights. A high number of rare taxa in the lower pools led to total taxon richness being almost twice that of upper pools. These findings highlight that even when expected to fail concrete pools supported diverse assemblages, thus representing an affordable, replicable means of enhancing biodiversity on a variety of artificial structures.",,,,,,,,,75,0,0,0,57,0,78,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth, Devon, EnglandNatl Univ Ireland Galway, Ryan Inst, Galway, IrelandUniv Plymouth, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth, Devon, EnglandMarine Biol Assoc UK, Citadel Hill, Plymouth, Devon, EnglandUniv Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Southampton, Hants, EnglandGalway Mayo Inst Technol, Marine & Freshwater Res Ctr, Galway, Ireland",,,,2016-09-01,WOS:000385393100003,,

As a result, the initial dissipative profile was transformed into a fully reflective one. A beach monitoring program was carried out to record morphological evolution after the nourishment works. Several field assessments of disturbance depth were also made to characterize beach morphodynamics of a nourished beach (Rota) and a natural dissipative one (Tres Piedras), whose slope was similar to the pre-nourishment gradient of Rota beach. Natural dissipative beaches were characterized by spilling breakers that did not significantly affect bottom sand. The severe erosion recorded in the nourished zones was related to the new morphodynamic regime acting on these beaches, which was controlled by high erosive plunging breakers associated with high foreshore slopes.

Artisanal fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea are following this trend, which is intensified by the high price increase of oil. In this context, some management strategies need to be proposed to maintain both natural stocks and human activities.Complementary to the quotas and marine protected areas, the artificial reefs may be one part of the solution. Concerning the fisheries context, artificial reefs (AR) can induce new habitats, more or less complex, to allow the development of rocky fish (adult and/or juvenile). Species from sandy bottoms also profit from these artificial structures because they provide protection of adjacent zones from illegal trawling. We study some artificial reefs in the south of Lion's Gulf (near Le Barcares/Leucate, Mediterranean Sea) constituted by six villages of 12 ha (300 x 400 m). Each zone contains 28 modules of three types: pipes, cubes, and construction debris.We use different methods to evaluate the effectiveness of artificial reefs:Visual count by diving Observation of commercial landing in each harborExternal tagging of fishVisual census showed a significantly higher species richness and density on ARs than on the control site. Abundance, biomass, and LPUE data (Landings Per Unit of Effort) issued from artisanal fisheries landing surveys were not significantly different around the AR system from other fishing grounds of the French Catalan coast. The tagging experiments on Diplodus sargus suggested that the connectivity of demersal fish populations must be taken into account to evaluate the influence area of ARs and thus their indirect impacts on artisanal fisheries. This study highlights the potential of combining methods covering different spatial scales to evaluate direct and indirect impacts of ARs on artisanal fisheries.

The results reveal that the majority of the available SPM could not accumulate on the marshland due to adjacent coastal protection measures. This reduction in SPM affects especially grain sizes within the very fine to fine sand range between 63 and 200 mu m that can account for up to 70% of the sampled SPM during an inundation. Furthermore, we have determined a tidal average SPM concentration threshold of 0.15 g/l should be available on the tidal flat in order to allow sufficient vertical marshland accretion. Although this threshold is exceeded by the determined SPM on the tidal flats around Langeness, the available SPM on the marshland after passing the coastal protection measures is at most 20%.

In this paper, three different versions of a more efficient time simulation technique (ETS) are compared by exposing a test structure to sea states of different intensity. The three different versions of the ETS technique take advantage of the good correlation between extreme responses and their corresponding surface elevation extreme values, or quasi-static and dynamic linear extreme responses.

Calculated fatigue lives based on the S-N approach are sensitive to input parameters. Fracture mechanics analysis is required for prediction of crack sizes during service life in order to account for probability of detection after an inspection event. Analysis based on fracture mechanics needs to be calibrated to that of fatigue test data or S-N data. Calculated probabilities of fatigue failure using probabilistic methods are even more sensitive to the analysis methodology and to input parameters used in the analyses. Thus, use of these methods for planning inspection requires considerable knowledge and engineering skill. Therefore the industry has asked for guidelines that can be used to establish reliable inspection results using these methods. During the last years DNV GL has performed a joint industry project on establishing probabilistic methods for planning in-service inspection for fatigue cracks in offshore structures. The recommendations from this project are now included in a Recommended Practice. The essential features of the probabilistic methods developed for this kind of inspection planning are described in this paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Such a sudden punch-through failure would seriously threaten safety of the offshore structures, even causing casualties. This paper reports results from numerical modeling of spudcan penetration in sediments with interbedded medium-loose sand overlying a clay layer. Three typical stratifications commonly encountered in the field are considered: (1) sand-uniform clay, (2) sand-nonuniform clay and (3) uniform soft clay-sand-uniform soft clay-uniform stiff clay. Further, a field case encountered in the South China Sea was provided and analyzed. The analyses are carried out using a large deformation finite-element (LDFE) approach of the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) in ABAQUS/Explicit. An extended Tresca model with incorporation of strain softening through two additional parameters of Srem and 495 following Einav and Randolph [1] is used for the clay, whereas the Mohr-Coulomb model is adopted for the sand. In particular, a simplified method, in which no additional parameters are required as input data, is presented to predict the punch-through resistance profile of a spudcan foundation on sediments with interbedded medium-loose sand layer. By comparison with the previously published LDFE results, recent centrifuge tests data as well as measures from one field case in the South China Sea, the numerical analyses conducted in this study are verified and discussed, and better performance of the simplified method is shown for prediction of the penetration resistance profile of a spudcan foundation on sediments with interbedded medium-loose sand layer.

It is therefore argued that damage tolerance or robustness is a desirable feature of structures to complement other safety measures to achieve an acceptable risk level. Robustness may be achieved by specific Accidental Collapse Limit State (ALS) criteria. A quantitative, semi-probabilistic ALS procedure has been introduced for offshore structures in Norway in terms of a survival check of damaged structural systems. The initial damage is considered to be due to accidental actions corresponding to an annual exceedance probability of 10(-4) or abnormal resistance. e.g. due to fabrication defects. Survival of the damaged structure under relevant actions with environmental actions at an annual exceedance probability of 10(-2) should be demonstrated. The basis for an implementation of this approach is outlined, with a focus on risk acceptance criteria. The risk analysis methodology on which this procedure rests, is described with an emphasis on determining the characteristic accidental actions with due account of possible risk reduction actions. Since the ALS procedure is based on an alternate path approach, methods for predicting the initial accidental damage and the survival of the damaged structure need to account for nonlinear structural behaviour. It is described how the recent development of computational tools facilitates a realistic ALS approach for steel structures. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

First, a network-based model of the offshore structure subject to external wave force and actuator faults is presented. Second, an event triggering mechanism is proposed such that during the control implementation, only requisite sampled-data is transmitted over networks. Third, an event-triggered H-infinity reliable control problem for the offshore structure is solved by employing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, and the desired controller can be derived. It is shown through simulation results that for possible actuator failures, the networked controller is capable of guaranteeing the stability of the offshore structure. In addition, compared with the H-infinity control scheme without network settings, the proposed controller can suppress the vibration of the offshore structure to almost the same level as the H-infinity controller, while the former requires less control cost. Furthermore, under the network-based controller, the communication resources can be saved significantly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Engineering solutions (e.g. seawalls and breakwaters) in response to protecting coastal communities and associated infrastructure are increasingly becoming economically and ecologically unsustainable. This has led to recommendations to create or restore natural habitats, such as sand dunes, saltmarsh, mangroves, seagrass and kelp beds, and coral and shellfish reefs, to provide coastal protection in place of (or to complement) artificial structures. Coastal managers are frequently faced with the problem of an eroding coastline, which requires a decision on what mitigation options are most appropriate to implement. A barrier to uptake of nature-based coastal defence is stringent evaluation of the effectiveness in comparison to artificial protection structures. Here, we assess the current evidence for the efficacy of nature-based vs. artificial coastal protection and discuss future research needs. Future projects should evaluate habitats created or restored for coastal defence for cost-effectiveness in comparison to an artificial structure under the same environmental conditions. Cost-benefit analyses should take into consideration all ecosystem services provided by nature-based or artificial structures in addition to coastal protection. Interdisciplinary research among scientists, coastal managers and engineers is required to facilitate the experimental trials needed to test the value of these shoreline protection schemes, in order to support their use as alternatives to artificial structures.

Although significant effort has been devoted to the development of predictive equations for wave loads on vertical structures such as piles and seawalls, predictive equations for horizontal superstructures have been limited to offshore platforms in ocean wave conditions. Wave conditions in coastal waters can vary significantly from those in the ocean. Wave periods, and therefore wave lengths, in coastal waters are much shorter. Correspondingly, the ratio of the width of coastal superstructures to the wave length is much greater than those ratios encountered in the offshore environment. Thus, wave-induced water particle velocities and accelerations vary significantly over the width of the structure as compared with offshore structures. This results in corresponding variations in wave forces on the structure. Sheppard and Marin (2009) presented a mathematical model applicable to structures in coastal environments.

Localised corrosion studies of the anodic and cathodic regions of S355 steel surfaces undergoing salt drop corrosion are characterised.

Therefore, microscopic corrosion products will form on newly exposed substrates in marine environments, even before the protective paint is applied.

With these tests, the effectiveness of using artificial reefs to avoid or lessen the effects of breaking wave activity is examined. Four different types of artificial reefs are tested and their effects are compared to a reference test with no artificial reef. The comparison is based on the changes of the size and location of the maximum wave amplitude, the maximum displacement of a scaled platform and the artificial reef's ability to dissipate wave energy.Overall, the results show that placing the rectangular reef in the tank produces the most promising results. However, it is also shown that placing any one of the artificial reefs in the tank will affect a change in the wave motion. Thus, this investigation shows that the use of an artificial reef could be a step in securing a higher level of protection for personnel and operations.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5763-2,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aarhus, Dept Engn, Inge Lehmanns Gade 10, DK-8000 Aarhus C, DenmarkNewcastle Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",,,,2017-12-27,WOS:000417224400054,,

SRA. has proven useful in life extension exercises and inspection planning of existing offshore structures. It is also a useful tool in code development, where the reliability level provided by the code is calibrated to a target failure probability obtained by SRA. This applies both to extreme load situations and also to a structural system under the influence of a time dependent degradation process such as fatigue.The current analysis methods suggested for service life estimation of subsea wells are deterministic, and these analyses are associated with high sensitivity to variations in input parameters. Thus sensitivity screening is often recommended for certain input parameters, and the worst case is then typically used as a basis for the analysis. The associated level of conservatism embedded in results from a deterministic analysis is not quantified, and it is therefore difficult to know and to justify if unnecessary conservatism can be removed from the calculations.By applying SRA to a wellhead fatigue analysis, the input parameters are accounted for with their associated uncertainty given by probability distributions. Analysis results can be generated by use of Monte-Carlo simulations or FORM/SORM (first/second order reliability methods), accounting for the full scatter of system relations and input variations. The level of conservatism can then be quantified and evaluated versus an acceptable probability of failure.This article presents results from a SRA of a fictitious but still realistic well model, including the main assumptions that were made, and discusses how SRA can be applied to a wellhead fatigue analysis. Global load analyses and local stress calculations were carried out prior to the SRA, and a response surface technique was used to interpolate on these results. This analysis has been limited to two hotspots located in each of the two main load bearing members of the wellhead system.The SRA provides a probability of failure estimate that may be used to give better decision support in the event of life extension of existing subsea wells. In addition, a relative uncertainty ranking of input variables provides insight into the problem and knowledge about where risk reducing efforts should be made to reduce the uncertainty.It should be noted that most attention has been given to the method development, and that more comprehensive analysis work and assessment of specific input is needed in a real case.",,,,,"31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUL 01-06, 2012JUL 01-06, 2012","Petrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivPetrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,978-0-7918-4488-5,,,,,,,,,"Norske Veritas AS, Oslo, Norway",,,,2013-11-05,WOS:000324565000012,,

In the first case study, a drilling rig was defouled in-water prior to departure from New Zealand to Australia. Risk mitigation measures were successful in reducing biosecurity risks to the recipient region, but they resulted in the unintentional introduction of the non-indigenous brown mussel (Perna perna) to New Zealand when the rig was defouled in-water by divers.

Degradation of the reef flats by human activities may seriously impair these functions and lead to erosion and inundation. In the Maldives, large areas of reef flats have been degraded by mining of coral for the construction industry. This study was set up to investigate the feasibility of using artificial reef structures to promote rehabilitation of a severely degraded reef flat. Three hundred and sixty tons of concrete reef structures have been deployed over a 4-ha experimental site on a 1-2 m deep reef flat in the Maldives which was mined for coral 20 years ago and still has less than 2.5% live coral cover. Colonization of four sets of three, approximately 50 m(2), artificial reef structures of varying topographic complexity and stabilizing effect, and one set of three replicate 50 m(2) mined control areas has been monitored. All structures were rapidly colonized by fish. Mined 50 m(2) control areas contained on average about 7 fish species and 20 individuals, while undegraded reef-flat areas of the same size on a nearby reef supported on average 35 fish species and 150 individuals. Within 12 months of deployment, three sets of the artificial reef structures were supporting on average 35 fish species and 150-300 individuals but the least topographically complex set only contained on average 20 species of fish and 100 individuals. Although the abundance and diversity of fish colonizing the structures seemed to indicate successful rehabilitation of the fish community, multivariate analysis showed that the fish community structure was still markedly dissimilar to that of undegraded reef-flat sites. Colonization of the structures by algae and invertebrates was also rapid. Structures were initially colonized by filamentous green algae (7 days), then barnacles (14 days), and subsequently by a diverse invertebrate community (6-8 weeks). First coral recruits (Pocillopora damicornis) were observed 6.5 months after emplacement, and within 11 months P. verrucosa, Acropora spp. and Porites spp. had recruited to the largest and most complex artificial structures.

This experimental study focuses in testing a H-Darrieus VAWT prototype in different turbulent conditions inside the wind tunnel, in order to study the influence of turbulence intensity, integral length scales and Reynolds number. Passive grids are used to increase the wind tunnel free stream turbulence up to I-u= 15%, with integral length scales of L-ux = 0.18 m and Reynolds numbers of Re-D approximate to 300,000.

In Sydney Harbour (NSW, Australia), approximately 50% of the shore is composed of retaining seawalls or other built habitats. Intertidal seawalls and other similar structures provide new surfaces for colonisation by benthic organisms and therefore provide new intertidal habitats for estuarine animals and plants. They have the potential to supplement natural habitat by supporting natural assemblages, in terms of species composition and relative abundances. Alternatively, artificial structures may support only a subset of natural assemblages, provide habitat for additional species not found on nearby rocky shores, or provide habitat in which some species are consistently missing and additional species found (a combination of the previous two models). Understanding the ecological role that seawalls and other intertidal structures have in urbanised estuaries is important in planning of developments along foreshores. This study compared intertidal assemblages, at each of three different heights among seawalls and nearby horizontal and vertical rocky shores to specifically test the model that seawalls support the same assemblages of animals and plants as are found on natural rocky reefs. Hypotheses from this model were tested at three study locations by measuring abundances of animals and plants in quadrats in replicate sites on each structure. Results indicated that, at mid- and highshore levels, there were frequent differences between assemblages on natural shores and seawalls. In contrast, at lower levels, differences between assemblages on seawalls and vertical rocky reefs were small compared to differences between sites on each structure. Nevertheless, it appeared that the seawalls and rocky shores examined supported a similar suite of species and most differences were due to relative abundances and frequencies of occurrence of the species present. It is, however, premature to conclude that seawalls support similar assemblages to rocky shores until more intensive sampling has been done, specifically to search for rare species. In addition, until we have more knowledge on ecological processes in these assemblages, seawalls should not be considered as surrogates for natural shores.

Results from selected charging-discharging cycles are presented, these include different scheduling schemes and pressure ranges. Overall, results indicate that the experimental system consistently demonstrated a high thermal efficiency (> 93%) across hundreds of charging cycles. Operating pressure range and charging schedule play a limited role on the hydro-pneumatic process, whereas seasonal temperature changes play a more significant role, in that such changes can slightly alter the effective storage capacity of the system.

Though person-based PlFs like morale, motivation, and attitude (MMA) play an important role in shaping performance, it is nearly impossible to assess such PIFs directly. However, it is possible to measure behavioral indicators (e.g. compliance, use of information) that can provide insight regarding the state of the unobservable person-based PIFs. One common approach to measuring these indicators is to carry out a self-reported questionnaire survey. Significant work has been done to make such questionnaires reliable, but the potential validity problem associated with any questionnaire is that the data are subjective and thus may bear a limited relationship to reality. This paper describes the use of a virtual environment to measure behavioral indicators, which in turn can be used as proxies to assess otherwise unobservable PlFs like MMA. A Bayesian Network (BN) model is first developed to define the relationship between person-based PlFs and measurable behavioral indicators. The paper then shows how these indicators can be measured using evidence collected from a virtual environment of an offshore petroleum installation. A study that focused on emergency evacuation scenarios was done with 36 participants. The participants were first assessed using a multiple choice test. They were then assessed based on their observed performance during simulated offshore emergency evacuation conditions. A comparison of the two assessments demonstrates the potential benefits and challenges of using virtual environments to assess behavioral indicators, and thus the person-based PlFs.

It has been predicted that the addition of new habitats to an area can lead to increases in species abundance and diversity. We tested this hypothesis by contrasting assemblages of subtidal epibiota on natural reef and six common urban surfaces in Sydney Harbour, Australia. All surfaces were in shallow water and consisted of rocky reef, sandstone (brick) retaining walls, fibreglass and concrete pontoons, concrete pilings and wooden pilings with bark and stripped of bark. Assemblages of epibiota on sandstone surfaces (natural rocky reefs and sandstone retaining walls) differed from non-sandstone surfaces. The major distinguishing features of sandstone surfaces were the large cover of coralline algae and small number of taxa. Assemblages on pilings and pontoons were most different from those on sandstone surfaces and relatively similar to each other. There were, however, some differences which seemed to be consistent with features such as type of surface (concrete vs wood) and arrangement of surface (floating pontoons vs fixed pilings). We suggest that artificial structures may increase the abundance and diversity of subtidal epibiota in the shallow areas of an estuary, but are not surrogate surfaces for epibiotic assemblages that occur on nearby natural rock. It would appear that urbanisation of estuarine habitats has consequences for the identity, diversity and abundance of subtidal epibiota. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Furthermore, the influence of several parameters on the wave load of the structure and the induced dynamic characteristics is studied, including the water column height, the distance between the water column and structure, and the structure stiffness. The results show that the amplification of the wave load on the bottom of structure is greater than that on the upper part of the structure.

Data from local mast at 30, 80, and 100 m were used, with extrapolations to 80-m and 100-m turbine hub heights accomplished based on 30-m turbulence intensity observations. Trained over a 2-year period (2011-2012), the method was validated on year 2013.Similarly to the onshore application, the method was reliable in extrapolating wind speed to both 80 m and 100 m, with bias within 5%, NRMSE = 0.20 and r = 0.94. Conversely, scores were largely better than at the onshore site in predicting the annual energy yield, biased by 0.41-1.02% at 80 m, and 1.12-1.36% at 100 m. The method proved to be highly sensitive to the stability classification, as not considering this option increased its biases to 4.51-5.93% at 80 m, and 7.46-8.23% at 100 m.

There is a general trend of decreasing grain size from south to north that is associated with improvement in sorting, particularly in the tidal flat. The northward fining of the sediment suggests that the sediment in the study area is transported from south to north. The trend of northward decrease in the mean grain size is locally distorted at the river mouths, creeks end man-made structures. The contribution of the man-made structures to the observed distortion can not be separated from that of natural structures owing to the fact that these man-made structures were placed next to the natural features. The data collected from the Msasani Beach were subjected to factor analysis. Four factors account for more than 95% of the observed variations in the grain size distribution in the study area. These factors are: medium energy environments (66.5% of total variance) common at the beach slope; low energy environments found in micro-bays (16%); high energy environment found at the tidal creeks and river entrance (7.8%); and intermediate (between medium and low) energy environments common in the tidal flat (5.6%).Most of the beach slope samples are unimodal (87%), while a significant number of the tidal flat samples (46%) are bimodal, with the most common mode being 2.25 phi. The bimodality observed in this study can be attributed to the presence of shell fragments that were not removed during sieving, to sudden fluctuation in the energy strength at the beach, and to mixing of different grain populations.

It is increasingly argued that hosts and their microbiota must be studied together as 'holobionts' to better understand the effects of environmental stressors on host functioning. Disruptions of host-microbiota interactions by environmental stressors can negatively affect host performance and survival. Substantial ecological impacts are likely when the affected hosts are habitat-forming species (e. g., trees, kelps) that underpin local biodiversity. In marine systems, coastal urbanisation via the addition of artificial structures is a major source of stress to habitat formers, but its effect on their associated microbial communities is unknown. We characterised kelp-associated microbial communities in two of the most common and abundant artificial structures in Sydney Harbour-pier-pilings and seawalls-and in neighbouring natural rocky reefs. The kelp Ecklonia radiata is the dominant habitat-forming species along 8000 km of the temperate Australian coast. Kelp-associated microbial communities on pilings differed significantly from those on seawalls and natural rocky reefs, possibly due to differences in abiotic (e. g., shade) and biotic (e. g., grazing) factors between habitats. Many bacteria that were more abundant on kelp on pilings belonged to taxa often associated with macroalgal diseases, including tissue bleaching in Ecklonia. There were, however, no differences in kelp photosynthetic capacity between habitats. The observed differences in microbial communities may have negative effects on the host by promoting fouling by macroorganisms or by causing and spreading disease over time. This study demonstrates that urbanisation can alter the microbiota of key habitat-forming species with potential ecological consequences.",,,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,36,0,47,,,,2055-5008,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New South Wales, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, AustraliaSydney Inst Marine Sci, 19 Chowder Bay Rd, Mosman, NSW 2088, AustraliaNanyang Technol Univ, Singapore Ctr Environm Life Sci Engn, 60 Nanyang Dr,SBS-01N-27, Singapore 637551, SingaporeUniv New South Wales, Appl Marine & Estuarine Ecol Lab, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, AustraliaUniv New South Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",,,,2018-01-17,WOS:000429481300001,29367878,

Synthesis modules enable the interactive design problem definition, usage of multiple optimization solvers (Monte Carlo- and fractional factorial experiment-based evolution strategies (ES-MC and ES-FFE), sequential linear programming (SLP), multiobjective genetic algorithms (MOGA), and multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO)) and five-dimensional graphic views of the Pareto frontier in design and attribute spaces. The methodology combines the fast concept exploration of design variants using generic finite element modelling (FEM) models and a two-step decision support procedure (based on topology and scantling optimization) in the concept design phase.

This paper shows that the commonly adopted approach to compiling the wave scatter diagram and the subsequent selection of characteristic individual wave height and period pairs for analysis purposes will almost invariably lead to bias in the estimation of fatigue lives. A statistical argument is developed to show the sources and nature of this bias. This is supported by fatigue calculations based on individual wave data collected in the northern North Sea. It is found that the current practice in most cases introduces a substantial conservative bias into estimated fatigue lives. An alternative procedure for producing wave scatter diagrams and selecting wave heights and periods for subsequent finite-element analysis is presented which should lead to unbiased (or at least much less biased) estimates of fatigue lives.

It has been argued that this effect should be considered during decisions over their removal during decommissioning. In the North Sea, leaving such structures in place is prohibited but derogations are allowed for large concrete installations. To assess removal options for one such installation, the Halfweg GBS (gravity-based structure) a concrete platform foundation off the Dutch coast, we studied the resident fouling macrofauna community. The faunal structure, biomass and trophic composition of the Halfweg was then compared with those from the surrounding seabed sediments, other local artificial structures and a natural rocky reef.In total, 65 macrofaunal species were observed on the concrete (52 species), steel legs (32) and surrounding rock dump (44) of Halfweg. Mean Simpson diversity per sample was highest on the rock dump (0.71) but concrete (0.54) and steel (0.60) of the GBS were lower than seabed (0.69). Ten of the species observed on the concrete were not reported on other substrates while 10 of the species were also observed in the surrounding seabed. The GBS structure was numerically dominated by Arthropoda which comprised 98% of the total abundance. Mean ash free dry weight (AFDW) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) on the Halfweg substrates (204 g AFDW per m2) than in the surrounding seabed (65 g AFDW per m(2)). Over 94% of the biomass on Halfweg consisted of the plumose anemone Metridium senile. While common on other reefs, this species was absent from the surrounding seabed. Macrofaunal feeding mechanisms of the concrete and rock dump communities on the GBS were similar to those of nearby sediments, although these differed from those on the Halfweg steel legs. Therefore, the presence of Halfweg alters the local community feeding modes. Multivariate analysis revealed that taxonomic structure of the GBS and other artificial structures significantly differed from that of the sedi-mentary habitats. Low numbers of non-indigenous species on Halfweg indicated that the structure does not act as a stepping stone for species invasions.Our data show that the Halfweg structures significantly increase local biodiversity and biomass. Removal of the concrete and steel legs of the GBS (leaving the rock dump) will significantly reduce local macrofauna biodiversity. The long-term impact on macrofaunal biomass is low.

The Japanese skeleton shrimp, Caprella mutica, is proving to be a highly successful non-native crustacean in coastal waters outside its native range having overcome these obstacles. In the past 40 years, C. mutica has spread from its native sub-boreal waters of north-east Asia to numerous locations in both the northern and southern hemisphere, where it has successfully established self-sustaining and thriving populations. After its first European record from the Netherlands in 1995, C. mutica spread rapidly within the North Sea and later to the west coast of Scotland and to Ireland in less than 15 years. Caprella mutica is generally associated with man-made structures and can be found in abundance on boat hulls, floating pontoons and aquaculture infrastructure clinging to fouling organisms.Species-specific traits which enable C. mutica to perform superiorly in its introduced ranges include: rapid growth, short maturation time, high reproductive activity, broad tolerance towards prevailing environmental conditions, omnivorous feeding behaviour and efficient dispersal and distribution. These traits provide excellent prerequisites for any species to colonise a variety of different microhabitats. The availability of suitable structures, however, is of paramount importance to the invasion success of C. mutica in European coastal waters and most likely elsewhere. On artificial structures directed away from the seabed, C. mutica is able to avoid benthic predation pressure and thus, to develop massive population densities. These high abundances in disturbed habitats may also reflect the species' ability to inhabit fluctuating systems better than other species. Caprella mutica was found to be competitively superior over native congeners and to show aggressive behaviour towards conspecifics. The characteristics described here are surely not unique to C. mutica and, therefore, cannot explain its success relative to other potential non-native species. They do, however, provide insight into why C. mutica has been so successful and consequently in determining whether another species may also be successful. When making these assessments, it is of particular importance to consider potential risks of the species and how important prevention or eradication may be. Although C. mutica can be assigned a potentially harmful invader, detailed knowledge on community or ecosystem level impacts are still lacking. Recommendations on management and control actions, therefore, remain insufficient.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,16,0,17,,,1874-7809,,978-94-007-0590-6,,,,,,,,,"Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Marine Stn, D-27483 Helgoland, GermanySmithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Tiburon, CA 94920 USAScottish Assoc Marine Sci, Scottish Marine Inst, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland",,,,2011-08-30,WOS:000293984800004,,

Here, we compare spatial and temporal patterns of colonization and succession of the benthic assemblage on settlement collectors (ceramic tiles) in a 13-mo mensurative experiment on a suspended artificial reef, a seafloor artificial reef, and two nearby natural reefs at Eilat, Gulf of Aqaba. We also conducted a concurrent 7-mo manipulative experiment on the suspended reef and one of the natural reefs, and monitored fish feeding behaviour on experimental collectors, to examine effects of large mobile consumers on these patterns. In both experiments, taxonomic composition as percent planar cover for the whole community or biomass for the invertebrate component differed between collector topsides, dominated by a filamentous algal matrix, and shaded undersides with a profuse assemblage of suspension- or filter-feeding invertebrates. In the mensurative experiment, we found differences in final community and invertebrate composition between sites, which clustered according to reef type (artificial vs. natural) for collector undersides. Invertebrate biomass was greater at both artificial reefs than at one (undersides) or both (topsides) natural reefs. In the manipulative experiment, we found similar differences in composition between sites/reef types as well as between treatments (exclusion vs. control), and the invertebrate biomass was greater on the artificial reef. Invertebrate biomass was greater in the exclusion treatment than the control on collector undersides, suggesting mobile consumers can affect community composition and abundance. Predominant fish species observed interacting with collectors differed between artificial and natural reefs, likely contributing to differences in patterns of colonization and succession between sites and reef types.

This paper examines patterns in the diversity and abundance of sponges to a depth of 50 m on coastal reefs off Sydney, Australia. Photo-quadrats were used to provide estimates of the species richness and percentage cover of sponges on three reefs. Sponge morphotype (i.e. encrusting or massive) was also recorded. Within-reef variation was examined by nesting three sites within each reef at each of three depths; replicate photo-quadrats (0.45 m(2), n = 5) were taken at each site. In addition, a remotely operated vehicle was used to collect voucher specimens. Over 50 species of sponge were identified, many of which have never been described. In general, sponge richness increased with depth, as did the number of erect or massive forms. In contrast, cover decreased with depth, particularly for encrusting sponges. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed considerable small-scale spatial and temporal variation in sponge distribution and abundance. A significant positive relationship between richness and cover was also apparent. In general, there were greater temporal changes in the patterns of abundance for the shallow reef assemblages at 20 m, relative to those at 30 m and 50 m.",,,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,30,0,42,,,1323-1650,,,,,,,,,,,"ENVIRONM PROTECT AUTHOR,WATER STUDIES SECT,BANKSTOWN,NSW 2200,AUSTRALIAUNIV WOLLONGONG,DEPT BIOL SCI,WOLLONGONG,NSW 2522,AUSTRALIA",ENVIRONM PROTECT AUTHOR,,,1996-01-01,WOS:A1996VR74700005,,

Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of ROVs in studying reef fishes over natural hard-bottom and small artificial reefs, there has been little application of this technology to larger artificial structures (10s of m tall and wide), We explored the utility of ROVs in rapidly characterizing an assemblage of fishes associated with an artificial reef complex in the western Gulf of Mexico (26.9-28.2 degrees N; 95.5-97.0 degrees W) dominated by partially removed and toppled oil and gas platforms. This study reports on an efficient method to sample these structures, where we integrated depth-interval transect (DIT) and continuous roving transect (CRT) protocols to document fish distribution and community structure on 14 artificial reef sites. Consistent with previous hydroacoustic studies, south Texas artificial reefs exhibited a vertically heterogeneous distribution of fishes that varied with structure orientation. These reefs were dominated by economically important lutjanids and carangids, both of which presented sampling challenges due to their patchy distribution around these vast structures. The non-uniform distribution and mobility of these dominant taxa highlight the utility of adopting roving approaches to assess fish communities on these complex structures. We conclude our study with a discussion of important logistical challenges associated with micro-ROV surveys in deepwater habitats, and potential complementary approaches to assist documentation of demersal fishes inhabiting a persistently turbid bottom layer.

Now, it is expanded to the problem of marine wind farms taking into account the singularities of the marine environment. In fact, if the maintenance problems in wind farms are so diverse like the reading of on-condition data, their synchronization and, after, their transmission, in marine wind farms the problems are bigger, including the distance from GSM antenna to transmit and read data remotely. Additionally, and not less important, there is the distance between the marine wind farms and the staff responsible by its maintenance.

Artificial reefs have been demonstrated to be a potential tool for the restoration of marine habitats. We investigated the fish assemblage on pillars supporting the oil jetties in Eilat, studying the species composition on these vertical structures; and the relationships between fish community features and the structural characteristics of these artificial reefs over time, using multivariate regression analysis. The fish assemblage on these 25-year-old structures was shown to be abundant and diverse, comprising 146 species, distributed among 35 families. The 10 most abundant species were planktivores, accounting for 78% of all individuals; the most numerous fish was Neopomacentrus miryae (Pomacentridae). Size and complexity of pillars were correlated with fish abundance, richness and diversity, and related to the availability of shelters. These community indices increased near the bottom, possibly due to behavioral preferences. High coefficient of variance (CV) values indicated high temporal variability, resulting from a pronounced recruitment of N. miryae and other common species during April 1993.

A difficulty encountered by practitioners and researchers is that an accurate modal analysis is challenging in noisy environments. The objective of this work is to develop and implement a signal denoising method based on solving the inverse singular value problem of a measured (noisy) data matrix with prescribed entries to reconstruct a filtered data matrix. The measured (noisy) impulse response function (IRF) is used to build a square or nearly square Hankel matrix. The normalized rank determination indicator (RDI) of the Hankel matrix is introduced to determine the number of prescribed non-zero singular values in the prescribed entries inverse singular value problem (PEISVP). The reconstructed (filtered) matrix must maintain the original Hankel structure, and preserve the number of non-zero singular values. Once the filtered IRF has been obtained, the complex exponential (CE) method is applied for the modal analysis. To validate the proposed method, hereafter referred to as PEISVP-CE, we undertake the numerical simulation of a five-story shear building. Once successfully validated, we apply the PEISVP-CE method to an offshore field experiment of a jacket platform under the step relaxation.

The reduction in system reliability is investigated here by running Monte-Carlo simulations in which mooring line and anchor demands and capacities are sampled from probability distributions. Demand distributions are generated through dynamic simulations with environmental conditions corresponding to the 500-year storm. Failure of mooring lines or anchors are initiated when their capacity is exceeded by their demand. The results of this research show that the reliability of the multiline system degrades significantly when progressive failures are taken into consideration.

One option is the rigs-to-reefs initiative. OSPAR and Norwegian national legislation contain provisions that allow for the creation of artificial reefs providing they do not hinder other users and do not cause significant pollution. More generally, the creation of sizeable artificial reefs using redundant offshore steel structures is only sensible if positive impacts outweigh negative impacts. At an early stage in the cessation process, we carried out an impact assessment to identify factors that would present special environmental or socio-economic risks or benefits. Thirty-nine impacts, positive and negative, were identified and grouped under the following headings: exploitable fish stocks (8); local biota (7); sediments (4); water column (2); energy and emissions (2); socio-economics (10); other (6). Techniques by which to estimate their likely severity in general and the potential for their reduction (negative impacts) or maximization (positive impacts) are summarized. Semi-quantitative severity scores for all impacts identified were assigned to each of 11 reef-creation options. These were totalled and the options were then ranked accordingly. From an environmental and ecological (including commercial fish stocks) perspective, the results indicate that reef use for protection would be a better option than use for commercial fishing, although differences between the two were not large. The rank order did not discriminate among four of the suggested reef locations. However, toppling in situ was clearly identified as the worst scenario, whereas reef creation at a relatively clean site offered the most promising perspective.",,,,,7th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and related Aquatic Habitats7th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and related Aquatic Habitats,"OCT 07-11, 1999OCT 07-11, 1999",ICES; Italian Soc Marine Biol; European Artificial Reef Res Network; Sanremo Congressi Turismo; Univ Geona; Phillips Petr; European Commiss; US Natl Marine Fisheries ServICES; Italian Soc Marine Biol; European Artificial Reef Res Network; Sanremo Congressi Turismo; Univ Geona; Phillips Petr; European Commiss; US Natl Marine Fisheries Serv,"SAN REMO, ITALYSAN REMO, ITALY",30,1,0,0,17,0,33,,,1054-3139,,,,,,,,,,,"RF Rogaland Res, N-4006 Stavanger, NorwayDames & Moore Norway, N-4006 Stavanger, Norway",RF Rogaland ResDames & Moore Norway,,,2002-10-01,WOS:000179243500048,,

The differences were identified in terms of decommissioning preparation, decommissioning technical execution, additional environmental requirements and financial security framework. In conclusion, the majority of the regulations covering the technical section are similar within all countries studied. Major differences lie in two overarching philosophies of the framework a prescriptive regime versus a goal-setting regime. Other decommissioning aspects appear to attract increasing attention, such as in expanding clarity on in situ decommissioning, residual liabilities, optimising finance related issues of decommissioning and offshore to onshore waste movement.

Following software training with 857 images, and testing of three platforms, results showed that diversity of the three platforms ranged from low (in the central North Sea) to moderate (in the northern North Sea). The two central North Sea platforms were dominated by the plumose anemone Metridium dianthus; and the northern North Sea platform showed less obvious species domination. Three different analysis criteria were created, where the method of selection of points, number of points assessed and confidence level thresholds (CT) varied: (method A) random selection of 20 points with CT 80%, (method B) stratified random of 50 points with CT of 90% and (method C) a grid approach of 100 points with CT of 90%. Performed across the three platforms, the results showed that there were no significant differences across the majority of species and comparison pairs.

In particular, floating spar-type wave energy converters are prone to large undesirable roll and pitch amplitudes caused by a dynamic instability induced by parametric resonance. Detecting this phenomenon accurately is essential as it impacts drastically on power extraction, structural loads and mooring forces. This paper presents the validation of results from a numerical model, capable of detecting parametric resonance, using experimental data. Experiments were carried out for a scaled model of the Spar-buoy OWC (Oscillating Water Column) device at a large ocean basin. The buoy uses a slack-mooring system attached to the basin floor. The scaled turbine damping effect is simulated by a calibrated orifice plate. Two different buoy draft configurations are considered to analyse the effect of different mass distributions. The numerical model considers the nonlinear Froude-Krylov forces, which allows it to capture complex hydro-dynamic phenomena associated with the six-degree-of-freedom motion of the buoy. The mooring system is simulated through a quasi-static inelastic line model. Real fluid effects are accounted for through drag forces based on the Morison's equation and determined from experimental data. The comparison of results from regular-wave tests shows good agreement, including when parametric resonance is detected. Numerical results show that parametric resonance can produce a negative impact on power extraction efficiency up to 53%.",,,,,,,,,26,2,0,0,0,0,29,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,,,,,,,"Polytech Univ Turin, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, I-10129 Turin, ItalyUniv Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, IDMEC, Av Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",,,,2020-10-06,WOS:000571448900008,,

We estimated rock temperatures at mid-high intertidal using infrared thermography during mid-day in summer, in both artificial (Rip-raps) and natural (boulder fields) habitats. We also conducted diurnal thermal surveys (every 4 hr) in four seasons at one study site. Concurrent sampling of air and seawater temperature, wind velocity, and topographic structure of habitats were considered to explore their influence on rock temperature. Rock temperature was in average 3.7 degrees C higher in the artificial breakwater in two of the three study sites, while air temperature was about 1.5-4 degrees C higher at this habitat at summer. Thermal patterns were more homogeneous across the artificial habitat. Lower species abundance and richness in the artificial breakwaters were associated with higher rock temperature. Mechanism underlying enhanced substrate temperature in the artificial structures seems related to their lower small-scale spatial heterogeneity. Our study thus highlighted that higher rock temperature in artificial breakwaters can contribute to loss of biodiversity and that integrated artificial structures may alter coastal urban microclimates, a matter that should be considered in the spatial planning of urban coastal ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,17,1,20,,,2045-7758,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, Dept Biol Marina, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile",,,,2019-11-18,WOS:000493816900001,31788225,

Current evidence suggests these systems comprise spatially heterogeneous mosaics with respect to artificial structures, pollutants and community composition, while also undergoing biotic homogenization over time. Urban marine ecosystem dynamics are often influenced by several commonly observed patterns and processes, including the loss of foundation species, changes in biodiversity and productivity, and the establishment of ruderal species, synanthropes and novel assemblages.

In contrast to traditional rigid body formulations of floating structures, the finite element method is utilized in the implemented numerical approach, which allows for direct output of local section forces and displacements for joint analysis and fatigue calculations. The numerical approach builds upon a partitioned solution procedure, constituted by individual fluid and structure domains, which are coupled through the structural equation of motion. The structural domain is handled by means of the finite element method, while large displacements and stress stiffening effects, exhibited by moored floating structures, are inherently included due to a co-rotational element formulation. The fluid domain is modeled by an appropriate water wave theory, and the hydrodynamic loads are evaluated at the instantaneous fluid-structure interface by means of a relative Morison equation. The equation of motion is solved in time domain, which makes SOFIA capable of handling bottom founded and floating space frame structures that may experience non-linear behavior. To demonstrate the applicability of the simulation tool, numerical examples of a bottom founded and a floating space frame structure are presented. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Establishing an accurate model of the offshore environment can be a challenging task. The use of simple probabilistic models may lead to biased results in the stochastic structural analysis since the environmental impact to an existing offshore structure is associated with a wide range of inter-dependent factors. In this paper, the specification of long-term design loads for offshore structures considering multiple environmental factors is investigated where the dependency between several commonly used sea state parameters are instituted through a copula-based multivariate probabilistic model. Several copula functions, capable of modeling both linear and non-linear dependence structures, are considered. The developed multivariate model based on copula concept is compared with the available approaches in the literature using actual environmental data. The modeled sea state parameters are then utilized to characterize the sea load for the reliability analysis of a real jacket structure where the prediction of the long term load is derived in a discretized form.

We evaluated the importance of 17 physical habitat, chemical, and biological variables in predicting eel density in five major river basins in Maryland. Because artificial structures impede eel migration in all five basins, only sites determined to be on unblocked streams or downstream of structures that significantly restrict eel passage were used in the analysis. Stepwise regression identified a model consisting of four variables-velocity-depth diversity, the log-transformed distance (km) to the Chesapeake Bay, the log-transformed density of noneel fishes, and the distance to a semipassable or impassable structure-as the best predictor of eel densities. When applied to a random subset of data not used for model development, the model correctly predicted 44.4% of eel densities and had a high mean prediction error ( 1.86 eels/75 m(2)) compared with the mean eel density for all sites included in model development (3.33 eels/75 m(2)). However, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted eel densities (r = 0.64; P < 0.05) indicated that the model was generally successful in predicting trends in observed densities. The study results are consistent with previous research suggesting the lack of significant eel-stream habitat associations, although the presence of a variety of velocity-depth regimes may support higher eel densities. Higher eel densities near artificial structures known to affect upstream movement suggest that eels are accumulating downstream of these structures because of impeded migration.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,24,0,36,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Appalachian Lab, Frostburg, MD 21532 USAFrostburg State Univ, Dept Biol, Frostburg, MD 21532 USA",,,,2004-05-01,WOS:000222012400003,,

Construction has been recently amplified by societal responses to reduce flood and erosion risks from rising sea levels and more extreme storms resulting from climate change. Such structures, leading to highly modified shorelines, deliver societal benefits, but they also create significant socioeconomic and environmental challenges. The planning, design and deployment of these coastal structures should aim to provide multiple goals through the application of ecoengineering to shoreline development. Such developments should be designed and built with the overarching objective of reducing negative impacts on nature, using hard, soft and hybrid ecological engineering approaches. The design of ecologically sensitive shorelines should be context-dependent and combine engineering, environmental and socioeconomic considerations. The costs and benefits of ecoengineered shoreline design options should be considered across all three of these disciplinary domains when setting objectives, informing plans for their subsequent maintenance and management and ultimately monitoring and evaluating their success. To date, successful ecoengineered shoreline projects have engaged with multiple stakeholders (e.g. architects, engineers, ecologists, coastal/port managers and the general public) during their conception and construction, but few have evaluated engineering, ecological and socioeconomic outcomes in a comprehensive manner. Increasing global awareness of climate change impacts (increased frequency or magnitude of extreme weather events and sea level rise), coupled with future predictions for coastal development (due to population growth leading to urban development and renewal, land reclamation and establishment of renewable energy infrastructure in the sea) will increase the demand for adaptive techniques to protect coastlines. In this review, we present an overview of current ecoengineered shoreline design options, the drivers and constraints that influence implementation and factors to consider when evaluating the success of such ecologically engineered shorelines.",,,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,31,0,40,,,0078-3218,,978-0-367-13415-0,,,,,,,,,"Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Natl Ctr Coasts & Climate, Melbourne, Vic 3010, AustraliaNatl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Expt Marine Ecol Lab, Singapore 117543, SingaporeUniv Hong Kong, Swire Inst Marine Sci, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaUniv Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaUniv Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Biol Geol & Ambientali BiGeA, I-40126 Bologna, ItalyUniv Bologna, Ctr Interdipartimentale Ric Sci Ambientali CIRSA, UO CoNISMa, I-40126 Bologna, ItalyUniv Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas 7001, AustraliaUniv Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, POB 49, Hobart, Tas 7001, AustraliaMacquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, AustraliaUniv Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Marine Ecol Labs A11, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Sydney, NSW 2006, AustraliaUniv Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USAXiamen Univ, Coll Ocean & Earth Sci, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R ChinaUniv Plymouth, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandUniv Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, EnglandMarine Biol Assoc UK, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, EnglandGeorges River Council, Hurstville, NSW 2220, AustraliaUniv Hong Kong, Fac Architecture, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaObject Terr, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaChinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Life Sci, Simon FS Li Marine Sci Lab, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaChinese Univ Hong Kong, Earth Syst Sci Programme, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaStevens Inst Technol, Davidson Lab, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USAECOncrete Tech LTD, POB 51528, Tel Aviv, IsraelUniv New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, AustraliaUniv New South Wales, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sydney, NSW 2052, AustraliaSydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW 2088, AustraliaNanyang Technol Univ, Singapore Ctr Environm Life Sci Engn, Singapore 637551, SingaporeEhime Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Matsuyama, Ehime, JapanCity Univ Hong Kong, State Key Lab Marine Pollut, Kowloon, Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Georges River CouncilObject TerrECOncrete Tech LTD,,,2020-06-02,WOS:000535123100005,,

Small fauna were significantly more abundant in 24 mm tubes compared with 3 mm tubes, with intermediate abundance in 12 mm tubes.

Medium fauna were more likely to be found in 12 mm tubes that matched their own body width than in 24 mm tubes. Species richness was significantly lower in the 3 mm tubes compared with the other treatments, in part because errant polychaetes, gastropods, caprellid amphipods and crabs were less likely to be found in the 3 mm tubes.

A heavily-fouled barge then translocated the ascidian to an international shipping port some 500 kin south, near the heart of the New Zealand mussel industry. The species was subsequently identified as Didemnum vexillum, but its status as indigenous or non-indigenous was disputed. Nonetheless, its presence was regarded as a significant threat to the mussel industry because of its demonstrated invasiveness on artificial structures, and its ability to over-grow and smother mussels.From the barge's mooring area, D. vexillum subsequently spread to the seabed beneath, and to nearby vessels and artificial structures (i.e., barges, recreational vessels, moorings, salmon cages and wharf piles). Given the likelihood that infected vectors would spread the ascidian to mussel farms in the region, and in consideration of a benefit-cost analysis, an eradication program for D. vexillum was instigated. This paper provides a chronology of events surrounding the initial detection and spread of the ascidian, and describes the development of incursion response tools for the different substrata that were infected. The treatments included smothering soft-sediment habitats with uncontaminated dredge spoil, wrapping wharf piles with plastic, smothering rip-rap habitats using a geotextile fabric, and various other approaches based on water blasting, air drying or chlorine dosing. While many of the response methods were completely effective at eliminating D. vexillum from different substrata, the program overall failed to eradicate the organism from the region. The reasons for this failure are documented, and the important lessons learned are highlighted, as a contribution to the successful management of invasive species in the future.

Only C. antennarius individuals recruited onto the platform, primarily into the attached community of Mytilus galloprovincialis and M. californianus at depths of < 12 to 15 m. The higher CPUE (catch per unit effort) of C. antennarius beneath the platform, compared with nearby soft bottom stations, suggested that this species remained primarily in the vicinity of the platform. Although C. anthonyi did not recruit at the platform, adult female C. anthonyi were attracted to the platform from surrounding habitat. The higher CPUE of female C. anthonyi beneath the platform, compared with soft bottom stations, suggested that habitat selection is related to reproduction in this species. C. productus and Loxorhynchus grandis were present in low numbers at all benthic stations. The distribution and abundance of these crab species fit into 3 of 4 hypothesized scenarios that described different combinations of recruitment, distribution and abundance of mobile species around oil platforms: (1) 'recruitment/emigration', a platform provides recruitment habitat and individuals that recruit to the platform emigrate at some point to the surrounding environment, (2) 'recruitment/resident', a platform provides recruitment habitat, but individuals remain in the vicinity of the structure (C. antennarius), (3) 'attraction', individuals that recruited elsewhere are attracted to and aggregate at a platform (C. anthonyi), and (4) 'visitor', individuals that recruited elsewhere occur temporarily at the platform without aggregation (C. productus, L. grandis).

Through the increase of localized structural complexity provided by the reef itself and by the fouling organisms which act as engineering species, additional protection options are offered to the ichthyic community, especially recruits. Also, the epibiont biomass represents an important link in the food web, acting either as a direct source or in the transference of energy to higher trophic levels.

There is concern about how climate change will influence human activities, including offshore engineering. Climate change will alter the metocean data used for design purposes. These changes will possibly cause some impact on the structural responses of ships and offshore structures, more specifically fatigue damage accumulation and extreme responses. These possible impacts will depend on the structure life span, structure geographic location and climate change scenario assessed, among other aspects. This paper discusses the results of dynamic stochastic analyses and long-term extreme response estimates of a Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) connected to a semi-submersible platform considering future climate change scenarios for two locations: South East Brazilian Coast and North Atlantic Ocean. The long-term response is estimated by the Environmental Contour Method (ECM). Climate change is assessed by using different climate change scenarios available. The climate change scenarios considered in this work are the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 proposed and described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Specifically, this work focuses at the influence of climate change on the wave parameters, significant wave height (Hs) and zero up-crossing period (Tz), and their impact on the structural responses of a SCR, for both locations aforementioned.The results obtained suggest that climate change can affect the structure response in different ways, depending on the geographic location. They show an increasing trend for the long-term structural response in the Brazilian location and a slight decreasing trend for the North Atlantic Ocean location. However, these results show high variability due to considerable uncertainties in the ocean climate forecasts, related mainly to shortcomings in global climate models.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0141-1187,1879-1549,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Lab Anal & Reliabil Offshore Struct, COPPE, Civil Engn Program, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,,,2020-02-12,WOS:000509631800023,,

In this context, fatigue and fracture related degradation play a vital role. Hence, this paper discusses the state of the art as well as two major methodologies used for fatigue life prediction of structures and mechanical items. The first (S-N approach) is based on experimentally derived S-N curves and linear damage rule (LDR). Since LDR does not take sequence effect of loading into account the S-N approach often leads to overestimation / underestimation of fatigue life. Hence, this paper also takes into simultaneous consideration the second approach, which relies on the principles of fracture mechanics (FM) and crack growth analysis. Furthermore, the paper discusses damage tolerance analysis (DTA) and the role of Risk Based Inspection (RBI) to detect cracks before they grow to a critical level and cause catastrophic failure of the component. Thereafter, the paper discusses the reliability of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) methods quantified in terms of Probability of Detection (PoD), to identify the flaw size and location. Finally, probabilistic crack growth (PCG) models used for remaining useful life estimation (RULE) and for planning inspection regimes of structural and mechanical items are discussed briefly.",,,,,"34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015","Amer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivAmer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","St John's, CANADASt John's, CANADA",12,0,0,0,0,0,12,,,,,978-0-7918-5650-5,,,,,,,,,"Univ Stavanger, Dept Mech & Struct Engn & Mat Sci, Stavanger, Norway",,,,2016-06-15,WOS:000375807500018,,

This imposes a high risk for extensive structural failures while various deterioration mechanisms may degrade the available capacity of the structures. Thus, no reliable decisions can be reached regarding design, operation, and survivability of the structures unless a deep comprehension of their fatigue performance is available, including welding induced residual stresses. In particular, the continuous increase in size of the weldments for the offshore wind industry needs special attention with regard to welding-induced residual stresses, as they can reduce fatigue life, promote distortion, and contribute to stress corrosion cracking. Thus, the current design methods and increased structural dimensions as well as new design and manufacturing methods need to be inspected, understood, and optimized. Related to this, there is a growing need for evaluation of the effect of welding methods with various heat input density distributions. This article deals with the influence of welding method on the welding-induced residual stresses in 10-mm-thick low-carbon structural steel plates. The residual stresses are investigated in hybrid laser-arc welded and submerged arc butt-welded steel plates by means of experimental temperature profile measurements and neutron diffraction measurements and in accordance with existing production procedures. The residual stresses were measured at three different depths in the plates. The goal of the analysis is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the distribution and development of residual stresses in relation to the welding method for better control of the residual stresses and distortion.

In Taiwan, where the further development of nuclear power is suspended due to public antinuclear sentiment, offshore wind farms have been heavily promoted as a way of meeting electricity demand. The planned site for offshore wind farms, mainly the intertidal zone along the coast of Changhua County, overlaps with both oyster farms and the habitat of Taiwanese humpbacked dolphins, categorized as a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This has resulted in a clash between conserving the oyster farming landscape, protecting an endangered species, and developing green energy. Facing this dilemma, pro-wind farm discourses that highlight concerns about global climate change have gradually supplanted those stressing the welfare of oysters and dolphins, even though the latter have been used successfully as local icons by movements opposing previous development projects on the intertidal zone. This article reconsiders the politics of territorialization implied by the green label affixed to offshore wind farm projects and other forms of green energy in general. As such, the meaning of offshore wind farms, as a newly discovered energy resource, is intertwined with the changing meanings of both dolphins and oyster farms, as rival nonhuman objects of resource exploitation and natural conservation. The territorialization of such resources in the emerging discursive space of green energy has proceeded via relational placemaking with nonlinear connections among multiple human and nonhuman elements.

Corrosion acceleration is possible by modifying physical and/or electrochemical properties involved in the redox reactions. In this work the first option was chosen. Based on a literature review temperature and dissolved oxygen level were concluded to be the most influencing parameters. Several test scenarios with different combinations of sea water temperature and dissolved oxygen level have been defined. Corresponding S-N curves have been constructed for HSLA steel (type DNV F460) specimens immersed in natural seawater. The direct current potential drop technique was used to quantify damage evolution for all tested scenarios.

Anthropogenic practices that facilitate species introductions must be identified and modified to improve management and control the spread of non-native taxa in many environments. Maintenance practices that remove dense epifaunal invertebrates attached to offshore structures create a disturbance that may facilitate the establishment of non-native species.2. We evaluated the effect of disturbance on the abundance (percent cover) of a nonnative bryozoan, Watersipora subatra, on an offshore oil platform in the Santa Barbara Channel, USA by removing the existing epifaunal community in experimental plots and comparing Watersipora cover in these plots to that in undisturbed control plots over a 15-month period. We explored the importance of larval supply and the epifaunal community in driving observed patterns, using measurements of Watersipora larval availability and colony recruitment and growth in the disturbed and control plots. We also examined the effect of disturbance on Watersipora establishment at the larger, platform-scale over c. 18 months with comparative surveys of cleaned and uncleaned portions of another oil platform.3. Both the experimental disturbance and the larger platform cleaning facilitated Watersipora establishment, with cover increasing from c. 5% to 20-60% at shallower (<= 12 m) depths within 15 to 18 months following disturbance.4. Initial Watersipora recruitment to the disturbed plots occurred during a period of elevated larval availability, as indicated by recruitment onto settlement plates. However, 1 year after the experimental disturbance, sessile invertebrates occupied all available settlement space, and there was little recruitment of Watersipora into disturbed plots despite the availability of larvae.5. Synthesis and applications. Maintenance operations for offshore structures can include the manual removal of subtidal epibenthic invertebrates attached to the structure. Our study at offshore oil platforms found that this anthropogenic disturbance enhanced the establishment of the non-native invertebrate Watersipora subatra. The timing of disturbance relative to Watersipora's reproductive season was an important driver of this pattern. Scheduling maintenance practices to occur soon after the reproductive period of Watersipora could allow adequate time for native species to recruit and occupy the available bare space, thereby reducing the potential for establishment of this non-native species.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,7,0,9,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUS Dept Interior, Bur Ocean Energy Management, Camarillo, CA USA",,,,2018-06-28,WOS:000434970200003,,

Structural damages and failures are catastrophic due to wave impact and it is necessary to understand the influence of breaking wave impact on the structural members. The standard codal provisions of breaking wave impact on structural members is scarce, it is essential to understand the physics of the interaction of breaking waves on structural members. In the present study, an experimental investigation has been carried out to measure the response of the slender vertical cylinder under breaking waves due to constant amplitude spectrum. The structural response of the vertical cylinder under constant amplitude spectrum was found from the measured acceleration. The deflection of the vertical cylinder due to breaking wave impact from acceleration measurements were found out by using omega arithmetic method. The acceleration and deflection are found to be maximum for both severe and moderate plunging events. The maximum deflection observed for severe plunging event is nearly 0.1m for the present study.

Support structures affect costs associated with the balance of system and operation and maintenance. Understanding the link between these costs and the main environmental design drivers is crucial in the quest for a lower levelized cost of energy, and it is the main rationale for this work. Actual cost and engineering data are still scarce; hence, we evaluated a simplified engineering approach to tie key site and turbine parameters (e.g. water depth, wave height, tower-head mass, hub height and generator rating) to the overall support weight. A jacket-and-tower sizing tool, part of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's system engineering software suite, was utilized to achieve mass-optimized support structures for 81 different configurations. This tool set provides preliminary sizing of all jacket components. Results showed reasonable agreement with the available industry data, and that the jacket mass is mainly driven by water depth, but hub height and tower-head mass become more influential at greater turbine ratings. A larger sensitivity of the structural mass to wave height and target eigenfrequency was observed for the deepest water conditions (>40m). Thus, techno-economic analyses using this model should be based on accurate estimates of actual metocean conditions and turbine parameters especially for deep waters. The relationships derived from this study will inform National Renewable Energy Laboratory's offshore balance of system cost model, and they will be used to evaluate the impact of changes in technology on offshore wind lower levelized cost of energy.

More stringent regulations, including reduced catch quotas and restrictions on the shrimp fishery to reduce bycatch of juvenile snappers, are anticipated. However, with projected rebuilding, maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is estimated to be between 11 and 25 million pounds. This exceeds previously recorded annual yields from U. S. Gulf waters. The fishery began during the mid 19th century off the northeastern Gulf coast, with harvests of only about 2 million pounds. Even at this rate, the stocks were depleted rapidly, and the fleets moved further south and east to find new sources. Numerous exploratory cruises to the western Gulf in the late 19th century found minimal snapper populations, but high concentrations discovered off Vera Cruz, Mexico, attracted fishers, and this area was the major source of snappers for more than a century. The deployment of petroleum structures in the mid 20th century in the western Gulf and thousands of artificial reefs in the north-central Gulf have markedly increased red snapper habitat in those areas. Currently, snapper populations around artificial reefs in the north-central and northwestern Gulf support the majority of the U. S. harvest. If habitat is limiting, the designations of overfishing and overfished may be misleading, and unrealized harvest potential may be a more accurate descriptor of the current status of the stock given the increased presence of additional habitat for red snapper.

We surveyed from Poole to Selsey where isolated populations had become extinct, and the Isle of Wight where some populations had persisted. We found evidence that since TBT restrictions, recolonization and colonization by N. lapillus has been rapid. By 2007-2008, of the eleven surveyed mainland sites, seven were colonized, although indications of reduced imposex impacts were mixed. Distribution had also extended on the Isle of Wight and populations were larger with less imposex impact in sites with long term populations. The lack of continuous suitable habitat blocks and the hydrodynamic complexity of the region, leads us to hypothesize that recovery has been facilitated by man-made structures which may be acting as 'stepping stones'. Populations that have become established on engineered structures such as sea walls, breakwaters and rock groynes demonstrate accelerated recovery in the region as TBT in the environment has generally declined. Sites with suitable substrates and food sources near to ports were either not recolonized or had small populations with imposex evident.

In view of this complete dependence upon fossil fuels, investigations into the prospects of diversifying electrical generation by resorting to renewable energy technologies are particularly relevant. The archipelago has peculiar characteristics such as high population density, comparatively deep coastal waters and an economy based on tourism, manufacturing, marine-sector activities and services that make the integration of wind power generation projects challenging. Local government authorities commissioned the authors to assess the constraints related to wind farm development in a shallow water coastal area, known as is-Sikka l-Bajda, which could present a wind potential worth exploiting, and to recommend adequate mitigation measures to minimize any impacts and conflicts with stakeholders. These constraints include marine navigational aspects, fishing and aquaculture, tourism and other site-specific activities. Environmental constraints exist including the fact that the site is characterized by extensive seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) meadows, that it is a priority habitat under the EU Habitats Directive, and that the site itself is a reef-another priority habitat within the same directive. The proposed near-shore site is also in the vicinity of a protected coastal bird rafting and bird nesting site for the Yelkouan Shearwater species. Submarine noise generation-particularly during the construction phase -is also of concern in view of the regular sighting of marine mammals in Maltese coastal waters. In the site evaluation exercise, another secondary site in the Maltese Islands, located off the north Gozo coast, was also assessed. Mitigation measures specific to the Sikka l-Bajda site proposed by the authors include the deployment of silt curtains, bubble screens and unobtrusive turbine lighting devices and avoiding utilisation of the reef area closest to the protected bird colony. Such measures also relate to the choice of the array design to minimise visual impact and to the period of the year when wind plant construction and deployment should take place to minimize impact on avifaunal populations. By declaring the marine area contiguous to the proposed nearshore wind facility development as off-limits to fishing vessels, a de facto 'No-take' Marine Protected Area can also be effectively instituted. One also expects submerged components of the nearshore wind facility to be colonized within a brief period by a diverse fouling community and that the same components act as Fish Aggregating Devices (FAD's), greatly enhancing fish populations in the area. In view of the current paucity in Mediterranean nearshore wind power facilities, the proposed project could potentially serve as a pilot project for the whole region, and also become a tourist attraction.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,0309-524X,2048-402X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Malta, Inst Sustainable Energy, Triq Il Barrakki, Marsaxlokk MXK 1531, MaltaUniv Malta, Phys Oceanog Unit, Msida, MaltaToday Publ Policy Inst, Chamber Commerce & Enterprise, Valletta, MaltaUniv Malta, Dept Phys, Msida, MaltaUniv Malta, Inst Sustainable Energy, Marsaxlokk, Malta",Today Publ Policy Inst,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000210773300005,,

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approaches using blade geometry resolved models are computationally expensive. Therefore, most array models use source term representations of rotors, normally actuator disk, actuator line or blade element disk. Unfortunately, these methods rarely capture enough physics to accurately predict power and at the same time correctly characterise the wake velocity field and turbulent structures.This study describes a new Generalised Actuator Disk CFD model (GAD-CFD), that achieves the required accuracy for the simulation of horizontal axis wind and tidal turbines and their wakes. This new method combines a finite volume CFD code with additional source terms representing the rotor, including: correct consideration of losses along the foil by modification of the distribution of downwash; a concise downwash distribution computation; recognition that foil cross section varies along the length; dynamically changing Reynolds numbers and the application of a tip radius correction. Also reported are foil lift and drag coefficients and their variation with thickness, surface roughness and Reynolds number, which is necessary for the proper characterisation the whole rotor.The effectiveness of this approach is investigated and validated against two experiments, and demonstrates improvements over traditional source term methods, in particular the correct CFD approach to tip losses and consequent downstream wake prediction. This study provides confidence in application to both small scale flume studies and large scale array deployments in both the marine and wind environments. (C) 2020 The Authors.

However, whether these potential impacts represent real ones, such that they cause detectable trends in population levels, remains unknown. Changes in population dynamics of seabirds are driven primarily by rates of reproduction and adult and juvenile survival, all three of which are impacted by foraging success. Therefore, revealing precisely how MREIs can affect seabird foraging success through changes in foraging behaviour is key to understanding whether large-scale installations could have impacts at a population level. Discussion focuses on how to define foraging habitat and how MREIs might impact those habitats and foraging behaviour indirectly by changes in oceanographic processes and prey characteristics. Foraging behaviours are also likely to be more directly impacted by MREIs, so focus here is also on how changes in foraging behaviour during the more constrained breeding season can influence reproductive output by altering individual energy budgets. A third and more-direct potential impact of MREIs on foraging behaviour is changes in diving behaviour.

In the present work the artificial structures of Senigallia and Portonovo were considered after about sixteen years from their construction to observe how they altered in the time, as well as the effects on sea-bottom morphology due to the whole reef and on terrain changes around individual reef units.Senigallia reef placed at about 15 nm North-West from Ancona, represents one-oasis model and was built-up at a depth of 11 m, about 1.2 nm offshore, on a sandymuddy seabed far from natural hard substrates. The reef was constructed in 1987 and consists of 29 pyramids, each made of five 2-m cubic concrete blocks, and twelve concrete cages (6x4x5 m) for shellfish culture placed in a rectangular arrangement. Portonovo reef was deployed in 1988 in Portonovo Bay (Conero Promontory) on sandy bottom at a depth of 10 m. It consists of 87 pyramids and 36 cages arranged in three oasis of the same type as Senigallia reef and placed about 100 in from each other. It is placed at about 10 nm South-East from Ancona and 0.5 nm offshore. The main difference between the two reefs is their geographical position: Senigallia reef is an open area, exposed to winds between NW-SE and currents that run parallel to the shoreline a protected from winds and currents due to the indented coastline of the promontory.The two artificial reefs were investigated through the Kongsberg-Simrad multibeam EM-3000 system to evaluate terrain changes around the structures. EM-3000 bathymetric system mounted on research M/N Tecnopesca II belonging to ISMAR - CNR of Ancona, operates at a frequency of 300 kHz, fanning out up to 127 acoustic beams at a maximum ping rate of 25 Hz and at an angle of 140degrees (1.5degreesx1.5degrees beams are spaced 0.9degrees apart). This yielded swaths that were up to similar to4 times the water depth. The position of the boat was obtained via 24-hour, differential global positioning system (DGPS) navigation connected to a geostationary satellite, an Anshutz Standard 20 gyrocompass and a sound velocimeter. With differential GPS, the system was capable of cm resolution with a depth accuracy of 10-15 cm RMS and a horizontal positional accuracy of less than I in. The swath survey bathymetry was processed using the Simrad Neptune software. Post-processing steps included the cleaning of the navigation, then tidal corrections were applied to the depth soundings using verified downloaded tide data. Processed depth soundings from the EM-3000 system were available as ASCII xyz files. Their processing using Roxar C-floor software was the next step to obtain 3D images of the the same direction; while the Portonovo reef is more reefs.",,,,,MTS/IEEE Conference on Celebrating the Past - Teaming Toward the FutureMTS/IEEE Conference on Celebrating the Past - Teaming Toward the Future,"SEP 22-26, 2003SEP 22-26, 2003",Marine Technol Soc; IEEE; OES; Scripps Inst OceanogMarine Technol Soc; IEEE; OES; Scripps Inst Oceanog,"San Diego, CASan Diego, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,0-933957-30-0,,,,,,,,,"CNR, ISMAR, I-00185 Rome, Italy",,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000221420300184,,

This paper explicitly addresses this gap and explores how and why certain stakeholders rationalise potential impacts on the tourism economy of coastal communities and, thus constitute the conflict between offshore wind farms and tourism. Based on two cases studies in Scotland and Germany, five storylines are identified that are invoked by local opponents to substantiate impacts on tourism. The paper will show that a particular meaningful construction of the coastal landscape is inherent in tourism and pervades all storylines.

Eels approaching the trash rack swam through the rack (40.5%) but also showed turning behaviour at (44.7%) or in front of the rack (14.7%). Eels approaching the rack had varying body positions, predominantly head or tail first, but also curled up into a ball or drifted sideways.

Groups of many moderate-sized piles are replaced by a few very large diameter piles; excavation of shallow soft sediments is replaced by the use of deep skirts, transferring the effective foundation depth to the level of the skirt tips, or by forcing footings to penetrate several diameters into the seabed; underwater installation has allowed the use of 'suction' (or under-pressure) to aid installation of skirted foundations and caissons. Emphasis in design is focused more on capacity, paying particular attention to the effects of cyclic loading but generally with less concern on deformations compared with onshore design.

This study has collected more than 1,000 offshore and concurrent onshore site records from the K-NET and SEMS projects. These data are compared statistically in terms of the peak ground accelerations (PGA), the vertical-to-horizontal (V/H) PGA ratios, the normalized earthquake response spectra of the horizontal and vertical components and the corresponding vertical-to horizontal (V/H) ratios. The analysis indicates that in the same earthquake event and with identical epicenter distances, the offshore horizontal PGA has greater amplification than the onshore. Meanwhile, the V/H PGA ratio of the offshore ground motions is much smaller than that of the onshore counterparts due to the effects of seafloor soft sediments and water layer. For offshore earthquake response spectra (both H & V), the peak spectral plateau occurs at longer periods than for the onshore records. Also, the offshore response spectra at moderate and long periods gain greater amplifications, which is critical to bottom fixed offshore structures. The V/H ratios of earthquake response spectra, offshore versus onshore, exhibit different trends varying with periods. Finally, to fill up the gap of current seismic design of offshore structures, two reference design response spectra (both H & V) by spectral fitting have been proposed for the engineering use.

The two main species involved were Herring and Lesser Black-backed Gulls, with records received of 11047 pairs and 2544 pairs, respectively. Estimated numbers may be as high as 16900 pairs of Herring Gulls and 3200 pairs of Lesser Black-backed Gulls, constituting 8.2% and 3.6%, respectively, of the total breeding populations of these species in Britain and Ireland. Since 1976, gulls nesting on buildings have continued to increase, both in terms of the number of breeding pairs (Herring Gulls by 10% per annum; Lesser Black-backed Gulls by 17% per annum) and the number of sites colonized (Herring Gulls by 5% per annum; Lesser Black-backed Gulls by 13% per annum). This increase has been greatest in the Lesser Black-backed Gull, but that of the Herring Gull is of particular interest as its numbers in Britain and Ireland have declined during this period. Records were received of 236 pairs of Common Gulls and 11 pairs of Great Black-backed Gulls nesting on buildings. In most areas, coastal towns have now been colonized by roof-nesting gulls and sites further inland are being colonized, especially by Lesser Black-backed Culls. There has been an increased colonization of industrial sites in towns since 1976 and this has led to the formation of much denser colonies than previously found in urban areas. Small colonies of Herring Gulls nesting on rooftops increase in size at a higher rate than large colonies, although the actual numerical increase is still greater in larger colonies. There is Mo evidence of established colonies of roof-nesting gulls disappearing naturally and the rapid increase in size of small colonies means that they become established very quickly, often before they are perceived as a problem. Considerable effort has been put into attempting to reduce the numbers of gulls nesting in some towns. As yet, however, no successful management methods have been developed.",,,,,,,,,50,0,2,0,45,0,59,,,0006-3657,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1997-03-01,WOS:A1997WN62000002,,

These processes affect sediment and pollutant transport, acoustic transmissions and man-made structures in the shallow and deep oceans. Previous studies of the role of ISWs in suspending seafloor sediments and forming marine nepheloid layers were mainly conducted in shallow-water environments. In summer 2017, we observed at least four thick (70-140 m) benthic nepheloid layers (BNLs) at water depths between 956 and 1545 m over continental slopes in the northern South China Sea. We found there was a good correlation between the timing of the ISW packet and variations of the deepwater suspended sediment concentration (SSC). At a depth of 956 m, when the ISW arrived, the near-bottom SSC rapidly increased by two orders of magnitude to 0.62 mg/l at 8 m above the bottom. At two much deeper stations, the ISW-induced horizontal velocity reached 59.6-79.3 cm/s, which was one order of magnitude more than the seafloor contour currents velocity. The SSC, 10 m above the sea floor, rapidly increased to 0.10 mg/l (depth of 1545 m) and 1.25 mg/l (depth of 1252 m). In this study, we found that ISWs could suspend much more sediments on deepwater areas than previously thought. Specifically, we estimated that ISWs could induce and suspend 78.7 Mt/yr of sediment from shelf to deep-sea areas of the northern South China Sea. The total amount of sediment resuspended by shoaling ISWs was 2.7 times that of river-derived sediment reaching the northern South China Sea. This accounted for 6.1% of the global river-discharged sediment (16.4% of that from Asian rivers) transported to the sea.",,,,,,,,,45,9,0,0,21,0,52,,,2045-2322,,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China, Shandong Prov Key Lab Marine Environm & Geol Engn, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaQingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Geol, Qingdao 266061, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaState Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 1, Key Lab Marine Sedimentol & Environm Geol, Qingdao 266061, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaNorth Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USAQingdao Inst Marine Geol, Key Lab Gas Hydrate, Minist Nat Resources, Qingdao 266071, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaOcean Univ China, CIMST, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaMinist Educ, Key Lab Marine Environm & Ecol, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R China",State Ocean AdmMinist Educ,,,2019-09-04,WOS:000481747100037,31431636,

Substantial and permanent seafloor deformation constitutes a severe geohazard for these marine structures and associated offshore elements/components. This paper addresses the response of seabed sand deposits subjected to underlying dip-slip fault movement. The resulting propagation of the faulting offset in seabed sediments is explored using 2D finite element modeling in Abaqus (c) while accounting for nonlinear soil behavior with strain softening. A 2D plain strain FEM seabed model is adopted to investigate the effect of different seabed soil properties and layer thicknesses on the extent and magnitude of seabed surface deformation induced by normal and reverse faults with different dip angles. The results indicate that (1) the adoption of sand properties that depend on depth is necessary to realistically model the fault propagation mechanism, particularly for fault propagation through thick and dense sand deposits, (2) the presentation of fault propagation results in a normalized manner (with respect to sand cover thickness) does not eliminate the dependency on the actual layer thickness, and (3) the deformation of the beds in the cover as a result of basement faulting can be modeled realistically using trishear kinematic approaches.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,1,16,,,0013-7952,1872-6917,,,,,,,,,,"Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 11-0236, Riad El Solh 11072020, Lebanon",,,,2018-05-08,WOS:000430780300014,,

Possible conditions outside the normal process are examined in detail and the consequences assessed. The HAZOP analysis help to identify the hazard work conditions by splitting the project into manageable sections, allowing the team to focus on specific goals and parameters. Furthermore, the possible deviations are identified and compared with standard operations and the design characteristics.The purpose of this study is to identify and discuss the common factors studied in the HAZOP analysis in relation to maintenance of subsea petroleum production systems. The paper gives an overview of how the HAZOP analysis is developed before the maintenance interventions start and how the results and corrective actions are managed. It describes how the risk scenarios are visualized by the service providers, suppliers and the O&G operators during the HAZOP meetings. The experience of specialists participating in and analyzing the scenarios is fundamental to completing the interventions successfully.The use of assessment tools in the O&G industry will be maintained and increased over the coming years. Regulating authorities are looking for new mechanisms to assure the safety of petroleum installations. Therefore, the use of HAZOP studies to identify offshore risks may continue to increase in the industry as a response to safety requirements.The efficient coordination of the companies involved in the process and the companies' commitment to safety practices may reduce risks during interventions. The subsea industry is increasing its work in deep water regions, and the challenges to achieve production in reservoirs located in extreme conditions are also increasing.

When designing transport facilities for Sakhalin, specific features should be taken into account, namely, difficult climatic conditions, the peculiarity of the economic and geographical position (Russia's only region on the islands, proximity of Japan and other rapidly developing Asia-Pacific region), the current structure of the economy, the uniqueness of the resource potential (biological and hydrocarbon resources of the shelf are of regional and national importance), economic and social development, integrated development and development the non-raw material base of the Far East, industrial development of the regions, major logistic schemes and the prospect of total cargo turnover (The Eurasian Land Bridge) and the potential for the development of the tourism industry. This could change the economic picture of Sakhalin and contribute a big share in the economy of Russian. The rich natural, cultural and historical potential of Sakhalin Island has not yet been fully utilized in the development of international and intraregional tourism. The use of innovative technologies to solve engineering problems will be focused on the requirements for modern artificial structures: reliability and durability, safety and efficiency throughout the life cycle. The choice of the best option, taking into account the alternatives tunnel-bridge will be carried out on the technical and economic indicators of total, construction and operating costs, including the payback period, the cost of emergency situations, seismic and environmental safety.",,,,,4th International Scientific Conference on Transportation Soil Engineering in Cold Regions (TRANSOILCOLD)4th International Scientific Conference on Transportation Soil Engineering in Cold Regions (TRANSOILCOLD),"MAY 20-23, 2019MAY 20-23, 2019","Emperor Alexander I St Petersburg State Transport Univ; Permafrost Young Researchers Network; Russian Univ Transport; Siberian Transport Univ; Far Eastern State Transport Univ; Transportation Res Board; Int Geosynthet Soc, Russian ChapterEmperor Alexander I St Petersburg State Transport Univ; Permafrost Young Researchers Network; Russian Univ Transport; Siberian Transport Univ; Far Eastern State Transport Univ; Transportation Res Board; Int Geosynthet Soc, Russian Chapter","St Petersburg, RUSSIASt Petersburg, RUSSIA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2366-2557,2366-2565,978-981-15-0450-1; 978-981-15-0449-5,,,,,,,,,"Emperor Alexander I St Petersburg State Transport, Dept Bridges & Tunnels & Subways, 9 Moskovsky Pr, St Petersburg 190031, Russia",,,,2021-06-16,WOS:000654263600026,,

The estimated peak and average load per day for the resort are 1185 kW and 13,048 kW respectively. The best optimized stand-alone hybrid energy system comprises of PV, wind, diesel generator, converter and battery. The optimized system resulted in net present cost (NPC) of $17.15 million, cost of energy (COE) of $0.279/kWh, renewable fraction (RF) of 41.6%, and CO2 of 2,571,131 kg/year. Whereas, the diesel only system takes NPC of $21.09 million, COE of $0.343/kWh and CO2 of 5,432,244 kg/year. The diesel only system has higher NPC, COE and CO2 emission than optimized HRES.

SPM concentrations are largely determined by patterns of sediment resuspension from the seabed due to shear stress caused by waves and currents. Hence planning for the construction of large scale offshore structures which will alter regional hydrodynamics needs to consider the consequences for SPM concentrations. Here we develop a one-dimensional (vertical) model of SPM dynamics which can be used to scope the effects of changes in wave and tidal current properties at a site. We implement the model for a number of sites off the east coast of Scotland where we have extensive data sets to enable numerical parameter optimisation. The model performs well at simulating fluctuations in turbidity varying from flood-ebb tidal cycles, spring-neap cycles, storm wave events, and an annual cycle of SPM concentration which is attributed to seasonal consolidation of seabed sediments. Sensitivity analysis shows that, for the range of seabed sediment types in the study (water depth 16-50 m; mud content 0.006-0.380 proportion by weight), relatively large (50%) attenuations of tidal current speed are required to produce changes in water column turbidity which would be detectable by observations given the variability in measurements. The model has potential for application to map the large scale sensitivity of turbidity distributions to the installation of wave and tidal energy extraction arrays. (C) 2016 The Authors.

All benthic stages are nocturnally active and shelter during the day when residing in structured environments, presumably to avoid predation. Recent concerns about habitat destruction and/or degradation through anthropogenic and natural occurrences, as well as previous interest in enhancement of local populations for exploitation purposes, has led to the investigation of providing additional sheltering opportunities for lobsters in shelter-limited habitats. Although various man-made structures (e.g., ship wrecks, sunken aircraft) are known to attract adult lobsters, modern development of artificial reefs currently focuses on imitating natural shelters (particularly those in hard substrates) and are designed according to the spatial preferences of a given species and its ontogenetic phases.A review of five decades of literature indicates an increase in the number of studies on artificial reefs for lobsters stemming from improved knowledge about recruitment processes of important commercial species, as well as remediation attempts due to the decline of many commercial populations from overfishing, disease, man-made environmental disasters, and other natural causes. Collectors developed for postlarvae of several species of spiny and clawed lobsters have been very successful in recruiting this life history stage for a variety of uses, including substitution for loss of natural sheltering habitat, to project future subadult or adult populations, or for future enhancement efforts.Literature on artificial reefs is dominated by the considerable efforts associated with the construction of casitas and pesqueros used for fisheries of the spiny lobster, Palinurus argus, in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, and construction of concrete structures for spiny lobster enhancement in Japanese fisheries. However, due to successes in spiny lobster enhancement, new efforts have focused on artificial reefs for Homarus and Scyllarides spp. Even so, while local density of lobsters may increase at such reefs, there is insufficient evidence that speaks to their effectiveness of increasing population levels of the target species.",,,,,9th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Related Aquatic Habitats (CARAH)9th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Related Aquatic Habitats (CARAH),"NOV 08-13, 2009NOV 08-13, 2009",,"Curitiba, BRAZILCuritiba, BRAZIL",9,0,0,0,9,0,10,,,2154-7769,,978-1-4398-2008-7; 978-1-4398-2007-0,,,,,,,,,"Univ Haifa, Leon Recanati Inst Maritime Studies, IL-31999 Haifa, IsraelUniv Haifa, Dept Maritime Civilizat, Leon H Charney Sch Marine Sci, IL-31999 Haifa, IsraelBoston Univ, Coll Gen Studies, Div Nat Sci & Math, Boston, MA 02215 USA",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000356919700006,,

Artificial structures are becoming increasingly important in conserving biodiversity in urban ecosystems, by providing habitat for endangered or rare species. Their role in providing habitat for such species has, however, been largely unexplored.2. In Sydney Harbour, Australia, seahorses were observed among the netting used to keep sharks Out of swimming enclosures. Over a 2-year period, the relative densities of two species of seahorses observed on netting was measured at swimming enclosures with permanent netting and at swimming areas that were only enclosed with netting during the summer months.3. The rate of colonization by seahorses to new netting was also examined over a period of 10 months.4. Numbers of seahorses on permanent swimming enclosures were 10 to 100 times greater than numbers present on swimming enclosures that were only set up during the summer months.5. This large difference may have been attributed to the slow rate of colonization of seahorses to new habitat. Seahorses were not observed at experimental nets that were deployed in two areas in the harbour until at least 4 months after the netting was deployed.6. Swimming pool nets are a habitat for species of seahorses in Sydney Harbour and, consequently, the removal or disturbance of swimming nets may impact the survival of these fish. Management of these artificial habitats may therefore best be focused on providing a permanent habitat that may help to compensate for the loss of netting during winter months.

However, the attenuation of light is significantly more pronounced in water than in air or in space, and so in order to obtain underwater images in color, it is typically necessary to be within 2 to 3m of the seafloor. In addition to the high risk of collision when operating underwater vehicles at such low altitudes, the limited area of the seafloor covered in each image means large area surveys require a huge investment of time. In this research, we aim to increase the efficiency of mapping large areas of the seafloor by developing an underwater imaging system that can take color images at ranges of up to 13 m, so that each image can cover a larger area, together with the necessary algorithms to automatically process the data it obtains. The system was deployed to map artificial hydrothermal vents in Iheya North Knoll using the ROV Hyper-Dolphin in October 2012.

Caprellids are widely distributed globally and are an important secondary trophic link in many marine ecosystems. They form an important natural dietary component in a variety of coastal marine finfish and appear to contain relatively high levels of beneficial polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 22:6n-3 and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 20:5n-3, although their overall nutritional value is poorly known. Relatively sedentary, caprellids are common members of epibiotic communities on a variety of natural substrata. They readily colonize artificial structures, and under appropriate conditions can attain high biomass, particularly in environments with a higher organic loading, such as around fish farms. Caprellids can exhibit fast growth with relatively quick time to reproductive maturity, short interbrood periods and release of juveniles at parturition. They are opportunistic feeders capable of using a variety of feeding techniques, and environmental tolerances in some species can be quite broad. There is a paucity of information available on culture techniques for caprellids, with most accounts relating to small-scale experimental or laboratory culture, although many of these do indicate the potential suitability of caprellids to larger scale culture. Overall, these characteristics indicate that caprellids are worthy of consideration for application in marine finfish aquaculture. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to the extensive development of wind power on land, currently several European countries have offshore wind farms (OWFs) in operation, as well as proposals to build many more. Considering that seabirds spend more than 90% of their life at sea, it is clear that they may interact with these man-made structures. To date, information on how to measure the impact of OWFs on seabirds is very scarce. In many cases it comes from non-peer reviewed reports made for specific assessment studies, very often carried out without appropriate standard methodologies, that raise questions regarding the level of confidence that they merit. In this paper, we describe the current political framework concerning the possible development of OWFs in Spain. Based on this, we comment on both the relevant variables necessary to assess the impacts of OWFs on birds and the methodologies available to collect those variables in the field, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each method. We show the importance of collision risk models, vulnerability indexes, cumulative impact assessment and population viability analysis as management tools. Mitigation measures that have the potential to minimise impacts are also summarised.

The effect of temperature, exposure time or the presence of micro-organisms are the focus of many studies, for example, however, the effect of the different ions present in seawater remains largely unexplored. The chemical composition of the water changes considerably depending on the location; industrial, glacial, estuarine, and so forth. In addition, when thermal spray aluminum (TSA) protects steel in seawater, calcareous matter precipitates as a result of the cathodic polarization and subsequent localized increase in pH. Therefore, understanding how ions such as magnesium (II), calcium (II), or carbonates alter the coating properties in the marine environment is important.

With the surge in offshore wind developments in sub-arctic regions this problem has received increased attention over the last decade, whereas traditionally the topic has been mainly associated with lighthouses and structures for hydrocarbon extraction. It is important for the safe design of these offshore structures to have the ability to predict the interaction between ice and structure in an expected scenario. A model for simulation of the interaction between a drifting ice floe and a vertically sided offshore structure is presented. The nonlinear speed dependent ductile and brittle deformation and local crushing of ice are considered phenomenologically. A one-dimensional sea ice dynamics model is applied to incorporate the effects of floe size, wind and current. The structure is modelled by incorporating its modal properties obtained from a general-purpose finite element software package. Alternatively, the model can be coupled to in-house design software for fully coupled simulations. Examples of application of the model to simulate dynamic ice-structure interaction are provided. Simulation results are validated with public data from forced vibration experiments, small-scale intermittent crushing and frequency lock-in, and full-scale interaction with the Norstromsgrund lighthouse. Effects of floe size and environmental driving forces on the development of ice-induced vibrations in full-scale are studied. It is shown that sustained frequency lock-in vibrations of the structure can only develop for very specific combinations of environmental driving forces and ice floe size. In all other cases, the ice floe slows down and comes to a stop, or accelerates to a drift speed which exceeds the range where frequency lock-in develops. This results in only a few cycles of vibration per interaction event, such as observed for the Norstromsgrund lighthouse in the Baltic Sea.",,,,,,,,,30,4,0,0,2,0,34,,,0951-8339,1873-4170,,,,,,,,,,"Delft Univ Technol, Dept Hydraul Engn, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, NetherlandsNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Sustainable Arctic Marine & Coastal Technol, Hogskoleringen 7A, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2019-04-18,WOS:000463299800016,,

Furthermore the structural integrity is mainly governed by the fatigue resistance of critical welded details. In a FPSO installation these details are among others pallet stools weld joints to deck structure and bulkheads/web frames weld connections to longitudinal in ballast tanks. ultrasonic peening can improve the fatigue resistance of welded joints. Fatigue test results shows an increase of four times for high stress ranges and up to ten times for high cycle fatigue. For specimens which have already consumed half of their fatigue life the treatment resets the clock to zero, as a minimum value. Consequently ultrasonic peening treatment was applied to several offshore installations on fatigue sensitive weld connections with the objective to extend the service life of the these. Finite Element Analysis carried out by classification societies for these offshore structures demonstrated critical fatigue lives for several weld connections. These weld connections were then treated by ultrasonic peening with the objective to extend their fatigue lives and by doing that reach the targeted service life for the installation. The successful application of the ultrasonic peening treatment was a pioneering work which involved several partners.A pilot project on a FPSO started in 2005 and the treated critical weld connections are still intact and show not sign of crack initiation despite the fact the calculations then showed shorter fatigue lives than the life span already consumed. As a result the same ultrasonic peening procedure has been proposed to be applied for other fatigue sensitive locations on the installation.Offshore installations around the world are reaching their original design life. Most of the operators chose to extend the service life of their assets rather than scrape them and build new. The reasons for that are: improved oil recovering techniques, time required to get a new build installation on site, environment concerns, wiser management of energy and resources among others.

In order to accelerate the deployment of these clean energy assets, costs need to come down. This requires, a good understanding of the different operations along with a robust planning, maintenance and monitoring strategy. Asset management tools have been developed, which require reliability inputs, able to estimate the lifetime operational expenditure (OPEX) and optimize the maintenance strategies for the assets. The lack of large datasets with offshore wind failure rate data in the literature increases the uncertainty in the estimations made by those tools. This paper aims to compare whether the publicly available data could provide an accurate information of the lifetime reliability predictions of the assets. It initially uses a generic average failure rate, taken from literature to model the wind farm; as most wind farm developers will not have any detailed understanding of the reliability of the asset prior to construction. It then uses a more detailed, turbine-specilic model, taking into account reliability data from an operational wind farm. Results show a small overall difference when the model uses the data-informed parameters, by up to 0.4% in the overall availability. Moreover, it is shown that the use of generic values can create more pessimistic results compared to the data-informed data.

First, a series of experimental studies on chloride transport were carried out. Then, an experimentally validated model was developed to further understand the fundamental reactive-transport behaviour of chlorides in concrete in relation to different aggregate surface coating methods. The experimental results show that aggregate surface coating using silica fume can significantly reduce the porosity of interfacial transition zone (e.g. more than 40% reduction of porosity 5 mu m from aggregate surface). Most importantly, the numerical predictions indicate that the slag and silica fume coating could potentially prolong the initiation time of the steel bar corrosion in offshore structures by more than 60% and 170%, respectively.

This is true for the natural environment such as wind, waves, and earthquakes, which are the driving mechanism behind the loadings on a wide variety of land-based and offshore structures. From a design perspective it is important to determine the expected highest value of a stochastic process, and structural fatigue life. The relevant procedures are reasonably well established for processes that have narrow band spectra, but it is much less clear how to deal with non-narrow band cases. In this paper it is shown that the extremes of a Gaussian, non-narrow band process are asymptotically equal to the extremes calculated according to the narrow band formula. Also demonstrated is that fatigue estimates may, with good accuracy, be based on the narrow band formula unless the bandwidth becomes extremely large. These statements are illustrated by examples of a process with (1) a low pass box spectrum, and (2) a Pierson-Moskowitz wave amplitude spectrum. It is also shown that the bandwidth parameter may in some cases be counter-intuitive, as the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum has a larger bandwidth parameter than the box spectrum, even when both cover the same frequency range.

Large-volume cultured bass were reared in lower densities compared to intensively cultured ones and, when fry were about 90 days old, were transferred into external ponds connected to the channels of the surrounding marsh, where that they could integrate pellet food sources with live prey. Intensively cultured bass were fed for 55 days with Artemia salina (Linnaeus, 1758) and then with pellets. Underwater visual census (UVC) and fishing sampling were carried out to verify the presence of the tagged specimens at the artificial reef. A low mortality rate after tagging was observed and good tag retention was recorded. Individuals dead after tagging were statistically smaller than survivors. A total of 45 tagged bass (42 large-volume and 3 intensively cultured) were returned by fishers and 16 specimens were observed during UVC (15 large-volume and 1 intensively cultured). The majority of recaptured bass concentrated in the surroundings of river mouths and harbours suggesting that, after release, sea bass migrated towards shallower and brackish waters. Subsequently, as they grew, they came back towards deeper waters and tended to aggregate around artificial structures. Analysis of stomach contents of returned individuals confirmed their dependence on hard-substrate food items. The study provides evidence to support the suitability of large-volume juveniles for restocking purposes, due to their ability to prey on wild food and their endurance to the stress caused by release operations.

Biofilm formation onto surfaces is usually detrimental to human health and man-made structures; biofilm-related problems range from antibiotic-resistant infections in humans and animals to drinking water contamination, energy loss in industrial systems, and increased corrosion in ship hulls and offshore structures. Biofilms also play several beneficial roles, such as nutrient transformation in the plant rhizosphere and enhanced biodegradation of organic carbon and various pollutants during wastewater treatment and soil bioremediation. Recently, biofilms have shown great potential in selective, low-cost catalysis and energy conversion processes in biofuel production and microbially driven batteries. The biofilm structure provides several advantages to microorganisms within the biofilm, including resistance to biocides and antibiotics, viscoelasticity, and resistance against fluid-dynamic shear stress. The congregation of multiple species into biofilm microcosms increases the range of substrates that can be biodegraded and offers great flexibility for a number of biotechnological applications. In the last 20 years, researchers have unveiled the relationship between biofilm structure and activity and have devised many methods to control biofilm development. However, use of biofilms for contaminant degradation in the field is still in its infancy. Furthermore, the processes that employ biofilms for energy conversion, environmental sensing, and white biotechnology (commonly known as industrial biotechnology) are still largely confined to academic research. In this chapter, we aim to highlight the most important and recent advances in the field of biofilm-basecl technologies and their potential applications.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,978-1-4419-7930-8,,,,,,,,,"Dublin City Univ, Sch Biotechnol, Dublin 9, IrelandNatl Inst Oceanog, Marine Corros & Mat Res Div, Goa, India",,,,2011-07-08,WOS:000287674400003,,

The fish family Syngnathidae (seahorses, pipe. sh, pipehorses and seadragons) is fully protected in New South Wales, Australia, but in some countries certain species are threatened by unsustainable collecting, capture as incidental bycatch, and habitat degradation.2. Within Sydney Harbour, two species of seahorses (Hippocampus abdominalis and Hippocampus whitei) have been found to colonize artificial structures such as jetty pylons and protective netted swimming enclosures. These protective nets are subject to fouling from epibiotic growth (algae, ascidians, bryozoans, etc.) and rubbish, which causes the nets to collapse from the additional weight. Local authorities employ diving contractors on an ad hoc basis to remove the epibiota from nets.3. Surveys showed a significant decline in the numbers of both seahorse species at one site following the replacement of a net, and recovery of the H. whitei population took more than 15 months.4. A manipulative experiment tested the importance of epibiotic growth for seahorses. H. whitei, tagged with individual marks, were allocated to sections of a net that had undergone different cleaning procedures. Seahorse size, position on the net and total population abundance were recorded every 2 weeks over a 3 month period. It was demonstrated that seahorses have a signi. cant positive association with epibiotic growth and proximity to the sea floor. Seahorse populations also showed seasonal variation in abundance with increased numbers on the net during the breeding season (spring-summer).5. This project has led to the development of best practice net cleaning procedures for local authorities in Sydney Harbour to manage growth on the nets while minimizing impacts on seahorse populations.

Especially in marine areas dominated by soft sediments, wind farms may lead to a significant increase in biomass by enlarging habitats from benthos layers into the pelagic column. A concomitant effect is the increase in oxygen consumption through respiration of living biomass and especially through degradation of dead biomass, mainly Mytilus edulis. This leads to impacts on the regional oxygen budget, and local anoxia in the direct vicinity of wind farm piles has been documented in scientific literature. The present study investigates the regional impact of multiple wind farms on oxygen concentration levels and on the appearance of hypoxia. A five-year data sampling with a steel cylinder and fouling plates delivered data for a 3D ecosystem model. The results show that wind farms do not lead to a significant decrease in oxygen on the mesoscale level. But additional anoxia may occur locally, which may lead to the release of hydrogen sulfide on microscale level and potential subsequent regional impacts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The hysteresis loop simulates various important features, such as the soil-pile nonlinearity, the soil degradation, and the soil-pile gap formation. The developed hysteresis loop is consisted of the elastoplastic and drag-gap components, which the elastoplastic component simulates the nonlinear characteristics of soil-pile system and the gap-drag component considers the repeated separation and closure effects of the soil-pile interface.

The actual stress history of structures in operation is an important parameter for the remaining fatigue lifetime. Unfortunately, the fatigue critical locations are often difficult to reach for inspection of cracks or installation of sensors and these direct locations lead to corruption of sensors due to the environmental effects. Virtual sensing enables full-field stress/strain estimation that facilitates fatigue analyses of offshore structures in operation. In the literature, various virtual sensing methods exist but this paper focuses on modal expansion. This technique uses the mode shapes (the linear subspace) of the structure to transform the measured system response into the full-field stress/strain response. The applied mode shapes either hail from a finite element model or an expansion of experimental mode shapes from an operational modal analysis. This paper compares the use of mode shapes from a finite element model to the use of expanded experimental mode shapes. Modal expansion is applied to a scaled offshore platform in the laboratory to estimate the strain response using the finite element mode shapes and expanded experimental mode shapes using different expansion techniques: System Equivalent Reduction Expansion Process (SEREP), local correspondence principle, and the new leave-p-out cross validation implementation of the local correspondence principle introduced in this paper. The results are analysed with different metrics and this paper introduces a new quality measurement - the normalised error of fatigue damage - for strain estimation intended for fatigue analysis. Based on this study, expansion of experimental mode shapes has the potential to reduce errors in stress/strain estimation. The expansion is, however, a fitting process and, thus, it contains fitting error dependent on the case. In this study, the finite element mode shapes outperform some of the mode shape expansion techniques due to this fitting errors. Therefore, expansion of experimental mode shapes can improve stress/strain estimation but it should be used with care to avoid an overfit.",,,,,,,,,35,1,0,0,0,0,37,,,0142-1123,1879-3452,,,,,,,,,,"Aarhus Univ, Dept Engn, Inge Lehmann Gade 10, Aarhus, DenmarkTech Univ Denmark, Dept Civil Engn, Brovej B118, Lyngby, Denmark",,,,2019-11-04,WOS:000491639300031,,

The controversy over offshore wind farms highlights three core issues of conflict: the adequacy of stakeholder consultation processes; the right to compensation for loss of livelihood; and the lack of adequate data. We find that the characterisations that developers, regulators, and fishers hold of each other critically inform their positions on these issues. We examine the weak bargaining position of fishers, and the 'power game' that is played out between them and developers. We conclude that offshore wind farm development would be better managed if stakeholder consultation was more extensive, compensation claims were standardised, and scientific data were more readily available, but that in the meantime, fishers could improve their bargaining power by mobilising potential allies.",,,,,,,,,74,0,0,0,11,0,77,,,2155-0085,2155-0093,,,,,,,,,,"Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, EnglandNewcastle Univ, Sch Architecture Planning & Landscape, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000212061500001,,

As predicted, the results suggested that both pilings and pontoons, particularly the latter, create novel habitats for epibiotic assemblages independent of age and composition of substratum. It is not fully understood why these urban structures act as such different habitats from natural rocky reefs.

However, they are equally susceptible to environmental degradation, especially due to pitting corrosion in highly corrosive marine environments. Pitting immersion tests performed on 304 austenitic stainless steel specimens using ASTM G48 presented significant challenges. Some of the issues encountered during these tests included unspecified experimental factors that control the pitting process such as pH, specimen size limitations, materials' properties, and the variation on the quality of the test solution. To overcome these challenges, the effect of surface finishes and aeration of the test solution on the corrosion behavior of 304 stainless steel specimens in 6% ferric chloride were examined and compared. The result shows that an aerated solution has much lower concentrations of pits compared to quiescent solutions. Controlled aeration eliminates unwanted crevice corrosion background noise. Subsequently, to suit larger specimens, the ASTM G48 was modified. This study presents the modified ASTM G48 procedure. A series of pitting corrosion tests on stainless steel specimen with different thickness were conducted and data were statistically evaluated. The generalized extreme value distribution, such as Weibull, provides adequate statistical descriptions of the pit depth and pit diameter distributions. The modified ASTM G48 offered advantages in the extraction and interpretation of the data for pit characteristics in the accelerated pitting corrosion test simulating actual marine environment.

This represents the more usual 'passive' approach to ecoengineering where features are built to enhance biodiversity and are allowed to colonise naturally, as opposed to seeding or transplanting organisms to features. While flowerpots supported some mobile species not found on the seawall, other species common on natural shores did not recruit to flowerpots. Thus, in a second experiment we tested the effectiveness of an 'active' approach through transplanting mobile organisms to flowerpots to expedite the colonisation process. For the species examined, however, most individuals did not stay in the flowerpots for more than 24 h after being transplanted.

This paper introduces a proactive framework that identifies and considers all the initial relevant risks. Compared to the conventional approaches that rely on precursor data for accident modelling, the developed methodology utilizes the critical stochastic variables directly from the hydrodynamic analysis of the floating structure. For this purpose, a novel numerical model is proposed to replicate a storm based on Endurance Wave Analysis (EWA) method. This approach reduces the computational cost (time and load) of the simulations. The critical stochastic variables are subsequently used in Bayesian Network (BN) to develop the risk model.

Federal statutes and legislation, including the National Environmental Policy Act, Federal Energy Act of 2005, the Endangered Species Act, and the Migratory Bird Treaty will require that prospective developers conduct some form of avian risk assessment prior to construction. Such preconstruction studies should utilize a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design.Offshore wind farms pose three primary threats to birds: barrier effects due to flight avoidance, habitat loss (due to displacement), and fatalities resulting from collisions with turbine blades. All have been demonstrated at land-based and coastal wind farms, and flight avoidance and shifts in habitat use have been demonstrated in the offshore environment for a limited number of species in Europe. The additive effect of these impacts to bird populations may be trivial under current levels of development, but could become ecologically significant as offshore installations increase as projected.Interpreting the ecological significance of these effects requires additional research, especially on understanding the importance of winter foraging habitat and population delineation, particularly for waterfowl.

They necessarily involve on-board energy storage because grid-connection would be prohibitively expensive. Hydrogen is one of the most promising solutions. However, it is well-known that it is challenging to store and transport hydrogen which may have a critical impact on the delivered hydrogen cost.In this paper, it is shown that there are vast areas far offshore where wind power is both characterized by high winds and limited seasonal variations. Capturing a fraction of this energy could provide enough energy to cover the forecast global energy demand for 2050. Thus, scenarios are proposed for the exploitation of this resource by fleets of hydrogen producing wind energy converters sailing autonomously. The scenarios include transportation and distribution of the produced hydrogen.The delivered hydrogen cost is estimated for the various scenarios in the short term and in the longer term. Cost estimates are derived using technical and economic data available in the literature and assumptions for the cost of electricity available on-board the wind energy converters. In the shorter term, delivered cost estimates are in the range 7.1-9.4 (sic)/kg depending on the scenario and the delivery distance. They are based on the assumption of on-board electricity cost at 0.08(sic)/kWh. In the longer term, assuming an on-board electricity cost at 0.04(sic).kWh, the cost estimates could reduce to 3.5 to 5.7 (sic)/kg which would make the hydrogen competitive on several hydrogen markets without any support mechanism. For the hydrogen to be competitive on all hydrogen markets including the ones with the highest GHG emissions, a carbon tax of approximately 200 (sic)/kg would be required.

In the present study, the fish assemblage established around the oil jetties of Eilat (northern Red Sea, Israel) was compared to those found in three adjacent natural reef habitats: two in a nature reserve (one shallow and one deep) and a third deep site located near the city. Both species richness and fish abundance were found to be significantly higher around the vertical structures of the jetty's pillars than at all three natural sites, with the lowest values at the site closest to the city. The higher species richness at the jetties may be explained by (1) the vertical relief and high complexity of the jetty which offers a variety of niches for both shallow and deep coral reef species, and (2) by the reduction in available niches at the natural sites as a result of coral destruction due to anthropogenic activity. The pronounced difference in fish abundance is attributed mainly to the high seasonal recruitment at the jetty which was much lower at the natural sites. We therefore suggest that vertical structures are more attractive to fish settlement and recruitment than moderately sloped bottoms such as those found at the fringing reefs of Eilat. High similarity (51 to 56%) was found between fish assemblages at the natural sites while relatively low similarity (27 to 37%) was found between the jetty and the natural reefs. The jetty's complex vertical artificial structures can serve as a model for future construction of artificial reefs designed to restore the fish community in areas where the natural reefs have been damaged.

Importantly, while scenes containing 'Trees' tend to rate highly, places containing more bland natural green features such as 'Grass' and 'Athletic Fields' are considered less scenic. We also find that a neural network can be trained to automatically identify scenic places, and that this network highlights both natural and built locations.

Results from the resampling tests indicated that whales were distributed farther from the drilling rig than they would be under a random scenario. Results from the Mantel tests indicated that in 1993, the spatial pattern of bowhead whale distribution was highly correlated with distance from the drilling rig, indicating that the presence of the drilling rig resulted in a significant temporary loss in available habitat.

Human modifications of marine habitats include the introduction of boating infrastructure, coastal defences and offshore energy installations that are occurring at an increasing rate. These artificial structures are now widely recognised as providing opportunities for the establishment and dispersal of non-indigenous fouling species in new regions. This is driving increased interest into how structures might be designed and built to limit their suitability for invasive species. At the same time the potential for artificial habitats to provide habitat to native and threatened species means that the control of NIS on these structures should not just rely on antifouling. Green or eco-engineering aims to incorporate ecological theory and principles into the design of engineered structures. When combined with other management strategies that aim to increase the resistance of recipient environments there is the potential to enhance practical barriers against invaders in an increasingly developed ocean. Here I explore examples of NIS facilitation by artificial structures and the ecological theories that could be used to reduce opportunities for NIS establishment and spread. Examples include (1) manipulating the physical and chemical properties of structures to enhance native recruitment over NIS, (2) enhancing resource use of structures by native species through pre-seeding, (3) providing opportunities for native grazers and predators to easily access structures, and (4) considering the timing of construction/maintenance/decommissioning for artificial structures such that resources are not made available when propagule pressure is also high.

The foundations of these kinds of structures do not resist lateral environmental loads forces; instead, restoring moments are provided by a large buoyancy force, a set of guylines or a combination of both. These structures have a fundamental frequency well below the ocean wave's lower frequency bound. As a result of the relatively large displacements, geometric nonlinearity is an important consideration in the analysis of such a structure. This paper presents a literature review on offshore compliant structures. Our purpose for this paper was to primarily explore the various modeling approaches used by workers worldwide to better understand the behavior of such structures. The review focuses on the static and dynamic response of the structure due to various environmental conditions, such as wind, waves, and current. Emphasis is placed on modeling techniques and methods of solution. Many modeling and analysis techniques are common to the aerospace and ocean engineering communities due to the similarities in structural and environmental complexities. For example, aerodynamic loads on offshore platforms are a significant part of any analysis. Also, fluid loading models bear great similarities to mechanistic wind loading models. It is in this vein that a review paper with the focus offshore structures is included in a journal of aerospace engineering.",,,,,,,,,42,6,0,0,0,1,49,,,0893-1321,,,,,,,,,,,"RAFAEL,IL-31021 HAIFA,ISRAEL",,,,1996-10-01,WOS:A1996VK56300003,,

Multi-resolution Landsat satellite imagery were used for shoreline change study from 1972 to 2010. During this period, accretion was recorded updrift of artificial structures, viz, seawall, groin, pylons and jetties; while, extensive erosion was recorded in downdrift areas of these structures. Assessment was subsequently divided into four categories ranging from high erosion to accretion. Data from several sources were compiled to map landuse and human activities in the coastal zone. This map was divided into four categories, ranging from very high capital to no capital landuse. Population density map of the surrounding coastal villages was generated using census data, and divided into four categories ranging from high density area to very low density area. Subsequently, coastal erosion vulnerability was assessed by combining coastal retreat with landuse type and population density in this study area using simple vector algebraic technique. Zones of vulnerability of different magnitude (viz., very high, high, moderate, and low) have been identified. Furthermore, calculation of imminent collapse zone (ICZ) shows that maximum values are around artificial structures and anthropogenic activities.

Inevitable design modifications and material changes have also resulted in inefficient pipe installation works. In this study, an algorithm is proposed to systematically determine the pipe installation sequence. An accurate and fast algorithm to identify the geometric relationship of piping materials is presented. To improve the calculation efficiency, the interference is gradually examined from simplified to complicated shapes. It is demonstrated that the calculation efficiency is significantly improved with successive geometric operations such as back-face culling and use of bounding boxes. After the final installation sequence is determined, the entire installation process is visualized in a virtual reality environment so that the process can be rendered and understood for a full-scale model.

In order to test the usefulness of artificial holdfast units (AHU) to enhance habitat recovery, several of these structures were deployed at four different locations with distinct environmental characteristics and surveyed for seahorse abundance during a 6 month period. All AHU were colonized by seahorses within a month after deployment, reaching a maximum density of 13.1 seahorse M-2 at one of the sites. Results suggest that these AHU have the potential to aggregate seahorses in damaged habitats but have limited effect when placed close to natural high complexity habitats. The results from this experiment provide useful guidance in the use of artificial structures to improve degraded seahorse habitats in other similar situations, as part of management plans for seahorse population recovery.

Like many offshore structures, SCRs are subjected to gross cyclic movements during operation, which remould the seabed soil. The fatigue life of these structures is highly sensitive to the stiffness and strength of the seabed response. Accurate modelling of this behaviour requires a framework that can capture the changes in soil strength and stiffness that occur throughout the design life, accounting for remoulding during extreme events, and reconsolidation during the intervening periods. This paper describes such a framework, which is couched in effective stress terms. Soil softening during remoulding is predominantly associated with excess pore pressure generation, and the subsequent regain in strength is linked to the dissipation of excess pore pressure. The framework can describe the variation of resistance on a cylinder (i.e. a pipe) during any sequence of vertical cyclic motion, interspersed with pause periods. The framework is based on a critical state approach, with the current strength being linked to the current moisture content. The framework is shown to capture well the load-penetration response during an episodic T-bar penetrometer test. The operative soil strength is shown to vary dramatically throughout this event, with the softening effect of remoulding being almost entirely negated by a regain in strength associated with periods of partial or complete reconsolidation. The framework provides a basis for capturing these dramatic effects to aid pipeline and riser design (and other processes that involve gross remoulding and reconsolidation), without recourse to a full numerical simulation of the entire soil domain.",,,,,,,,,37,1,0,0,0,0,37,,,0016-8505,1751-7656,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, Ctr Offshore Fdn Syst, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",,,,2013-02-08,WOS:000313210800003,,

To this end, the conventional Monte Carlo simulation technique (CTS) is frequently used for predicting the probability distribution of the extreme values of response.

Using data from two colonies where food is not considered limiting, we present a comparative study on nest survival in Bank Cormorants. Using a combination of the Mayfield method and parametric survival analysis, nest success was compared in nests on man-made structures at Robben Island, South Africa, where birds breed during the austral winter, with nests on man-made and natural structures at Mercury Island, Namibia, where Bank Cormorants breed during the austral summer. Overall, the probability of a nest surviving the breeding attempt was lower at Robben Island than at Mercury Island in all three seasons. Nest failures at Robben Island were related to wave heights and air temperature, with trends to suggest reduced chick survival in years where major storm events occurred during peak breeding. A heat wave appeared to cause major chick mortality at Mercury Island in 2005. Nest survival was relatively invariable between years at the main site monitored on Mercury Island, where nests were partially sheltered from the sun, but breeding productivity was poor in comparison to other cormorant species. Winter breeding in South Africa may increase the risk from storms but reduce the risk of heat exposure.

Observational studies are needed to improve understanding of faunal assemblages supported by offshore infrastructure and better predict the effect of removal. Here, we present results from visual inspection and physical sampling of a small oil and gas industry structure decommissioned from an oil field in the North East Atlantic. This is supported by observations of similar structures nearby and by photographs of the surrounding seabed from environmental baseline surveys. The structure supported a reasonably high biomass and diversity of invertebrates (10 kg and 39 macrofaunal and 17 megafaunal species) and fishes (20 kg biomass and 4 species). The invertebrate megafaunal species present on the structure were a sub-set of the hard substratum fauna observed on surrounding seabed. Porifera were absent from the structure. Biological succession in the first 2 years occurred as follows. Sparse colonies of the hydroid Obelia sp. stet were early colonisers then subsequent development of thick hydroid turf (Obelia sp. stet. and Halecium sp. stet.) supported an invertebrate assemblage (2654 individuals kg wet mass -1 ) dominated by saddle oysters [Pododesmus squama (Gmelin, 1791) and Heteranomia sp. stet.)] and scale worms (Harmothoe spp.). Percentage cover of hydroid turf varied significantly over the structure, with most growth on sections exposed to strongest currents. Commercially important fish species present around the structure included Gadus morhua (Atlantic cod), Pollachius virens (saithe) and Lophius piscatorius (monkfish). Studies of artificial structures such as this provide much needed data to understand their role in the ecology of seafloor habitats and inform environmental decision making on all stages of industry from exploration to decommissioning. We show that the ecological role of the decommissioned three-dimensional structures was to enhance the biomass of a sub-set of epifaunal invertebrates found in the area. This supported diverse associated macrofaunal organisms, providing a food source for motile invertebrates and fishes in an area where background hard substratum can be lost through the impacts of drilling.

This data will be useful in optimizing the design of future offshore wind turbines thereby helping the U.S. in its quest for renewable energy sources.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,820607,,,,,,,,University of Michigan Ann Arbor,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13874695,,

Unlike coastal installations, offshore wind farms allow for increased availability of wind power and wind persistence, as well as lower visual impact of the turbines. Existing offshore wind farms offer important advantages for aquaculture plans especially in terms of lack of major physical constrains, e.g., navigation routes, submarine cables, marine protected areas. Moreover, enhanced current velocity due to the presence of the piles and to the air fluxes of the turbines may increase the environmental suitability of aquaculture plans in these areas. In addition, the transmission of localized depleted water masses or waste material towards near-shore zones can be avoided, excluding potential impact close to the coast. On the other hand, other environmental constrains (e.g. temperature and salinity variability, dissolved oxygen concentrations, phytoplankton dynamics) need also to be considered when planning aquaculture activities.In this context, the present paper gives a contribution towards the definition of a sustainability index for the large scale localization of marine areas as offshore wind farms and aquaculture plans. This index is developed on the basis of a Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) technique, already used in open water aquaculture localization: raw data were converted to suitability scores, which were combined using additive models, in order to define the overall suitability. A detailed analysis of the environmental suitability is performed for few specific test cases at offshore wind farms located in the Denmark coastal zone, for which some projects of offshore aquaculture plans have been proposed.The use of this sustainability index will perform quantitative evaluations of the degree of compatibility between the offshore wind farms and the open water aquaculture, highlighting the main problems which can rise by the integration of both technologies.",,,,,"2nd International Conference on Physical Coastal Processes, Management and Engineering2nd International Conference on Physical Coastal Processes, Management and Engineering","APR 27-29, 2011APR 27-29, 2011","Univ Las Palmas; Wessex Inst Technol; Univ Parthenope; WIT, Transact Ecol & Environm; ASCE UK GrpUniv Las Palmas; Wessex Inst Technol; Univ Parthenope; WIT, Transact Ecol & Environm; ASCE UK Grp","Naples, ITALYNaples, ITALY",10,0,0,0,2,0,10,,,1743-3541,,978-1-84564-534-2,,,,,,,,,"Univ Parthenope, Dept Appl Sci, Naples, ItalyTech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Lyngby, Denmark",,,,2012-11-07,WOS:000309430200001,,

Polymetallic nodules, manganese crusts, metalliferous sulphidic muds and massive consolidated sulphides might serve as exploitable sources of various metals, whilst phosphorite deposits represent a further resource. The main types of waste targeted for deep-sea disposal are munitions, radioactive wastes, large offshore structures, sewage sludge and dredge spoils. Furthermore, it has recently been proposed to introduce huge quantities of carbon dioxide from industrial processes into the deep ocean in order to mitigate the greenhouse effect. A description of the different mineral resources and waste materials is given, including information on the related technology and the status of the dumping and mining operations, respectively. The predicted effects of waste disposal and mining on the deep-sea environment are reviewed, possible impacts including removal of settling benthic substrate and mechanical stress exerted on soft bottom communities, plus impacts of sediment plumes, toxic materials and degradable organic matter. An overview of the major environmental studies in the deep sea is given. Two categories of study can be discerned, research conducted after environmental impacts (e.g., the monitoring of contamination by sewage sludge disposal off the New York Bight) and precautionary environmental studies on potential impacts threatening the deep sea environment in connection with its future human use (i.e., studies aiming to assess the possible effects of deep-sea mining). The development of large scale in-situ experiments was a new approach to the environmental risk assessment of nodule mining in the deep sea. In the course of the DISCOL project in the south-east Pacific, the first experiment of this kind was implemented and monitored for three years. Another type of large-scale in-situ experimentation in the deep sea is represented by the Benthic Impact Experiments (BIEs) which have been conducted with similar experimental design by a number of nations or multinational consortia. Since environmental impacts deriving from human penetration into the deep sea on an industrial scale are expected to be severe and long-lasting, a precautionary approach in the related environmental research seems most appropriate. It is therefore proposed that environmental risk assessment in the deep sea should rely on in-situ experiments which should start from a simulation of small-scale impacts and proceed stepwise to the monitoring of a full-scale industrial operation. At each stage impacts need to be evaluated thoroughly.",,,,,,,,,39,2,0,0,16,0,42,,,1386-1980,,,,,,,,,,,"Zoologisches Institut und Museum, Universitaet Hamburg, Martin-Luther-King-Platz 3, D-20146, Hamburg, Germany",,,,2000-10-01,BCI:BCI200100045974,,

Almost 2/3 of all hydrocarbon leaks on offshore installations in the period 2001-2005 according to the Risk level project by Petroleum Safety Authority in Norway, resulted from manual operations and interventions, as well as shut-down and start-up, confirming what is considered common knowledge; that incidents and accidents often are caused by failure of operational barriers. Investigations of major near accidents show that technical, human, operational, as well as organizational factors influence the leakages. In spite of these facts, quantitative risk analyses of offshore oil and gas production platforms have focused on technical safety systems. The intention with the Risk OMT (Risk Modelling-Integration of Organisational, Human and Technical factors) program has been to develop more representative models for calculation of leak frequencies as a function of the volume of manual operations and interventions. The Risk OMT program represents a further development of the work in the BORA and OTS projects. The emphasis is on a more comprehensive modeling of Risk Influencing Factors (RIFs) and how these affect the performance of operational barriers. The basic approach is the same, but the intention with the Risk OMT program has been to develop further the models used in BORA and OTS. In the Risk OMT project a generic risk model has been developed and is adapted to use for specific failure scenarios. The model considers the operational barriers in event trees and fault trees, as well as RIFs that determine the basic event probabilities in the fault trees. The generic risk model applies Bayesian belief networks in its modeling. The model has been evaluated through case studies and has been applied to evaluate the effect of different proposed strategies to reduce the leakage rates.

In a marine environment, waves, wind, and earthquakes, often known as cyclic loads, are a main contributor to the loading of the seabed. The safety of offshore structures relies on the response of soft marine clay to these cyclic loadings. Its very fine-grained composition, and hence low permeability, is the defining factor for soft marine clay showing a very different response to cyclic loading than sand. The responses of soft marine clay subjected to cyclic loading range from degradation in soil strength and stiffness to principal stress rotation, excess pore pressure generation, and deformation accumulation. These dynamic characteristics of soft marine clay are strongly influenced by several factors, including loading level (amplitude, frequency, and number of cycles), loading history, and path. The purpose of the present paper is to present an overview of the research results on the characteristics of soft marine clay under cyclic loading in the past decades.

How these artificial structures affect fish populations is largely unknown, and there is ongoing debate regarding their value as surrogate habitats for ecologically and economically important reef fish species. Thus, the purpose of this study was to characterize trends in Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus reproductive potential in the western Gulf at oil and gas platform reefs relative to reproductive potential at natural banks. Red Snapper (n = 1,585) were collected during 2013-2015 from standing platforms, decommissioned platform artificial reefs, and natural banks by using standardized vertical line gear. Comparisons of gonadosomatic index, male : female ratios, batch fecundity, annual fecundity, spawning frequency, and number of spawning-capable individuals indicated that Red Snapper reproductive biology was similar among natural bank, standing platform, and artificial reef habitats. These results suggest that in terms of reproductive output, fish inhabiting artificial reefs are functionally similar to similar-aged fish on natural banks. This work can be used to make informed management decisions and suggests that there are benefits to converting decommissioned platforms into designated artificial reefs. Future studies should consider site-specific characteristics, such as depth, vertical relief, and proximity to other structures, to elucidate how habitat characteristics may influence reproduction, ultimately improving future artificial reef deployments for fisheries enhancement in the western Gulf.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,13,0,18,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Texas Pk & Wildlife Dept Coastal Fisheries, Upper Laguna Madre Ecosyst, Nat Resource Ctr, Suite 2500,6300 Ocean Dr,Unit 5845, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USATexas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr,Unit 5869, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USAFlorida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, 5600 US-1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA",Texas Pk & Wildlife Dept Coastal Fisheries,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000450602900002,,

Even if the structural system can be assumed to be linear, due to nonlinearity of the wave loading mechanism and also due to the intermittency of wave loading on members in the splash zone, the response is often non-Gaussian. The (conventional) method of moments is one of the methods which is frequently used to determine the parameters of the adopted probability model from a simulated or measured record of response. However, when higher order moments (e.g. 3rd or 4th order moments) are required for the derivation of distribution parameters, the parameter values obtained from this method show considerable scatter due to sampling variability. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the efficiency of the conventional form of the method of moments with two alternative forms of the method, i.e. with linear and the (new) low-order methods of moments. As a method of demonstration, the three different methods of moments have been applied to symmetric Pierson-Holmes distributions. The results show that in most cases the sampling variability of the parameter values determined from the two alternative forms of the method of moments is much smaller than their corresponding values derived from the conventional method of moments.

At the state level only Texas has a leasing system for offshore wind. Since all offshore land is the property of the state and cannot be legally developed without a lease from the government, these absences have stalled development. We review and compare regulatory and leasing systems developed in Europe and the US to inform a discussion of the major issues associated with the development of an offshore leasing and regulatory system.

The LES model captures turbulence due to winds, waves, thermal convection, and tides, thereby providing a high degree of physical realism, and bending moments are calculated for an idealized infinitely thin circular rotor disc. Probability density functions of bending moments are calculated and detailed statistical measures of the turbulent environment are also examined, including vertical profiles of Reynolds stresses, two-point velocity correlations, and velocity structure functions. The simulations show that waves and tidal velocity have the largest impacts on the strength of bending moments, while boundary layer stability and wind speeds have only minimal impacts. It is shown that either transverse velocity structure functions or two-point transverse velocity spatial correlations can be used to predict and understand turbulent bending moments in tidal channels.

Such infrastructure operates in a harsh environment. Allowance must be made for structural deterioration since protective measures such as paint coatings, galvanizing or cathodic protection may be ineffective. Reliability analysis requires accurate engineering models for the description and prediction of material corrosion loss and for the maximum depth of pitting. New probability-based models for both these forms of corrosion have been proposed recently and calibrated against a wide range of data. The effects of water velocity and of water pollution are reviewed and compared with recently reported field data for a corrosion at an offshore oil platform. The data interpreted according to the model show good correlation when allowance is made for the season of first immersion and the adverse effects of seawater velocity and of water pollution. An example is given to illustrate the application of reliability analysis to a pipeline subject to pitting corrosion. An important outcome is that good quality estimation of the longer-term probability of loss of structural integrity requires good modelling of the longer-term corrosion behaviour. This is usually associated with anaerobic corrosion. As a result, it cannot be extrapolated from data for short-term corrosion as this is associated with aerobic corrosion conditions.

Therefore, in the present investigation, the current movement was substituted by moving an offshore structure at a prescribed slow speed corresponding to current velocity.

The forced oscillation consisting of tow different harmonic components was realized by making simultaneous use of the towing carriage with the new control apparatus, and an existing planar motion mechanism. As the result, it was found that the inertia force coefficients for two kinds of harmonic motions are fairly equal to each other, and they are exactly the same as the inertia force coefficient obtained by the simple harmonic forced oscillation.In addition, the hydrodynamic characteristics of a permeable offshore structures were investigated by making use of the above-mentioned towing carriage.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,3402040,,,,,,,,University of Tokyo,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14386474,,

Further, recent accidents have highlighted the dangers of conducting practice launches even in calm conditions. This gap in training capability is being addressed by innovative simulation-based training for marine evacuation systems that provides training in extreme conditions, but in a safe environment.",,,,,18th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE 2008)18th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE 2008),"JUL 06-11, 2008JUL 06-11, 2008",Int Soc Offshore & Polar EngineersInt Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers,"Vancouver, CANADAVancouver, CANADA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1098-6189,,978-1-880653-70-8,,,,,,,,,"Mem Univ Newfoundland, Ocean Engn Res Ctr, St John, NF, CanadaVirtual Marine Technol, St John, NF, Canada",Virtual Marine Technol,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000259888200032,,

The relative resistance to foreshore and backshore erosion caused by anthropogenic lake level regulation was compared between these two nearshore configurations. Reflective systems were characterized by dynamic gravel beach faces and steep inshore shelves armored by wave-washed cobble. In contrast, dissipative systems were characterized by sand-sized substratum, broad flat inshore shelves and the presence of multiple linear bars approximately 350 m offshore. Five decades of regulated lake levels have resulted in extensive shoreline erosion (970 ha on the north shore of the lake) and a general reshaping of both types of nearshore environments, although dissipative shorelines eroded faster (5.7 m/year maximum and 2.0 m/year average).

The number of HC leaks on offshore production installations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf peaked just after year 2000, with more than 40 leaks per year with initial rate above 0.1kg/s. The Norwegian Oil and Gas Association carried out a reduction project from 2003 until 2007, which resulted in 10 HC leaks above 0.1kg/s in 2007. The number of leaks increased in the years after 2007 and was on average 15 in the period 2008-2010, without any significant increase in the number of installations. A new initiative was launched early in 2011 in order to reduce the number of HC leaks further. A study performed by the project concludes that more than 50% of the leaks are associated with failure of operational barriers during manual intervention into the process systems. Human and organisational factors are dominating with respect to circumstances and root causes. The study has further demonstrated the high importance of verification as an operational barrier and has shown that many of the failures do not have multiple operational barriers in the form of several verifications and a leak test at the end. This finding is crucial in order to understand the criticality of performing the planned verifications, perform them in an independent manner according to the procedures and make sure that the focus is on detecting failures during the verification.

Here, we describe one analysis of all of the measurements from NDBC buoys in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere in US waters, with a view to placing Hurricane Ivan's waves in the context of other measurements. The largest significant wave heights (SWH's) measured during Hurricane Ivan in the Gulf of Mexico rival the largest waves ever recorded in all US waters. This is noteworthy because, on a return period basis, the Gulf of Mexico has the smallest wave climate compared with all other regions around the US. At four locations in the Gulf of Mexico, the SWH's were the largest ever recorded at those locations, and exceeded the previous biggest waves by a significant margin. Wave-induced velocities are estimated to be as high as 3.5 m/s at some locations, which may have contributed to the extensive mud, sediment, and pipeline movements that have been reported.

In particular, the temporal and spatial patterns of communities in association with artificial substrate are still poorly understood. This study examined possible effects of experimental tetrapod fields on the decapod crustacean community in a subtidal hard-bottom area in the southern North Sea. We performed in situ studies in the fields and along transects oriented away from the tetrapod fields. Species composition and abundances were assessed before and after the introduction of the artificial material. The study revealed a significant decrease of smaller, less vagile species (Pisidia longicornis, Pilumnus hirtellus, Galathea squamifera) over the entire study area in the years following the tetrapod introduction. For 2 species, Hyas araneus and Homarus gammarus, the tetrapods appeared to be highly attractive as habitat and shelter because their abundance increased over time. No distinct spatial or temporal effects were observed for mobile predatory crabs, such as Cancer pagurus and Liocarcinus spp. The results of the study demonstrate that possible effects of artificial structures on macro-invertebrates in temperate hard-bottom areas are highly species-specific and depend on the size, lifestyle and ecological requirements of the species. This work highlights the importance of long-term studies. Our findings clearly indicate that more time is needed to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic influences on species distributions.

Artificial structures can influence the wave regime, hydrodynamic circulation and sediment transport, thus reducing the ability of a shoreline to respond to natural forcing factors (such as the monsoonal regime) which also fragment the coastal space. In the studied area on the Kuala Terengganu coast of Malaysia, a new 1-km airport runway extension was constructed with a tarmac structure jutting out into the sea. This extension structure has a groyne-shaped geometry that has consequently altered the shoreline, hydrodynamics and sediment transport patterns on the adjoining coast. This recently transformed environment is investigated using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) and Mike programs. The objective of this article is to describe the various coastal morphodynamic situations, as well as discuss the sustainable erosion mitigation strategies that are available, by involving local stakeholders within the coastal management system itself. The lessons learnt from previous management failures show that addressing the concerns, views and opinions of local stakeholders is pivotal, and must be taken into consideration by consulting them during the early stages of the planning process and beyond. The study then sets out a proposed solution to the issues at stake, based on a combination of detached breakwaters and beach nourishments within the critically eroded areas. There is indeed a direct need for more coastal defence structures in the studied area due to the ever-increasing coastal erosion, especially in the northern sector. In fact, although a series of revetments/ripraps have been built in the past to protect the beaches from erosion, these artificial structures have proved to be quite ineffective in mitigating the erosion problem at the sites in question.",,,,,,,,,23,1,0,0,9,0,23,,,0964-5691,1873-524X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Sch Marine & Environm Sci, Kuala Terengganu 21030, Terengganu, MalaysiaUniv Bretagne Sud, Ctr Rech Yves Coppens, Geosci Ocean UMR CNRS 6538, Campus Tohann, F-56000 Vannes, FranceUniv Malaysia Terengganu, Inst Oceanog & Environm, Kuala Terengganu 21030, Terengganu, MalaysiaUniv Teknol MARA, Fac Civil Engn, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia",Univ Bretagne Sud,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000444793600045,,

The benefit of employing the large offshore wind farms in this AVC system is investigated. The simulation based on the measurement data from the Danish electricity control center demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of the cost minimization.

The technique is commonly used for protecting metallic structures placed in aggressive environments, e.g. ship hulls, offshore structures and underground pipelines.Mathematical models of CP problems require appropriate boundary conditions given by a polarization curve, which is a non-linear relationship between the electrochemical potential and current density. However, information on the polarization curve is not always available and strongly depends on the time history of the system. Another important problem in corrosion engineering is the identification of coating holidays, i.e. parts of the structure which have lost their protective coating and became anodic and prone to strong localized corrosion.The purpose of this paper is to present a boundary element methodology coupled to genetic algorithms for inverse problems in corrosion engineering. The problems studied include the identification of parameters characterizing the polarization curve, the identification of coating holidays and the optimization of anode positioning and their impressed current.

In general, the strategy of nesting on man-made structures is uncommon both in Ukraine and Europe, and Cormorants do this only in the absence of other sites suitable for nesting. Special research on Cormorant colonies on technogenic constructions was carried out during the field expeditions by the Research Institute of Biodiversity of Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecosystems of Ukraine in 2002-2003 and 2012-2016. Besides this, we used retrospective and current data from the literature and Internet resources. Most of the field work was carried out by making surveys by boat and on foot. As a result, we found 8 Cormorant colonies on technogenic constructions in Ukraine: gas platforms in the Sea of Azov (near the village Strilkove, Henichesk district of Kherson region); sunken ships - targets for bombing training near the Arabat Spit (these are also known as ship islands); electricity pylons of the high-voltage Enerhodar Dnipro Power Line where it crosses the Kakhovka Reservoir; the dock in Yahorlyk Bayk, used in the past as a target for bombing training bombing; artificial island-platforms on Lake Chernine (Kinburn Peninsula); an artificial island on the Sasyk Lagoon (Odessa region); artificial islands, made as navigation markers on the Kremenchuk and Kiev reservoirs. The study found that in most cases the accompanying species was the Caspian Gull (Larus cachinnans Pallas, 1811), which actively destroys the Cormorants' nests and eats their eggs and chicks. The number of nests in the colonies varied greatly (5-30 nests on the navigation marker islands and ca. 2 000-2 300 on the ship-islands and gas platforms). This is due, primarily, to the area of the breeding territory. The research found that fierce territorial competition was observed in most of the colonies both with Caspian Gulls and between Cormorants. In addition, we observed anthropogenic interference in the colonies by fishermen and workers conducting routine maintenance work (as happened in the case of electricity pylons and gas platforms). The benefit of this study is that it is the first research in Ukraine conducted at national level on this type of nesting by Cormorants.

However, as with estuaries worldwide, its diversity and functioning faces increasing threats from urbanisation. This is the first synthesis of threats and impacts in Sydney Harbour. In total 200 studies were reviewed: 109 focussed on contamination, 58 on habitat modification, 11 addressed non-indigenous species (NIS) and eight investigated fisheries. Metal concentrations in sediments and seaweeds are among the highest recorded worldwide and organic contamination can also be high. Contamination is associated with increased abundances of opportunistic species, and changes in benthic community structure. The Harbour is also heavily invaded, but invaders' ecological and economic impacts are poorly quantified. Communities within Sydney Harbour are significantly affected by extensive physical modification, with artificial structures supporting more NIS and lower diversity than their natural equivalents.

J,,,,,,,,,Natalie Ruth Hicks,,Functionality and Ecological Connectivity of Man-Made Structures (FuECoMMS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Aug 11 2020,2020,"With the increasing amount of energy-related infrastructure (oil and gas platforms, wind turbines, cables) installed in the North Sea, there is a need to understand the role these man-made structures (MMS) play in the marine ecosystem. Current decommissioning regulations prohibit leaving installations in place in any form, which means complete removal when no longer in production. However, there are significant knowledge gaps on the effect these MMS have on marine ecosystem function. Central to our understanding of MMS on the ecology of the North Sea, is having a better understanding of the background (baseline or equilibrium position) against which changes in ecosystem processes can be assessed. A few recent studies have identified the role of MMS as artificial reef structures, yet little research has examined the effect of MMS on the largest surrounding habitat - the seabed, its associated biodiversity, and the ecosystem services it provides. Shelf sediments, such as those found in the North Sea, are dominated by sandy permeable sediments, and recent research under the NERC Shelf Seas Biogeochemistry programme established that a significant proportion of 'blue carbon' is held in such shelf sediments. These sediments provide a variety of ecosystem services, from biogeochemical cycling of nutrients, carbon and oxygen; biodiversity (macrofauna, microbial); contaminant deposition; habitat provision; and production of inorganic nutrients to support surface water productivity, underpinning marine food webs and commercial fisheries. The presence and installation of MMS provides protection of the seabed from other human activities, such as trawling and dredging, protecting the seabed from physical disturbance and effectively providing an unofficial 'Marine Protected Area' (MPA). The hydrocarbon extraction activity at MMS influences local biodiversity, particularly changing benthic microbial diversity as a response to the presence and concentration of associated contaminants, and these microorganisms play a vital role in degrading the hydrocarbons within the sediments. Whilst the stability of these sediments and their ability to sequester carbon is uncertain, the decommissioning and physical removal of MMS is likely to disrupt these long term carbon stores, and impact on benthic ecosystem processes. Complete removal of MMS, following current Oslo-Paris (OSPAR) regulations could impact on the hydrodynamics and nutrient cycling at a local scale, negatively affecting biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and ecosystem processes in surrounding sediments. Furthermore, the shelf sediments may be exposed to additional hydrocarbon contaminants either via oil seeps/pipeline leaks or resuspension of oily drill cuttings, and their eventual disturbance and wider impact is relatively unknown. The presence and subsequent removal of MMS will therefore not only likely affect the sediment biogeochemistry but also the marine biodiversity and ecosystem function. This project addresses this knowledge gap through novel technologies (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) and environmental DNA 'eDNA', with modelling of environmental data alongside data from industry (INSITE Interactive and our industry partners) to identify the role of MMS on key marine ecosystem processes. We have a strong team of project partners from industry (Shell, Repsol, INEOS, DNV-GL) and stakeholders (Shetland Oil Terminal Advisory Group, SOTEAG; National Subsea Research Initiative, NSRI). This project has significant support from industry and stakeholders, and a Stakeholder Advisory Group will be established to make full use of this. Recent news reports on UK decommissioning decisions have drawn attention other European oil nations on what is environmentally acceptable, thus the outputs of this project are expected to have international interest and direct policy relevance for future decommissioning.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/T010800/1,,,,,,,,University of Essex,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15312887,,

These JPMs are also essential for long-term statistics-based design of offshore structures and to perform dynamic response analysis of floating units that are strongly dependent on the directionality of the environmental actions such as turret-moored floating, production, storage, and offloading vessels (FPSOs). Recently, some JPMs have been proposed in literature to represent the joint statistics of a reduced number of environmental parameters. However, it is a difficult task to obtain practical and reliable models to express the complete statistical dependence among the environmental parameters intensities and their correspondent directions. This paper presents a methodology, based on the Nataf transformation, to create a JPM of wave, wind, and current environmental parameters taking into account, also, the statistical correlation between intensities and directions. The proposed model considers ten short-term environmental variables: the significant wave height, peak period, and direction of the sea waves, the significant wave height, peak period, and direction of the swell waves, the amplitude and direction of the 1 h wind velocity, and, finally, the amplitude and direction of the surface current velocity. The statistical dependence between them is modeled using concepts of linear-linear, linear-circular, and circular-circular variables correlation. Some results of the proposed JPM methodology are presented based on simultaneous environmental data gathered in an offshore Brazil location.

Platforms in the Gulf of Mexico are concentrated in the north-central and northwestern regions where few natural reefs exist; they harbor unique communities bearing little resemblance to those in the natural surrounding habitat. There is evidence that the artificial habitat supplied by platforms in the Gulf of Mexico has increased the regional carrying capacity for economically important reef fish species such as red snapper. Platforms in the Gulf of Mexico are customary destinations for both commercial and recreational fishing and Rigs-to-Reefs programs of Gulf States are actively expanding each year. Contrary to the Gulf of Mexico experience, California platforms are concentrated in the Santa Barbara Channel area among natural reefs and offshore islands and they harbor fish assemblages that resemble those found in nearby habitats. Observations at natural reefs and platforms off California found that platforms have become refugia for increasingly rare and overfished species, which is thought to be, in part, a result of light to nonexistent fishing pressure at those platforms. Many of the oil and gas structures off California are nearing the end of productive life as sources of oil and gas.

Here we present a method of defining, simulating at scale, and validating realistic site-specific extreme wave conditions for survival testing of wave energy converters. Bivariate inverse-first order reliability method (I-FORM) environmental contours define extreme pairs of significant wave height and energy period (H-m0-T-E), while observed extreme conditions are used to define realistic frequency and directional distributions. These sea states are scaled, simulated and validated at the FloWave Ocean Energy Research Facility to demonstrate that the site-specific extreme wave conditions can be re-created with accuracy. The presented approach enables greater realism to be incorporated into tank testing with survival sea states.

In this article, the major results of the research project Investigation of Sonar Transponders for Offshore Wind Farms are presented. For theoretical investigations a hybrid approach was implemented using the boundary element method to calculate the source directivity and a three-dimensional ray-tracing algorithm to estimate the transmission loss. The angle-dependence of the sound field as well as the weather-dependence of the transmission loss are compared to experimental results gathered at the offshore wind farm alpha ventus, located 45 km north of the island Borkum. While theoretical and experimental results are in general agreement, the implemented model slightly underestimates scattering at the rough sea surface.

The UK is exploiting this opportunity with its consistent wind resource using wind turbines fixed to the seabed along its coastline up to 50 metres in depth.Other coastal regions around the world are considering offshore wind turbine projects and, despite some being too deep for fixed seabed wind turbines, floating wind turbines may provide the solution.18 miles offshore Peterhead, Scotland, such a test program is in operation. Known as Hywind Scotland, the project deploys five interconnected floating turbines supplying sufficient electricity to power 20,000 UK households.The next step in development is to design floating foundation structures with commercial potential for mass production. Test level projects may then be scaled up to develop floating windfarms deploying hundreds of interconnected units supplying commercially viable electricity to the world's major coastal cities.Designs for the floating bases upon which the turbines stand remain a challenge. The Hywind floating bases must be assembled in deep water Norwegian fjords and specialist heavy lift floating cranes for construction which add to the project cost. Alternative floating base designs present different construction challenges such as large widths that make assembly and launch difficult using facilities found in typical ports. Also, the UK currently has to rely on intellectual property rights owned in the US, Norway, France and Japan to take advantage of this new technology.CPDSYS Ltd is investigating how to optimise floating wind turbine foundation design and intallation. It has developed the Drop Keel concept, a compact, shallow draft design which Atkins Engineering has analysed and identified as possessing operational performance and motion characteristics acceptable for commercial wind turbine operation. Scale model tank tests are planned with Strathclyde University for a 10MW capacity unit followed by further analysis to investigate the relationship between wave motion, aerodynamic performance and motion control systems. The objective is to produce a full scale Drop Keel foundation design protected by UK Intellectual property rights that not only supports renewable power opportunities in the UK's deeper coastal waters but also meets the demands of a global export market.CPDSYS is also investigating how the Drop Keel concept may support marginal deep water oil and gas fields by providing a source of electricity in remote marine locations that could assist with recovery of hydrocarbons similar to the way that pump jacks (nodding donkeys) power onshore oil wells.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,105004,,,,,,,,Floating Energy Systems Limited,Floating Energy Systems Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15376842,,

The concentration of Cl- and Na+ was determined in lichen thalli collected on three different occasions in south-western Portugal. The extracellular fraction of Na+ was obtained by a sequential elution procedure and surface Cl- was recovered after leaching samples with water. The dispersion of element concentration in the area was studied through geostatistical analysis. Numerical values were estimated by two interpolation methods: ordinary kriging and kriging with an external drift. The latter method used the logarithm of the distance to the coast as an auxiliary variable and yielded more reliable results.

South-west coast of India is a high energy coast characterised by monsoon high waves, steep beach face and medium-sized beach sand. Waves are generally from west and west south-west during rough monsoon season and from south-west during fair weather season. Shoreline change along this coast is studied with reference to coastal morphological features. Various morphological features, modifications and chronological positions of shoreline are analysed with the information derived from multidated satellite imageries, toposheets and GPS shoreline mapping along with extended field survey. Image processing and GIS techniques have been used for the analysis of data and presentation of results. Sediment accumulation on the leeward side of artificial structures such as harbour breakwaters and groynes is used as a sediment transport indicator. Artificial structures such as seawalls, groynes and harbour breakwaters modify morphology. Shoreline south of headlands/promontories and breakwaters are stable or accreting due to net northerly longshore sediment transport while erosion tendency is observed on the north side. Lateritic cliffs fronting the sea or with seasonal beach undergo slumping and cliff edge retreat as episodic events. Spits adjoining tidal inlets are prone to shoreline variations due to oscillations of inlet mouth. Interventions in the form of inlet stabilization and construction of coastal protection structures trigger erosion along adjoining coasts. Seawalls constructed along highly eroding coasts get damaged, whereas those constructed along monsoon berm crest with frontal beaches for protection against monsoon wave attack are retained. Fishing gaps within seawalls are areas of severe temporary erosion during rough monsoon season. Accretion or erosion accompanies construction of harbour breakwaters in a stable coastal plain.

While most investigators have studied the efficacy of artificial structure by measuring population abundance of the target species, or by comparison of the resulting community structure with that of natural communities, the effect of habitat enhancement on the processes creating such patterns is largely unknown. We enhanced density with the addition of artificial structures to examine the effect of local population density on the population dynamics (e.g., movement, mortality, and nutritional condition) of juvenile Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) at natural and habitat-manipulated sites in the Florida Keys (USA). We artificially enhanced lobster density using small, scattered crevice-bearing structures that mimicked the natural shelters sought by juvenile lobsters. Enhanced density had no measurable effect on juvenile lobster mortality from predation or nutritional condition (as measured by hemolymph refractive index), but it increased the short-term residency of juvenile lobsters. The gregarious nature of spiny lobsters coupled with access to abundant prey may make them robust to high population density. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas small-scale fishers stress that exclusion zones surrounding oil rigs and offshore vessel traffic limit their mobility and damage their equipment, officials of petroleum companies argue that the fishers' mobility is irresponsible and that they pose a security threat. Similarly, government officials view fishers as irresponsible and that they overfish. We find that the negative stakeholder image of fishers established in the fish resource conservation discourse is invoked during fishing-petroleum industry conflict resolution processes, in which fishers often have the burden of proof and receive inadequate compensation.

The sea state fluctuates extensively over the long term, whereas in the short term, the wave elevation is a stochastic process. The rigorous all sea states approach considers all conceivable sea states, where each sea state involves a stochastic dynamic analysis. This approach would be computationally prohibitive if the dynamic analyses are performed in the time domain, which may be essential because of nonlinearities. The environmental contour lines approach has emerged as a fast practical method for estimating the extreme response; nevertheless, it is approximate and needs to be validated. This paper presents an efficient simulation approach for evaluating the long-term extreme response through time domain analysis. The method produces an unbiased result, as well as an error estimate. The premise is to apply subset simulation to tackle the short-term variability, while importance sampling is used to reduce sampling variability arising from long-term uncertainty (whose characteristics are more amenable to an approximate treatment for constructing an importance sampling density). Case studies are performed on a floating structure subjected to first-order and second-order (non-Gaussian) wave loads. The computational efficiency of the proposed method is found to be vastly superior to Monte Carlo simulation, with the efficiency factor exceeding five orders of magnitude for certain cases. Moreover, the proposed method is faster compared to classical subset simulation, with the improvement depending on the relative dominance of the long-term and short-term uncertainties.

A health certificate is required to work on the offshore petroleum installations of the Norwegian Shelf. Loss of health certificate (loss of licence, LOL) may cause economic problems for the individual worker. A private compensation system (OSO) was established for Norwegian offshore workers in 2002, comprising 8000-11,000 individual members of workers organisations: approximately one third of the population offshore. This study aims at describing the reasons for compensation of offshore workers who have lost their certificates.Materials and methods. Of 595 workers who applied for compensation in the period 2002-2010, 38 declined to participate in the study. Of the remaining 557, 507 were granted and 50 were denied compensation. All medical records held by the scheme concerning the 507 compensated applicants were examined. Health data were systematically extracted, analysed, and compared with general population statistics.Results. Musculoskeletal conditions were the most frequent conditions causing LOL for both sexes (42.5%), followed by psychiatric, neurological, and malignant diseases for women, and cardiovascular (19%), neurological, and psychiatric conditions for men. Musculoskeletal disorders were more prevalent than in the general population, and the prevalence of knee problems was particularly high. Among malignant diseases we found a high proportion of brain tumours and renal cancer. The causes are unknown and warrant further investigation in this population. Among women granted compensation, 78% were catering workers, while 50% of the men were process workers, reflecting the gender distribution in these working groups.Conclusions.

The installation procedure commonly involves a pile driving process which can last up to several hours depending upon pile dimensions, soil conditions and input energy of the hydraulic hammer. In impact pile driving, a hydraulic hammer delivers a series of hammer blows at the head of the pile that drive the pile into the sediment. Each hammer strike results in pile vibrations that emit strong impulsive sounds into the water column which can be harmful for the marine ecosystem. With today's increasing concern regarding the environmental impact of such operations, engineering tools which will be able to provide reliable predictions of the underwater noise levels are required. In this study, a linear semi-analytical formulation of the coupled vibroacoustics of a complete pile water soil interaction model is addressed. The pile is described by a high order thin shell theory whereas both water and soil are modelled as three-dimensional continua. Results obtained with the developed model indicate that the near-field response in the water column consists mainly of pressure conical waves generated by the supersonic compressional waves in the pile excited by the impact hammer. The soil response is dominated by shear waves with almost vertical polarization. The Scholte waves are also generated at the water-seabed interface which can produce pressure fluctuations in the water column that are particularly significant close to the sea floor. The effects of soil elasticity and pile size are thoroughly investigated and their influence on the generated pressure levels is highlighted. The results are also compared with those ones of a similar model in which the soil is treated as an equivalent acoustic fluid. It is shown that the latter approximation can yield inaccurate results at low frequencies especially for harder soil sediments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Kerala has 593 km of coastline. More than 50% of the coast is occupied with artificial structures such as ripraps, groins, seawall, ports and fishing harbours. These coastal protection structures and developmental activities played a major role in altering the shoreline position significantly. Therefore, periodical analysis and monitoring of shoreline change is the primary requirement for effective planning and management of the coast. This paper provides the primary requirement of shoreline change rate for the past 26 years using geo-spatial technology and field investigation for proper management of the coast. Landsat 5 and 7, Resourcesat 1 and 2 and Cartosat-1 data set were used as primary data source. Long-term shoreline change rate (1990-2016) was calculated using weighted linear regression statistical method. The morphological study was carried out to substantiate the shoreline change pattern. For detailed investigation, the study area was divided into five sediment sub-cells. The analysis revealed that the maximum erosion of 54% was noticed in sediment sub-cells II, followed by IV (52%) and III (43%) respectively. The result also indicated that the accretion/erosion pattern of shoreline change on either side of breakwaters was varying from place to place. The effectiveness of the coastal protective seawall was very minimal. This indicates that proper planning of any artificial structures is the basic requirement for effective management of the coast. The overall shoreline change status of Kerala coast indicates that 45% of the coast is eroding and 34% of the coast is in stable condition. Only 21% of the coast is of accreting nature. The field survey was carried out to validate the analysed results for entire coast, specifically along the coastal structures.

Unlike previous studies, the wave-induced seabed response in a spatially random porous seabed is investigated in this study. A stochastic finite element model which integrates random field simulation of spatially varied soil properties and finite element modeling of wave-induced seabed response is established. Spatial variability of soil shear modulus, soil permeability, and degree of saturation, are simulated using the covariance matrix decomposition method. The results indicate that the pore water pressure and stress distribution in the seabed are significantly affected by the spatial variability of the shear modulus. The mean of maximum oscillating pore pressure in a randomly heterogeneous seabed is greater than that in a homogenous seabed. The uncertainty of the maximum oscillating pore pressure first increases and then reduces with the correlation length. The effects of spatial variability of permeability and degree of saturation are less significant than that of shear modulus. The spatial variability of soil permeability increases the uncertainty of oscillating pore pressure in the seabed at shallow depths. The spatial variability of shear modulus and degree of saturation affects the uncertainty of oscillating pore pressure of the whole seabed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The oceanographic features of the two zones are markedly different, with influence of the Humboldt Current in the north, and the Cape Horn Current System, together with freshwater influxes, in the Magellanic zone. Both regions were surveyed twice during 2013 by SCUBA diving and pulling ropes and aquaculture cages. Both artificial structures and natural communities were sampled. A total of 22 species were identified, three of them reported for the first time in Chilean waters: Lissoclinum perforatum, Synoicum georgianum, and Polyzoa minor. The first is an introduced species found here for the first time in the Pacific. No species occurred in both regions, highlighting the very different environmental conditions of subantarctic vs. temperate waters. In spite of exhaustive searches in aquaculture facilities and on artificial structures such as harbour docks and piers, no introduced species were found in the Punta Arenas area. Conversely, 5 out of 11 (45%) species found in northern Chile were introduced. The Coquimbo area has a history of ship traffic dating back at least 150 years, and cultures of native (e.g. scallop) as well as exotic species (e.g. abalone) have been deployed for ca. 35 years. Some of the introduced species, such as Ciona robusta (formerly C. intestinalis sp. A), constitute pests for scallop culture facilities in the area, causing serious losses to local farmers. It is surprising that the Punta Arenas zone, with a history of ship traffic dating back ca. 500 years and over 25 years of sustained mussel and salmon aquaculture activity, is apparently free from introduced species. The ascidian cover on artificial structures is high, but it is made up of native species such as Paramolgula sp., Cnemidocarpa verrucosa, or Polyzoa opuntia. It is hypothesized that cold waters (5 to 11 degrees C) are the determining factor hindering the development of introduced ascidians, which tend to be temperate-warm water species. The ongoing warming in the Southern Cone may change this picture and continued monitoring is strongly advised.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,13,4,13,,,1989-8649,,,,,,,,,,,"Ctr Adv Studies Blanes CEAB CSIC, Acces Cala S Francesc 14, Blanes 17300, Girona, SpainUniv Magallanes, Fac Ciencias, Punta Arenas, ChileUniv Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, Dept Biol Marina, Coquimbo, ChileMillenium Nucleus Ecol & Sustainable Management O, Coquimbo, ChileUniv Fed Parana, Dept Zool, Curitiba, Parana, BrazilUniv North Carolina Wilmington, Dept Biol & Marine Biol, Wilmington, NC 28409 USAUniv North Carolina Wilmington, Ctr Marine Sci, Wilmington, NC 28409 USA",Millenium Nucleus Ecol & Sustainable Management O,,,2016-03-01,WOS:000422636100010,,

Electricity production from RES is determined by hydro, biomass and wind energy resources in Lithuania. Further development of hydro power plants is limited by environmental restrictions, therefore priority is given to wind energy development. The aim of this paper is to show estimation of the maximum wind power penetration in the Lithuanian electricity system using such criteria as wind potential, possibilities of the existing electricity network, possible environmental impact, and social and economical aspects. Generalization of data from the meteorological stations and special measurements shows that the highest average wind speed in Lithuanian territory is in the coastal region and at 50 in above ground level reaches 6.4 m/s. In regard to wind resource distribution in this region, arrangement of electricity grid and environment protection requirements, six zones have been determined for wind power plant construction. Calculations have shown that the largest total installed capacity of wind farms, which could cause no significant increase in power transmission expenses, is 170 MW. The threshold, which cannot be passed without capital reconstruction of electricity network, is 500 MW of total capacity of wind farms. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In Brazil, a leader in the Global South in terms of rapid installation of wind power capacity since the 2001 electricity crisis, firms have built wind farms near host communities that are politically and economically marginalized, giving rise to numerous forms of subtle contention and overt opposition. We aimed to better understand the licensing materials for wind farms and the content of the host communities' concerns about wind farms. We analyzed 18 simplified environmental impact reports, which created a legal path for wind farm construction, and conducted qualitative interviews in host communities in coastal Ceara state in northeastern Brazil. Our analysis reveals how firms appropriated and manipulated crisis in their environmental impact reports. Interviews with host community members reveal themes of ecological damage, fear, privatized land, employment, migrant workers and noise, in addition to evidence of active resistance to wind farms. These findings corroborate previous work on the overall nature of host community perceptions, add additional insight on the content of the licensing materials and expand the number of host communities analyzed for emerging sustainability challenges.

These artificial structures provide hard substratum that can be colonised and utilised by sessile and mobile organisms. The present study utilises industry-collected remotely operated vehicle (ROV) video to assess fish species richness and abundance, and marine growth type, extent and complexity along sections of a subsea gas pipeline, in 56-82 m depth, that traverses the Australian Commonwealth Montebello Marine Park (MMP). A total of 7493 fish from 81 species and 33 families were recorded from 606 analysed 10 m transects spaced across sections of the pipeline. Of these 81 species, 27 are considered fishery-target species in the Pilbara Demersal Scalefish fishery (PDSF), with select commercial fishing activities permitted with authorisation within the Marine Park. A moderate abundance (175) of sub-adult red emperor (Luyanus sebae), a fisheryindicator species, were observed along the pipeline. Eleven different categories of marine growth habitat were observed, with the pipeline possessing quite uniform coverage of encrusting marine growth (coralline algae, bryozoans, ascidians, etc.) with patchy occurrences of more structurally complex sponges and black/octocoral forms. Fish species richness and abundance of the commercially targeted Moses' snapper (Luyanus russellii) were correlated positively with increasing cover of sponges. The pipeline itself had very few spans and was never more than fractionally buried. Despite the somewhat homogenous habitats, depths, and position of the pipeline relative to the seafloor, presence of a field joint indent had a positive influence on the abundance of some common and commercially important fish species. This study demonstrates the ecological value of ROV footage obtained during industry inspection operations that were conducted for reasons unrelated to the determination of ecological information. The pipeline offers a corridor of hard bottom habitat within a marine park that facilitates epibiotic growth and the presence of reef-associated species in a region characterised by sandy sediments.

This damage and the wave conditions have received considerable media coverage. There has been speculation that the associated wave conditions correspond to a 1000-year event and that the criteria for designing offshore structures in the Gulf of Mexico may need revision. In view of what appear to be extraordinary wave conditions, we analyzed all of the measurements from National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere in U.S. waters in order to place Hurricane Ivan's waves in the context of other measurements. It was found that the maximum significant wave height (SWH) measured during Hurricane Ivan in the Gulf of Mexico exceeded the largest wave heights ever recorded in all U.S. waters, even though on a return period basis, the Gulf of Mexico has the smallest wave climate compared with all other regions around the United States. At four locations in the Gulf of Mexico, the SWHs were the largest ever recorded at those locations, and exceeded the previous biggest waves by a significant margin. Nominal wave-induced velocities are estimated to be as high as 3.5 m s(-1) at some locations, no doubt contributing to the extensive mud, sediment, pipeline movements that have been reported.

However, the impact of wind farm operation on the environment still needs to be established. The risk to wild birds is drawing the attention of stakeholders and bird conservation organizations. Carcass search is the main method used to assess the impact of wind farm operation on wild birds of various systematic groups and sizes. Assessment of the overall risk that wind farms pose to birds depends primarily on accurate calculation of carcass removal times and the detection ability of the searcher. Most studies have assessed the carcass removal time using pet bird species, pigeons, or various local birds. In Egypt, all studies conducted in operating wind farms up to 2016 had used chickens to assess the carcass removal time and in this way to the estimate the total number of bird fatalities within wind farms. The use of birds killed by a wind farm in carcass removal trials provides the actual time of carcass disappearance, in contrast with the use of other bird species. The removal times of carcasses of parakeets, quails, partridges and chickens were shorter than those of carcasses of White Stork, White Pelican, Honey Buzzard, Black Kites and eagles used in the current study and in another study in Australia. The results of the present study indicate that carcasses of birds killed within the studied wind farm remain for two to three months, while the carcasses of other species in other localities remain no more than 1 to 15 days, which unquestionably influences the calculation of total fatalities and leads to overestimation of the overall risk that wind farms for birds.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0035-5429,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-29,ZOOREC:ZOOR15604026867,,

During the breeding season, seabirds are restricted in their choice of foraging habitat and are under increased pressure to find enough prey to raise their offspring. However, information on the individual reactions of seabirds towards OWFs during the breeding season is lacking. Three OWFs located 23-35 km north of the island of Helgoland have operated since October 2015. We studied their possible effects on locally breeding common guillemots (Uria aalge) using GPS tracking. GPS tags were deployed on 12 breeding guillemots from Helgoland for 8-26 days during 2016-2017. Most individuals avoided the OWFs, but one individual in each year briefly entered the OWFs on two or three occasions. Using a point process model, we revealed a 63% reduction in the resource selection of the OWF areas compared with the surroundings (lower confidence interval (CI) = 79% reduction, upper CI = 36% reduction). Furthermore, OWF avoidance was increased to 75% when the turbine blades were rotating (lower CI = 93% reduction, upper CI = 11% reduction). Guillemots mainly approached the OWFs from their eastern edge when resting or diving, and rarely approached the areas when commuting. These results provide a detailed description of guillemot reactions to OWFs during the breeding season, and the first comprehensive analysis of OWF effects on this species based on telemetry data. The strong avoidance effect for guillemots during the breeding season indicates the need to consider the presence of OWFs when interpreting future trends in the abundance and breeding success of this species.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,13,0,21,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Kiel, Res & Technol Ctr FTZ, Hafentorn 1, D-25761 Busum, GermanyBur Biostat BIONUM, Finkenwerder Norderdeich 15a, D-21129 Hamburg, Germany",Bur Biostat BIONUM,,,2020-07-26,WOS:000556611100004,,
