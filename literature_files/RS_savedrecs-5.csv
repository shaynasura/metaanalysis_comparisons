The resemblance between these pelvic fin filaments (PFFs) and external gills of other vertebrates suggested that this gill-like structure was used for physiological gas exchange. It has been proposed that the unique pelvic fin of male L. paradoxa is used for release of oxygen from its blood into the environment in order to aerate its nesting brood, or, conversely, as an auxiliary respiratory organ by absorbing oxygen from the environment into its bloodstream. Here, we employed histology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to assess whether the morphology and molecular profile of PFFs are compatible with a role in gas exchange. First, we closely examined its external morphology and showed that PFFs develop from short papillae during the rainy season, but remain covered by a thick nonvascularized epithelium. Histological examination confirmed that capillaries within the filaments are separated from the exterior by a basement membrane and a stratified epithelium composed of four to five cell layers. In addition, SEM analysis revealed significant differences between the fin filament epithelium and typical gill epithelium. Finally, our qPCR results showed that five genes commonly expressed in gills were downregulated in PFFs relative to their expression in regular pectoral fin epidermis. Collectively, our results do not directly support a role for PFFs, commonly referred to as limb gills, in oxygen release or uptake.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,,,1552-5007,1552-5015,,,,,,,,,,"Fed Univ Para, Inst Ciencias Biol, BR-66075 Belem, Para, BrazilBenaroya Res Inst Virginia Mason, Seattle, WA USAUniv Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,,,2017-03-29,WOS:000395175300006,27862964,

One of the major processes to remove oil from contaminated mangrove sediment is microbial degradation. A study on heavy oil-and hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial consortia from mangrove sediments in Okinawa, Japan was performed to evaluate their capacity to biodegrade and their microbial community composition. Surface sediment samples were obtained from mangrove sites in Okinawa (Teima, Oura, and Okukubi) and enriched with heavy oil as the sole carbon and energy source. The results revealed that all enriched microbial consortia degraded more than 20% of heavy oil in 21 days. The K1 consortium from Okukubi site showed the most extensive degradative capacity after 7 and 21 days. All consortia degraded more than 50% of hexadecane but had little ability to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The consortia were dominated by Pseudomonas or Burkholderia. When incubated in the presence of hydrocarbon compounds, the active bacterial community shifted to favor the dominance of Pseudomonas. The K1 consortium was a superior degrader, demonstrating the highest ability to degrade aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds; it was even able to degrade heavy oil at a concentration of 15%(w/v). The dominance and turn-over of Pseudomonas and Burkholderia in the consortia suggest an important ecological role for and relationship between these two genera in the mangrove sediments of Okinawa.",,,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,35,0,47,,,1093-4529,1532-4117,,,,,,,,,,"Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan",,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000328535200001,23485232,

This study investigates the variability in estuarine exchange flow due to offshore oceanic conditions including upwelling/downwelling, and the presence of a river plume offshore (from a neighboring estuary). We address these processes via numerical simulations at the mouth of the Salish Sea, a large estuarine system in the Northeast Pacific. An analysis of the Total Exchange Flow indicates that during the upwelling season, the exchange flow is fairly consistent in magnitude and oriented in a positive (into the estuary at depth and out at the surface) direction. However, during periods of downwelling favorable winds, the exchange flow shows significantly more variability including multiple reversals, consistent with observations, and surface intrusions of the Columbia River plume which originates 250 km to the south. Numerical along-strait momentum budgets show that the exchange flow is forced dominantly by the pressure gradients, particularly the baroclinic. The pressure gradient is modified by Coriolis and sometimes advection, highlighting the importance of geostrophy and local adjustments. In experiments conducted without the offshore river plume, reversals still occur but are weaker, and the baroclinic pressure gradient plays a reduced role. These results suggest that estuaries along strong upwelling coastlines should experience significant modulation in the exchange flow during upwelling versus downwelling conditions. Additionally, they highlight the importance of nearby estuaries impacting one-another, not only in terms of connectivity, but also altering the exchange flow.Plain Language Summary Estuarine systems provide extensive biological and ecological functions as well as contribute to human uses and economies. However, estuaries are susceptible to change and most estuaries have been significantly impacted, threatening their important functionality. Understanding estuarine dynamics is critical to understanding estuarine ecosystems. Hydrodynamic connectivity between estuaries and the coastal ocean is a key dynamical driver impacting critical biological and biogeochemical processes such as ocean/estuarine nutrient and phytoplankton exchange and regulation of estuarine residence time, dissolved oxygen, and acidification levels. Typically estuarine-ocean exchange brings oceanic water into the estuary at depth, mixes it upwards within the estuary, and returns an outflowing mixture of oceanic and riverine water at the surface to the ocean. This manuscript documents seasonal reversals to this typical circulation pattern and the hydrodynamic drivers of the reversals. It highlights the importance of offshore winds and connectivity with neighboring estuaries. Improved understanding of these mechanisms can help us predict how estuaries will respond to a changing climate.",,,,,,,,,36,1,0,0,15,0,42,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USAUniv Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,,,2018-01-30,WOS:000422732100051,,

Milos Island is a dormant and recently emergent 2 Ma volcano of the active Southern Aegean volcanic arc. The deposit occurs in a 1-km-long marine rift basin floored by a dacite dome. Basin fill is a >60-m-thick sequence of epiclastic glauconite-bearing sediments sandwiched between lower and upper mixed volcaniclastic sandy tuffs and epiclastic sandstones. Host siliciclastics consist of glass shards, lithic fragments, plagioclase. K-feldspar, biotite, pyroxene, and silica and clay cements, overprinted by a barite-silica-K-feldspar-illite assemblage. Manganese (IV)-oxide minerals include dominantly delta-MnO2 (vernadite), hollandite group minerals, pyrolusite. ramsdellite, and nanocrystalline todorokite. Microbially induced structures occur in a specific lithofacies referred to as upper ferruginous and white volcaniclastic sandy tuffs/sandstones and are characterized by: (1) planar and herringbone cross-bedding, (2) small-scale, vertical fining-upward sequences, (3) (laser, wavy, and lenticular bedding, (4) marine trace fossils similar to Skolithos, and (5) beveling of ripple marks and desiccated silicified mudstone beds. These features, together with the microbially induced structures and the widespread presence of glauconite, reflect a littoral to tidal-flat paleoenvironment. The microbial mat-related sedimentary structures developed in the Mn-oxide ore formation arc recognized as: (I) mat-layer structures, (2) growth bedding structures and nodules, (3) wrinkle structures and exfoliating sand laminae, (4) cracks with upturned and curled margins, (5) roll-up structures, (6) fossil gas domes, (7) mat fragments and chips, and (8) mat slump structures, suggesting photoautotrophic, possibly cyanobacterial, mats. The ubiquitous presence of barite, in the host sediments, in the mat-related structures, in feeder-vein and bedding conformable layers, and in the gravel unit that caps the Cape Vani sedimentary rocks, suggests that microbial mats were developed in association with white smokers acting as Mn(II) suppliers, in a sunlit shallow-water or tidal-flat paleogeothermal system. The intimate relationship of Mn(IV)-oxide ore mineralization with the microbial mat-related sedimentary structures, coupled with the presence of Mn mineralized microbial fossils in the ore, strongly suggests the possible role of bacterial photosynthesis in Mn(II) bio-oxidation and Mn(IV)-oxide biomineralization at Cape Vani. It is envisaged that most Mn(IV)oxide mineralization was synsedimentary and syngenetic and formed due to an interplay among shallow-marine/tidal-flat sedimentation, hydrothermal seafloor to subaerial hot spring activity, which provided Mn(II), and active, possibly photosynthetic, microbial activity. Chemotrophic influence on Mn(IV)-oxide biomineralization cannot be excluded.",,,,,SEPM Research Conference on Microbial Mats in Sandy Deposits (Archean to Today)SEPM Research Conference on Microbial Mats in Sandy Deposits (Archean to Today),"MAY 21-23, 2010MAY 21-23, 2010",SEPM; Lund Univ; Novo Resources Corp; Univ Erlangen Nurnberg; China Univ Geosciences; Senckenberg Meer Wilhelmshaven; Freie Univ Berlin; Univ SaskatchewanSEPM; Lund Univ; Novo Resources Corp; Univ Erlangen Nurnberg; China Univ Geosciences; Senckenberg Meer Wilhelmshaven; Freie Univ Berlin; Univ Saskatchewan,"Denver, CODenver, CO",9,0,0,0,0,0,9,,,1060-071X,,978-1-56576-314-2,,,,,,,,,"Univ Athens, Dept Econ Geol & Geochem, Fac Geol & Geoenvironm, Athens 15784, Greece",,,,2012-11-07,WOS:000309369500010,,

The retrieved SAR wind speeds seem to agree well with in situ buoy measurements with only a relatively small error of 0.7 m s(-1). The SAR wind fields retrieved from the east coast of Korea in August 2007 revealed a spatial distinction between near and offshore regions. Low wind speeds of less than 3 m s(-1) were associated with cold water regions with dominant coastal upwelling. Time series of in situ measurements of both wind speed and water temperature indicated that the upwelling was induced by the wind field. The low wind field from SAR was mainly induced by changes in atmospheric stability due to air-sea temperature differences. In addition, wind speed magnitude showed a positive correlation with the difference between SST and air temperature (R-2 = 0.63). The dependence of viscosity of water on radar backscattering at the present upwelling region was negligible since SAR data showed a relatively large backscattering attenuation to an SST ratio of 1.2 dB degrees C-1.

The aim Should be the broad public denial of poison application and to consistently call to account people who illegally Set Out poison, which may only be achieved by raising awareness and public relation activities. Lead intoxication: lead shot and bullet fragments were discussed as sources of lead intoxication in White-tailed Eagles. It was agreed that the removal of hunter shot carcasses and gut piles left in the field may help to mitigate the problem in the short term. However, the switch to nontoxic ammunition is essential for the protection of large raptors, but also for human health. Collisions and electrocution: the four subtopics dealt with at the workshop were (a) collisions with vehicles, (b) collisions with wires, (c) collisions with wind power plants and (d) electrocution. The inspection for carrion and mitigation of particular railway line sections, wire-marking, the prevention of power lines and wind turbines in hazardous areas as well as the legal prohibition of killer poles were considered of major importance. As a precautionary principle, potential settlement areas of large raptors should also be considered in terms of an ecological land use planning. Co-operations: national and international co-operations were considered favourable and important, as for instance the International Colour-ringing Pro, gramme, transnational surveys (e.g. synchronous winter censuses) and habitat protection in terms of a meta-population concept, joint public relation activities (e.g. concerning poisoning incidents) and regular international conferences or) the White-tailed Eagle. Disturbance/nest protection: despite the general approach, the discussion focused mainly on the topic of nest site protection. Its realization was considered markedly difficult due to various reasons (circumstances of land ownership, hunting legislations, lacking enforcement of existing laws etc.). Funding may be obtained from the EU's Rural Development Programme in the short term, however, the improvement of the respective legislations and especially the implementation of existing legal means was demanded in the medium term.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,1608-8700,,,,,,,,,,,"WWF Osterreich, Dr GH Neckheimstr 18-3, A-9560 Feldkirchen, Austria",,,,2009-09-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14602014183,,

The continuous record covers a period of more than 15 years. A comparison (10 years) is made with Ouderkerk, a village near Amsterdam. Non-sea salt contributions, relations between ion species, long-time trends, annual cycles and meterological influence are discussed.The study reveals enhanced levels of ammonium in the Schiermonnikoog samples with respect to Ouderkerk. Also, concentrations of sulfate and nitrate were higher. The high concentrations of ammonium are ascribed to dry-deposited NH3 caused by cattle breeding, the only economical activity on the island. A significant positive trend reflects its intensifying nature. Annual cycles and statistical computations indicate prior combination of parts of ammonium and excess sulfate as ammonium sulfate. The nitrate content appears to be strongly related to ammonium (r = 0.79). In the Ouderkerk dataset this correspondence is much weaker (0.37), whereas its pH values are systematically lower. It is therefore believed that on Schiermonnikoog concentrations of nitrate are increased by nitrification of ammonium in the collector.Annual cycles of sodium, magnesium and chloride, and to a lesser extent potassium, are very similar (maximum concentrations in November, December and January, and a relative maximum in April). The other annual patterns peak in the first half of the year: maximum concentrations are found in February (ammonium, excess sulfate), June (nitrate), January (potassium) and in April (excess calcium). A combination of frequently occurring offshore winds and low precipitation amounts will account for this behavior.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,0,9,,,0004-6981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1990-01-01,WOS:A1990EU48000012,,

This paper investigates the safety of a unique full-scale 40 year old steel trestle structure of an oil wharf based on the identification of modal parameters. This structure is a typical simply -supported through -type parabolic vierendeel steel truss (SSTTPVST) structure with a span of 106m in an extended service term age. Steel trestle vibration responses were measured using state-of-the-art methods, such as ambient vibration survey, initial velocity excitation method, and initial displacement excitation method. The natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping ratios of the trestles located in land and in the sea were obtained in both the vertical and horizontal lateral directions. Test results showed that the vibration parameters identified by the three excitation methods were almost identical despite the differences in excitation levels between methods. It was also demonstrated that properly planned testing can be performed successfully even in limited conditions, such as low-level excitation. In addition, finite element (FE) modeling of this trestle and model consistency with both experimental results of natural frequencies and mode shapes were described. A mode shape node was found in the first vertical mode shape of this kind of trestle, which was proven in the time history and Fourier spectrum of the trestle vibration response. This result was considerably different than that of normal simply -supported concrete bridges on highways. The safety evaluation of the trestles located in land and in the sea was carried out using the natural frequency changes based on the frequencies obtained in three different years, including the years 2000, 2002, and 2014. The evaluation results indicated that the damage of the trestle located in the sea was more severe than that of the trestle in land, which paralleled with the visual inspection result of the trestle.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,,,1816-093X,1816-0948,,,,,,,,,,"Dalian Univ Technol, Dalian 116024, Peoples R ChinaTianjin Res Inst Water Transport Engn, Tianjin 300456, Peoples R China",,,,2016-11-02,WOS:000384814600012,,

Thus, in this study, we used an untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) platform to identify metabolic changes of Vibrio sp. DO1 (V. corallyliticus/neptunius-like isolate) caused by ITA exposure. Vibrio sp. DO1 was cultured in Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 3 mM sodium acetate and with different concentrations of ITA (0, 3 and 6 mM) for 24 h. The results showed that ITA completely inhibited Vibrio sp. growth at 6 mM and partially inhibited the bacterial growth at 3 mM. A principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a clear separation between metabolite profiles of Vibrio sp. DO1 in the 3 mM ITA treatment and the control, which were different in 25 metabolites. Among the altered metabolites, the accumulation of glyoxylic acid and other metabolites in glyoxylate cycle (cis-aconitic acid, isocitric acid and fumaric acid) together with the increase of isocitrate lyase (ICL) activity in the 3 mM ITA treatment compared to the control suggest that ITA inhibited Vibrio sp. growth via disruption of central carbon metabolism.",,,,,,,,,40,1,0,0,27,0,44,,,2045-2322,,,,,,,,,,,"Auckland Univ Technol, Fac Hlth & Environm Sci, Sch Sci, Aquaculture Biotechnol Res Grp, Auckland, New ZealandUniv Auckland, Mass Spectrometry Ctr, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New ZealandAuckland Univ Technol, Fac Hlth & Environm Sci, Sch Sci, AUT Roche Diagnost Lab, Auckland, New Zealand",,,,2019-04-22,WOS:000464094200044,30976014,

As the cables are suspended from the sea level to sea floor, a dynamic analysis is normally required to ensure that the cables are able to withstand the dynamic tension and bending caused by waves and vessel movements.The fatigue property of a conductor is determined by the mechanical properties of the individual wires and stress concentration caused by wire interaction. Previous publications on steel wires and ropes have brought light on the effect of R-ratio and wire interaction such as fretting and inter wire slippage. For copper conductors the complexity of fatigue is multiplied by the fact that the individual wires have a non-linear stress-strain behavior well below the defined yield stress limit and poor creep properties below maximum cable operation temperatures. Moreover, the interaction between the wires is determined not only by the contact between copper surfaces but also by the water blocking compound in between the wires normally required for subsea cables.A test method, simulating the fatigue mechanism in a dynamic power cable, including the effect from friction, fretting, creep properties of copper and high tension at deep waters is presented together with test results for a representative conductor.",,,,,"29th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering29th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 06-11, 2010JUN 06-11, 2010","ASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arctic Engn Div","Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA",6,0,0,0,0,0,7,,,,,978-0-7918-4914-9,,,,,,,,,"Nexans Norway AS, NO-1751 Halden, Norway",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000290917700032,,

Then, we made natural gas hydrate samples from the multi-component gas and small ice particles with the particle size controlled and with no pelletization processed, and experimentally examined its dissociation behaviors (self-preservation property). As a result, we confirmed that temperature change did not have much influence upon the self-preservation of the multi-component natural gas hydrate for the temperature range from -20 degrees C to -5 degrees C, and a difference in hydrate structure (structure-I or structure-II) did not have influence significantly upon it.(b) Our experimental results in the present research agreed with the experimental data for natural gas hydrate pellets by Takahashi et al. at Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., in both that the natural gas hydrate (which includes structure-II hydrate) also had the self-preservation property in the same way as CH4 hydrate (which forms structure-I) and that change of natural gas composition did hardly have influence upon the self-preservation of natural gas hydrate. We can conclude that these results will support validity and feasibility of the concept of applying the self-preservation of gas hydrate to natural gas sea-borne transport.(c) We compared the results in the present research with several dissociation data obtained in different conditions, and examined the mechanism of self-preservation. Then, we pointed out that several factors (difference in manufacturing method of hydrate samples, difference in thermal history of samples, influence of mechanical compression, and influence of ice content in samples) may be possibly important for elucidation of the mechanism.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,16360483,,,,,,,,National Maritime Research Institute,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14274688,,

However, the variability of EMT has not been fully described in previous studies. The present study investigated the variability of Ekman dynamics which consist of EMT and Ekman Pumping Velocity (EPV) along the southern coast of Java, based on remotely sensed data. We demonstrated the incongruity between the distribution of southeasterly wind speed and sea surface temperature (SST) during southeast monsoon which is related to the distribution of Ekman dynamics. Offshore EMT at the western region of the southern coast of Java is stronger than offshore EMT at the eastern region. However, stronger offshore EMT at the western part is inhibited by downwelling EPV while weaker offshore EMT at the eastern part is accelerated by upwelling EPV. Consequently, SSTs at the eastern parts are lower than those at the western parts. Thus, the changes of offshore EMT intensity from eastern to western parts are balanced by their EPV distributions which explain the incongruity between the distribution of wind speed and SST during southeast monsoon. On an interannual timescale, the combination of La Nina and negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events tends to weaken offshore EMT and EPV which reduce the intensity of Chl-abloom and SST cooling during southeast monsoon season.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Foraging ecology of great black-backed gulls and their impact on Atlantic puffin populations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2019,2019,"Populations of many species of seabirds have declined significantly over the past 30 years, with climate change identified as a primary cause. One species undergoing large declines is the Atlantic puffin, a species of high conservation concern that has recently been re-classified as 'vulnerable' by BirdLife International. The reduction in availability of prey (sandeels) has been proposed as a principal cause for declines, however, predation by predatory seabirds such as the great black-backed gull and great skua may also play a role, especially as these species are showing marked increases in many locations. Since both seabird predator and prey are legally protected, this may lead to wildlife conflicts, especially if management measures such as culling are proposed. Furthermore, conflicts will be shaped by the effects of other pressures on both species e.g. great black-backed gulls and puffins are potentially at risk from the development of offshore renewable energy installations such as wind farms and from the ingestion of [micro]plastics. It is therefore vital that detailed information is available on the interactions between the species involved in order to ascertain the population dynamic consequences of this predator-prey relationship, and to devise effective management strategies to alleviate this wildlife conflict.The PhD would examine the consequences of the significant increase in the great black-backed gull population on the Isle of May, south-east Scotland, on the Atlantic puffin populations. Atlantic puffins on the Isle of May have declined by more than a third in the last decade, while the great black-backed gulls have more than doubled over the same period. Past work at this colony has demonstrated that the majority of predation is undertaken by a subset of specialist gulls that generally target juvenile puffins [1, 2]. However, the extent to which this predation has population-level effects on puffins, and whether this is predicted to change in the future, has not been tested. Further, it is not clear whether potential effects on puffins are apparent more widely, because of limited knowledge of the population trends of great black-backed gull and the extent of interactions with local puffin populations. Therefore the project would involve focussed research on the Isle of May and analyses at the national scale to address the following key questions: a) What is the degree of foraging specialism among individual gulls? b) What is the age structure of predated puffins? c) What are the population-level consequences of predation by gulls on the puffin population? d) What are the predicted changes in puffin and gull population sizes associated with future changes in predator-prey interactions on the Isle of May and at the UK scale? e) What are the predicted changes in populations of both species caused by multiple drivers including offshore renewable effects and ingestion of marine plastics? Addressing these questions would provide conservation managers with the evidence they need to select the best options for alleviating this wildlife conflict.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2302685,,,,,,,,University of the Highlands and Islands,University of the Highlands and Islands,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15349464,,

A key question is the stability of foam in the presence of oil in the reservoir. To understand the influence of oil type and of oil saturation on foam stability and foam generation various fundamental experimental studies have been preformed.In this study results from static foam experiments with a fluorinated surfactant are compared with tests done with an alpha olefin sulfonate [A.K. Vikingstad. A. Skauge, H. Hoiland, M.G. Aarra, Colloids Surf. A: Physiochem. Eng. Aspects 260 (2005) 189-198.]. The static foam properties for the two Stirfactants have been investigated by variation in surfactant concentration, in amount of added oil, and in polarity of the oil phase.The effectiveness of foam generation is related to surfactant concentration. The fluorinated surfactant gave more stable foam over time at the same surfactant concentration. Foam formed below the critical micelle concentration for both surfactants. Without oil present, both surfactants have foam heights that are independent of ionic strength.In our opinion, foam stability in the presence of alkane-type oils is related to the molecular weight of the oil molecule. Foam generation and stability is possibly connected to the surfactant's ability to solubilize oil molecules. Foam tests with decane or crude oil stabilized at lower ionic strength for the AOS surfactant. The foam height for the fluorinated surfactant showed little sensitivity to oil.For the AOS surfactant alkanes that were soluble in the micelles seemed to destabilize the foam. Experiments done with the fluorinated surfactant did not show this behavior. In fact, much more foam was generated in tests with alkanes that solubilize in the micelles than for those that were not.

A one-dimensional energy balance model was applied to calculate ocean-to-atmosphere heat flux and the resulting new-ice formation over open water. For a detailed estimate of regional ice production, the flaw lead was divided into 14 sections based on the analysis of NOAA-satellite images and Russian ice charts. Opening and maintenance of the lead sections are controlled by offshore winds, whereas closing of open water is caused by onshore winds. Since the orientation of the lead varies from section to section, the same regional wind forcing can cause different local lead behavior. Model results reveal that the seasonally accumulated thickness of new ice formed in the different lead sections - under the assumption of instantaneous lateral new-ice removal from the water surface - varies from 1.3 m to 13 m over temporarily open water and may reach 20 m over permanently open water. The corresponding ice volume produced in the sections varies between 3.4 km(3) and 59 km(3) and amounts to 258 km(3) for the entire lead. The significant regional variations in new-ice production are due to differences in (i) the number of days that a lead section is open (open-lead days), (ii) the oceanic heat loss during open-lead days, and (iii) the areal extent of the lead sections. As compared to other studies, - at least during 1991/1992 winter season - the Laptev Sea flaw lead produced between 28 and 617% more initial sea ice than the Kara, Barents, East Siberian and Chukchi leads. Despite its limited areal extent of roughly 36,000 km(2), which represents only 8% of the entire Laptev Sea, the flaw lead produces about 32% of the annual shelf ice. The ice production in the flaw lead is 5.3 times higher than the remainder of the shelf (7.4 m vs. 1.4 m). Furthermore, the Laptev Sea flaw lead produces 2.6% of the ice annually formed the entire Arctic Mediterranean Sea and contributes about 9% to the volume of the Siberian branch of the Transpolar Drift Ice System. This makes the Laptev Sea flaw lead a significant producer of Arctic sea ice on local and regional scales, whereas the contribution of lead ice to the entire volume of annually formed pack in high northern latitudes amounts only to roughly 1.3%.

However, their accumulative effect can be significant. When a boat or a yacht is not moving, many boat operators still keep the engines running in idle to power the utilities. Even some people are aware of the very low efficiency and high emission of an idling internal combustion engine, they may still sacrifice the environment for comfort and convenience. Meanwhile, use of wind turbines or solar panels is almost decorative due to the limited and constrained space available on the deck of a boat or yacht.In this project, we are developing a technology at an ancient format to provide electric power to a marine vessel. That is, we try to outfit a dynamic kite with a robotic controller and a set of power generating devices to a boat. The kite will be released to the higher altitude to tap stronger wind and charge the batteries while the boat is idling and the engine is shut off. A conceptual illustration is shown in Figure 1.Figure 1: Concept of a MEHAWK system.By tapping into the ample wind of higher altitude over the sea, a boat will emit less pollutant due to the stopped engine. The immediate environment surrounding the boat will be healthier to breath. If the technology is widely adopted, the overall air quality of the planet will also be improved. Meanwhile, using kite-based wind power as an auxiliary energy source will make the venture longer, safer, quieter, more productive, and more enjoyable for the people going to open water.The availability of a secondary power source will enable new designs and developments of the boats and yachts, such as hybrid or even pure electric boats. It will also lower the operating cost of the owners and probably increase the productivity of fishing.Through developing the kite-based power-generating device, the students became more aware of the importance of sustainability and learned how to protect the planet and environment using their knowledge and expertise. If the project is successful and is eventually commercialized, it will provide millions of boat and yacht owners an opportunity to become more sustainable.

Through geochemical analysis and seismic interpretation, different fluid flow features are identified in the central depression of Qiongdongnan basin, northern South China Sea. These structures include mud diapir, gas chimney, hydrothermal pipes, faults, blowout pipes, and associated extrusions. Mud diapirs are primarily located on the slope belts, whereas gas chimneys are on the basement highs in the southwest of the study area. Their distribution appears closely controlled by tectonic stress field and overpressure, the later is caused by hydrocarbon generation and compaction disequilibrium. High sediment overloading, weak post-rift tectonic activity, and high average geothermal gradient may contribute to the compaction disequilibrium. The occurrence of gas chimneys on the basement high suggests that lateral transportation and relief of overpressure is a significant factor. Distribution of broad hydrothermal pipes is related with the thinning continental crust and pre-existing boundary faults in the central depression. They are probably attributed to intruded sills dissolution and were caused by hydrothermal fluids vertically. Geochemical data from gas reservoirs analysis indicates that mud diapirs and gas chimneys are critical pathways for thermogenic gases, whereas hydrothermal pipes and part of the faults may act as pathways of both thermogenic and inorganic gases. The blowout pipes mainly occur in the northwestern central depression near the continental slope, where fluid flows ascend gradually from a series of Pliocene-current prograding wedge-formed units with a hydraulic fracture in shallow. Hundreds of seafloor pockmarks and mounds associated with blowout pipes located above the NE-SW elongated Pliocene-Quaternary slope-break belts. These extrusive structures indicate that fluids ascend through blowout pipes and were expelled at the present seabed. Our results indicate that fluid flow structures are probably responsible for fluid activities and must be taken into account when assessing the hydrocarbon potential, geologic hazard, and benthic ecosystem.",,,,,,,,,10,2,0,0,1,0,11,,,0020-6814,1938-2839,,,,,,,,,,"South China Sea Inst Oceanol, CAS Key Lab Ocean & Marginal Sea Geol, Guangzhou 510301, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaChina Natl Offshore Oil Corp Ltd, Zhanjiang Branch, Zhanjiang, Peoples R China",,,,2019-12-16,WOS:000501057800001,,

Wood may be protected from the action of destructive agents -such as fungi, insects, marine organisms, and fire-by preservative treatment (Tsoumis, 1991). In this case, wood preservative chemicals can be impregnated into wood by various processes using a variety of carrier solvents or gases (Eaton and Hale, 1993). However, the structure of wood differs between and within a species has a great effect on preservative treatment (Smith and Lee, 1958; Comstock, 1970; Siau, 1971). This affects the preservative uptake despite the pressure being applied. Therefore, the difficulty of obtaining satisfactory treatment of some species of wood a problem facing the timber preservation industry.Because of the many failed attempts to effectively treat many of the different refractory species of wood, attempts to improve treatment may best be left to the use of physical modifications to the material, such as laser incising, improvements in drying method and treatment schedules and to the development and use of diffusible preservatives (Nicholas, 1973a; 1973b; Richardson, 1978; 1993).",,,,,16th International Conference on Furniture and Equipping of Interiors16th International Conference on Furniture and Equipping of Interiors,"OCT 14, 2005OCT 14, 2005","Innovawood; Univ Zagreb, Fac Forestry; Acad Forest Sci; UFI Paris; Croatian Forestry Soc; Slovenian Wood Proc Assoc; Zagreb Fair; Croatian Chamber Econ; Croatian Chamber Econ Zagreb Chamber; Forest Res Inst Jastrebarsko; Croatian Forests D O OInnovawood; Univ Zagreb, Fac Forestry; Acad Forest Sci; UFI Paris; Croatian Forestry Soc; Slovenian Wood Proc Assoc; Zagreb Fair; Croatian Chamber Econ; Croatian Chamber Econ Zagreb Chamber; Forest Res Inst Jastrebarsko; Croatian Forests D O O","Zagreb, CROATIAZagreb, CROATIA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,953-6307-88-X,,,,,,,,,"Hacettepe Univ, Ankara, Turkey",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000241612000003,,

While there are two main types of PDCs (fully turbulent, fully dilute pyroclastic surges and more concentrated pyroclastic flows encompassing non-turbulent to turbulent transport) pyroclastic flows, which are the subject of the present study, are far more complex than dilute pyroclastic surges and remain the least understood type despite their far greater hazard, greater runout length and ability to transport vast quantities of material across the Earth's surface.Here we present large-scale experiments of natural volcanic material and gas in order to provide the missing quantitative view of the internal structure and gas-particle transport mechanisms in pyroclastic flows. We show that the outer flow structure with head, body and wake regions broadly resembles current PDC analogues of dilute gravity currents. However, the internal structure, in which lower levels consist of a concentrated granular fluid and upper levels are more dilute, contrasts significantly with the internal structure of fully dilute gravity currents. This bipartite vertical structure shows strong analogy to current conceptual models of high-density turbidity currents, which are responsible for the distribution of coarse sediment in marine basins and of great interest to the hydrocarbon industry.The lower concentrated and non-turbulent levels of the PDC (granular-fluid basal flow) act as a fast flowing carrier for the more dilute and turbulent upper levels of the current (ash-cloud surge). Strong kinematic coupling between these flow parts reduces viscous dissipation and entrainment of ambient air into the lower part of the ash-cloud surge. This leads to a state of forced super-criticality whereby fast and destructive PDCs can endure even at large distances from volcanoes. Importantly, the basal flow/ash-cloud surge coupling yields a characteristically smooth rheological boundary across the non-turbulent/turbulent interface, as well as vertical velocity and density profiles in the ash-cloud surge, which strongly differ from current theoretical predictions. Observed generation of successive pulses of high dynamic pressure within the upper dilute levels of the PDC may be important to understand the destructive potential of PDCs.The experiments further show that a wide range in the degree of coupling between particle and gas phases is critical to the vertical and longitudinal segregation of the currents into reaches that have starkly contrasting sediment transport capacities. In particular, the formation of mesoscale turbulence clusters under strong particle-gas feedback controls vertical stratification inside the turbulent upper levels of the current (ash-cloud surge) and triggers significant transfers of mass and momentum from the ash-cloud surge onto the granular-fluid basal flow.These results open up new pathways to advance current computational PDC hazard models and to describe and interpret PDCs as well as other types of high-density gravity currents transported across the surfaces of Earth and other planets and across marine basins.

The demand for such systems is increasing steadily because of new types of systems like wind farms, ocean energy converters and floating airports. Mooring of such platforms to a fixed point on the earth makes the system secure. Dynamic behaviour of a moored system with a subsurface buoy is studied here. The optimum position of the buoy is found using an analytical approach. The location of the buoy along the cable is a critical aspect in tension reduction. An analytical method is developed for the solution of a typical mooring problem taking into account the presence of a subsurface buoy. The method originally proposed by Walten and Polachek (1959) is modified here to suit the present problem. The nodal accelerations and velocities at the points of lumped mass of subsequent time steps can be expressed as per the Houbolt scheme. Integration of the accelerations and velocities lead to the solutions of the mooring-line dynamic problems subject to constraints to achieve the numerical convergence of solution. Dynamic amplitudes vary with the frequency of excitation at the surface due to external disturbances like waves and current. Wave, current and water depths are considered for the dynamic load built up along the mooring line. A number of cases are worked out, and some important and significant results are presented in this paper. Dynamic tension variations with and without a subsurface buoy are determined. Effect of pre-tension is determined and presented. Dynamic amplitude for different frequency ratios and different amplitudes of motions are determined. The method is useful for deepwater systems in which tension reduction provides better efficiency for the performance of the anchor by providing better seakeeping ability in the case of a ship or a platform.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,1744-5302,1754-212X,,,,,,,,,,"Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Ocean Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, IndiaJ Ray McDermott Middle E Inc, Offshore Operat Dept, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",J Ray McDermott Middle E Inc,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000207913600005,,

The mean scores of 51 individual stressors were calculated and ranked. Factor analysis was used to identify nine sources of stress which were also ranked according to their standard mean scores. The top four sources of stress were, in descending order of importance: 'physical environment of the workplace', 'safety', 'interface between job and family/social life' and 'career and achievement'. The perceived sources of work stress in Chinese workers were different from those reported in earlier studies on UK off-shore oil workers. These differences might be attributable to socio-cultural factors or possibly, changes in perception to stress over time. A better understanding of the sources of stress is essential to promote the physical and mental health of off-shore oil workers.

Since the tidal current power systems are commonly installed at the rapid flow water area, it requires the safe and reliable supporting as well as the steady and high-efficiency current power generator. In addition, the rational construction and maintenance methods should be prepared to reduce the total cost of tidal current power generation systems. Until now, various types of current power structures have been developed such as pile-type, gravity-type, and jacket-type and so on, considering performance for construction work as well as soil and marine conditions.Among these, the gravity-type is regarded as the most cost-effective and reliable one, since there is no need to use large scale marine equipments such as pile driving vessels, cranes and so on. Generally, the structure of gravity-type is composed of a steel column supporting, the current power generator and a concrete basement providing the structural stability of the whole system due to its self-weight. The most failures of support structures occur at the steel-concrete connection part due to the shear forces and the fatigue loads. Therefore, the safety of steel-concrete connection is the most important to secure the overall safety of supporting structure.In this study, the structural details and failure mode of steel-concrete connections for the gravity type have been investigated. Also, the numerical analysis and the static loading test for the scaled model have been carried out to evaluate the structural behaviors according to connection details. The analysis and test results indicate that the connection detail using circular ribs is more effective to resist against the tensile forces than the other connection details.

PW is difficult to monitor as releases are rapidly diluted and concentrations can reach trace levels. The use of passive samplers can over come this. Here polyethylene (PE) was calibrated for a diverse range of PW pollutants. Zebrafish were exposed to dilutions of PW and passive sampler extracts in order to investigate the relationship between freely dissolved chemical concentrations and acute toxic effects. The raw PW had an LC50 of 13% (percentage of PW in the standardized zebrafish medium). Observed non-viable deformations to embryos (at 5 hpf) included heart and yolk edema, head, spine and tail deformations. The dose-response relationship of lethal effects showed that if 0.0041 g of PE is exposed to this PW, then extracted, 50% of exposed D. rerio will suffer lethal effects. The sum of tested freely dissolved concentrations that led to 50% lethal effects (mortality and non-viable deformations) was 2.32 x 10(-4) mg/L for PW and 7.92 x 10(-2) mg/L for PE. This implies that exposure to raw PW was more toxic than exposure to PE extracts. This toxicity was attributed both to the presence of contaminants as well as PW salinity. Passive samplers are able to detect very low freely dissolved pollutant concentrations which is important for assessing the spatial dilution of PW releases. Bioassays provide complimentary information as they account for all toxic compounds including those that are not taken up by passive samplers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The PW was diluted in SW from a Norwegian fjord, and the biodegradation study was performed in slowly rotating carousels at 13 degrees C over a period of 62 days. Naphthalenes/PAHs and phenol/APs biotransformation was determined by first-order rate kinetics, after normalization against the recalcitrant biomarker 17 alpha(H),21 beta(H)-Hopane. The results from this study showed total biotransformation half-lives ranging from 10 to 19 days for groups of naphthalenes and PAHs, while half-lives for APs (C0- to C9-alkylated) were 10-14 days. Biotransformation half-lives of single compounds ranged from 8 to >100 days for naphthalenes and PAHs (median 16 days), and from 5 to 70 days (median 15 days) for phenols and APs. Four of the tested PAHs (chrysene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(e)pyrene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene) and one AP (4-tert-butylphenol) showed biotransformation half-lives >50 days. This is one of a few studies that has investigated the potential for biodegradation of PW in natural SW.

J,,,,,,,,,"Nawaz, Anuscheh","McNeil, Craig",SCUID: A Carbon Nanotube Based Sensor for Measurement of Dissolved Gases in Water,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Dec 01 2018,2018,"This research aims at developing an in-situ oceanographic sensor platform that enables the measurement of dissolved gases of interest in the ocean in order to study the nitrogen cycle in oxygen minimum zones. This type of sensor does not exist to date and is accomplished by marrying two mature systems - a cutting edge technology sensing platform, and a proven submergible housing. Carbon nanotube-based gas sensors are considered cutting edge technology, allowing to detect a wide range of environmental and safety related trace gases at relevant sensitivities. They are low power, and have provided in-situ, real time, automated measurement of chemicals in space, for fire detection, for fuel leak detection, and as health monitoring system. Companies around the world are looking to integrate these gas sensors due to their versatility, sensitivity, and range of measurement. In recent years, start-ups manufacturing these sensors in large numbers have formed in response to the high demand. While it is possible today to measure trace gases such as N2O, NO, and DMS in the atmosphere, the sensors to measure dissolved gases in seawater real time and in situ are limited to only CO2, CH4, and H2S. Several of these climatically relevant gases are known to be produced under low oxygen conditions, such as the oxygen minimum zones in the open ocean, and ?deadzones? in the coastal ocean. Today highly precise measurement of dissolved gases like N2O and NO rely on laboratory-based analyses such as mass spectrometry and gas chromatography. Global warming is the working hypothesis for the observed expansion of open ocean Oxygen Minimum Zones; increased stratification reduces upper ocean ventilation and aeration. Expansion of hypoxia in the coastal zone is linked to eutrophication associated with excess nutrients in river runoff, from sources such as chemical fertilizers applied to farms, fields, and lawns. Marine life becomes highly stressed under hypoxic conditions, and dramatic ecological impacts can occur, including massive kills of fish and shellfish and harmful algae blooms. Longer lasting impacts also occur since juvenile fish are more likely to be affected than mature fish, resulting in detrimental follow-on effects such as economic losses. There is a critical need for a deeper understanding of gas cycling in hypoxic zones. Measurement of climatically relevant trace gases are necessary to quantify ocean sources and sinks, and to understand their impact on global climate change. The oceanographic community needs a new, small, low-power, real time dissolved gas sensor that can be tuned to different gases of interest to allow high spatial resolution sampling for specific gases of interest. A platform independent sensor can be used on floats, gliders, conductivity-temperature-depth sensors, and automated underwater vehicles for open water and coastal surveys of dissolved gases. This will not only expand the dissolved gases that a sensor can detected in situ, but bolster scientific discovery, data, and models in areas such as sea-air exchange, greenhouse gases, and hydrothermal vents. The sensing chip consists of a single wall carbon nanotube gas sensor. It is provided by NASA Ames Research Center and has been used to detect several gases in space and on earth to date. For this research, the sensing chip is trained to detect N2O and NO, two gases that are of great interest to the oceanographic community but have not been possible to detect in situ to date. The sea-worthy, submergible housing (to 2000m) will be provided by Pro-Oceanus, an expert in this field. Detection limits aimed for are 100ppb and 5ppb, for N2O and NO respectively. Laboratory testing of the gas sensor and integrated sensing system will take place at APL/UW. Field tests to Hood Canal WA), and the Gulf of Mexico are planned in year 3 of this proposal. If successful, these tests will yield unparalleled spatial resolution of N2O and NO gas concentrations, and allow us to draw conclusions about air-sea interaction that have not been possible to date. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1841927,,,,,,,,University of Washington,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13598513,,

Despite this, almost no attention has been given to its mechanical properties. The remarkable area and thinness come about because gas exchange occurs by passive diffusion. However, the barrier also needs to be immensely strong to withstand the very high stresses in the capillary wall when capillary pressure rises during exercise. The strength of the thin region of the barrier comes from type TV collagen in the basement membranes. When the stresses in the capillary walls rise to high levels, ultrastructural changes occur in the barrier, a condition known as stress failure. Physiological conditions that alter the properties of the barrier include severe exercise in elite human athletes. Animals that have been selectively bred for high aerobic activity, such as Thoroughbred racehorses, consistently break their pulmonary capillaries during galloping. Pathophysiological conditions causing stress failure include high-altitude pulmonary edema and overinflation of the lung, which frequently occurs with mechanical ventilation. Remodeling of the capillary wall occurs in response to increased wall stress in diseases such as mitral stenosis. The barrier is able to maintain its extreme thickness with sufficient strength as a result of continual regulation of its wall structure.

This is an important first stage for understanding wake interaction in turbine arrays and hence large-scale power generation. The rotor diameter has a typical value of 60% of the depth and the thrust coefficient is representative of a full-scale turbine. The shear layers originating from the rotor tip circumference show classic linear expansion downstream, with the rate of a plane shear layer vertically and 1.5 times that horizontally. These shear layers merge by around 2.5 diameters downstream forming a self-similar two-dimensional wake beyond eight diameters downstream with a virtual origin at two diameters downstream of the rotor plane. The spreading rate is somewhat less than that for solid bodies. The detailed velocity measurements made in the near wake show rotation and vorticity similar to that measured previously for wind and marine turbines although with asymmetry associated with bed and surface proximity. The longitudinal circulation in a transverse plane is conserved at about 1% of the swept circulation from the blade tip within two diameters downstream, the extent of detailed measurement Turbines are usually designed using blade element momentum theory in which velocities at the rotor plane are characterised by axial and tangential induction factors and it is now possible to see how this idealisation relates to actual velocities. The axial induction factor corresponds to velocity deficits at 0A-0.8 radii from the rotor axis across the near wake while the tangential induction factor at the rotor plane corresponds to velocities at 0.4-0.6 radii between 1-2 diameters downstream, indicating some general correspondence. For the two-dimensional self-similar far wake the two parameters defining the centreline velocity deficit and the transverse velocity profiles are likely to be insensitive to Reynolds number in turbulent conditions.

(2) An Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous (Tournaisian) magmatic arc succession developed on the passive margin. (3) A Lower Carboniferous (?Visean) to Permian rift-passive margin succession. (4) A Triassic continental magmatic arc succession.The Mesozoic-Palaeogene cover has three units: (1) A ?Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic rift succession is dominated by variable continental elastics. Thick, coarse, lenticular coal-bearing clastics were deposited by braided and meandering streams in linear grabens, while bauxites formed on the adjacent horsts. (2) A Middle to Upper Jurassic transgressive-regressive succession consists of mixed continental and marine Bathonian to Lower Kimmeridgian elastics and carbonates overlain by regressive Upper Kimmeridgian-Tithonian evaporite-bearing elastics. (3) A Cretaceous succession consists of Lower Cretaceous red beds with evaporites, resting unconformably on Jurassic and older deposits, overlain (usually unconformably) by Cenomanian to Maastrichtian shallow marine limestones, which form a fairly uniform transgressive succession across most of Afghanistan. (4) A Palaeogene succession rests on the Upper Cretaceous limestones, with a minor break marked by bauxite in places. Thin Palaeocene to Upper Eocene limestones with gypsum are overlain by thin conglomerates, which pass up into shales with a restricted brackish-water ?Upper Oligocene- ?Lower Miocene marine fauna.The Neogene succession consists of a variable thickness of coarse continental sediments derived from the rising Pamir mountains and adjacent ranges. Almost all the deformation of the North Afghan platform began in the Miocene.Oil and gas traps are mainly in Upper Jurassic carbonates and Lower Cretaceous sandstones across the entire North Afghan block. Upper Jurassic carbonate traps, sealed by evaporites, occur mainly north of the southern limit of the Upper Jurassic salt. Lower Cretaceous traps consist of fine-grained continental sandstones, sealed by Aptian-Albian shales and siltstones. Upper Cretaceous-Palaeocene carbonates, sealed by Palaeogene shales are the main traps along the northern edge of the platform and in the Tajik basin.Almost all the traps are broad anticlines related to Neogene wrench faulting, in this respect, like similar traps along the San Andreas fault. Hydrocarbon sources are in the Mesozoic section. The Lower-Middle Jurassic continental coal-bearing beds provide about 75% of the hydrocarbons; the Callovian -Oxfordian provides about 10%; the Neocomian a meagre 1%, and the Aptian-Albian about 14%. The coal-bearing source rocks decrease very markedly in thickness southwards cross the North Afghan platform.Much of the hydrocarbon generation probably occurred during the Late Cretaceous -Paleogene and migrated to structural traps during Neogene deformation.Since no regional structural dip aids southward hydrocarbon migration, and since the traps are all structural and somewhat small, then there is little chance of very large petroleum fields on the platform. Nevertheless, further studies of the North Afghan platform should be rewarding because: (a) the traps of strike-slip belts are difficult to find without detailed exploration; (b) the troubles of the last 20 years mean that almost no exploration has been done; and, (c) conditions may soon become more favorable. There should be ample potential for oil, and particularly gas, discoveries especially in the northern and western parts of the North Afghan platform. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is because SamSung derrick decided to sail despite the forecast, and the warning from maritime control center and coast guard was given to inform them that there is a high risk of collision. On top of that, shipper, Hyundai Oil, used single-hull structure when there was an international agreement to use double-hull structure. There is a high possibility that there would have been no oil pollution if it was double-hull structure vessel considering the hole size made in Hebei Spirit Vessel Case, Taking these several factors into consideration, registering to 2003 convention will bring company's consciousness to danger, and will increase the liability of the shippers (Oil companies such as Hyundai Oil Bank). Therefore, we need to register to international convention which increased the limit for compensation (Protocol of 2003 to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage), as soon as possible. Furthermore, in no relations with these hypotheses, there was a news that Samsung Heavy Industry will contribute 100 000 000 000 won of company's property to Taean. This can be shown as a repression to company's activity. It is enough to make company liable by law, and making them liable for something by public opinion which legal liability does not exist, is just driving our company away to overseas. On the other hand, it is a custom of international convention not to compensate for ecosystem by oil pollution. But rather relying on that, we need to try actively to recover our environment for a country which is surrounded by still water. Thus we need to establish a domestic law for environment recovery separately from international convention.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1226-3664,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2008-01-01,KJD:ART001248506,,

Andrew",EAGER: Integrating efficient and dependable wave power generation into ocean sensing buoys: at-sea pilot tests.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Nov 01 2019,2019,"Small oceanographic buoys enable a range of long-term in-situ measurements of ocean properties that are closely related to the earth's climate-related and other natural phenomena. Currently, such buoys rely on solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries for the energy they need for instrument operation. These researchers plan to conduct pilot tests to evaluate a new technique dependably to utilize ambient ocean waves to provide dramatically greater power amounts than existing sources. Dependable availability of larger power amounts to operate high-power instruments for long periods should be of interest the Ocean Science and Engineering communities. Additionally, the methods and data from this project are also expected to be transferable to small platforms designed for mid-ocean recharging of autonomous vehicles. This research plans to test a new technique to control the wave energy conversion process such that the maximum practical power amounts can be converted in changing, irregular wave conditions. The team has learned through detailed hydrodynamic simulations and wave-tank testing that force and motion-constrained impedance matching control in realistic sea states can enable a 4-5 fold increase in the time-averaged power amounts that small oceanographic buoys might otherwise convert. With modest hardware additions, this improvement could allow standard oceanographic buoys to use wave energy as a power source. However, the proposed control requires real-time up-wave surface elevation measurements for deterministic wave-profile prediction 20-30 seconds into the future, and a bi-directional power take-off capable of providing large forces. To that end, the pilot study will use a fully-instrumented, currently operational wave-energy converter buoy with a bi-directional electro-hydraulic power take-off, to quantify the performance improvements possible (over baseline resistive control) with constrained optimal acausal real-time wave-by-wave control of the buoy oscillations. The team will use a high-resolution, short-range radar on-board the device to infer (up-wave) incoming wave fields for deterministic wave-profile prediction at the device. Results will enable an evaluation of the immediate merit of wave energy relative to other power sources available for ocean sensing buoys, such as solar, wind, fuel cells, batteries, and diesel generators. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1941314,,,,,,,,Johns Hopkins University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14962087,,

The aim of the paper is to recognize the mechanisms of formation of MISS by analyses on hydrodynamics under the influence of the geomorphology.The study was conducted in an elongated inactive tidal channel colonized by microbial mats (2.5 x 03 km) in a progradation environment. To continuously record the water-level fluctuations, a HOBO water level logger was placed 40 cm below the flat surface for two years. The sea water enters several times a year, during storms, where the flood currents were characterized by faster velocity than ebb currents, reaching a water depth up to 0.70 m over the tidal flat. That coastal process creates MISS over the tidal flat.The most conspicuous microbial structures are the huge deformation roll-ups several m-scale, associated to elongated rip-off mats, folds and flipped over mats. The process of fluidization was postulated to explain the sand-infilling of gas domes and folds we observed. This process would result from the wave action on the water column that produces a temporal fluid behavior of the underlying sand. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model was adopted for the turbulence. For a Darrieus-type marine current turbine, hydrodynamic characteristics such as power coefficient and flow behavior were then numerically investigated. The results suggest that vortices shed from previous blade passages and the close encounter of a rotor blade with these vortices can cause a variation in performance for this type of turbine during operation at different tip speed ratios.

As the wind blows, water recedes from the upwind shore and exposes terrain that was formerly underwater. Previous researchers have suggested wind setdown as a possible hydrodynamic explanation for Moses crossing the Red Sea, as described in Exodus 14.Methodology/Principal Findings: This study analyzes the hydrodynamic mechanism proposed by earlier studies, focusing on the time needed to reach a steady-state solution. In addition, the authors investigate a site in the eastern Nile delta, where the ancient Pelusiac branch of the Nile once flowed into a coastal lagoon then known as the Lake of Tanis. We conduct a satellite and modeling survey to analyze this location, using geological evidence of the ancient bathymetry and a historical description of a strong wind event in 1882. A suite of model experiments are performed to demonstrate a new hydrodynamic mechanism that can cause an angular body of water to divide under wind stress, and to test the behavior of our study location and reconstructed topography.Conclusions/Significance: Under a uniform 28 m/s easterly wind forcing in the reconstructed model basin, the ocean model produces an area of exposed mud flats where the river mouth opens into the lake. This land bridge is 3-4 km long and 5 km wide, and it remains open for 4 hours.

There are currently very limited validated data available worldwide about the epidemiology of sea kayaking incidents. The research will raise awareness of how these events happened and their potential for serious harm. It will assist kayakers to manage their sport safely.Methods.-This was a retrospective epidemiological study of incident reports originally collected by Paul Caffyn for the Kiwi Association of Sea Kayakers (KASK). Variables investigated in this study were geographic location, month, year, participant demographics, incident severity, type of kayak and trip, environmental conditions, safety gear carried, medical problems, cause of deaths, and contributory factors. Tables and graphs were developed to analyze the results.Results.-Incidents occurred around New Zealand throughout the year, often in rough seas in offshore winds. More people were involved in September. Fifty-six percent of incidents involved groups; 20% were overseas tourists and 72% were recreational private trips. Eighty-five percent of participants were male, mostly aged 24 to 39 years old, and 48% had little or no experience. The severity of incidents increased with time. Severity was lower for women. Severity was higher in calm conditions and light winds, when the capsized kayaker became separated from the kayak, and when a personal flotation device (PFD) was not worn. Fishing incidents had a higher severity and involved inexperienced kayakers. Human factors contributed to most if not all incidents and occurred more frequently than physical events. Where medical problems were reported, hypothermia and sprains were common. Collision with a powered vessel was often fatal. The study was limited because it was based on relatively small numbers, was unlikely to capture all incidents in New Zealand, and denominator data were unknown.Conclusions.-All incidents were complex events with many variables interacting in different ways and all had the potential to be serious and life-threatening. Human actions were more important than physical events and young men were most often involved. Staying with the kayak after capsizing and wearing a PFD may have reduced the severity of an incident.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,0,18,,,1080-6032,1545-1534,,,,,,,,,,"CentralMed, Tauranga 3112, New Zealand",CentralMed,,,2010-09-01,WOS:000282163300004,20832698,

The incidences of oil spills however, negatively impacted the Niger Delta communities and the environment described as one among the worst impacted zones globally. Whilst the affected communities struggle for attention and justice for the environmental damages through protest, agitations and violence, the Nigerian state and the oil and gas industries continue with their operations. The paper investigates impact of the oil spills on community's livelihood structures and its influence on restiveness in selected Niger delta affected communities. The paper adopts a qualitative research through interviews and group discussions with social activist, chiefs, experts in the field, youths and community leaders to identify oil spill impacts on community socio-economic conditions. Data collected were analysed using thematic templet analytic techniques. The study shows a high impact on the entire communities with different factors that have contributed to the increase on social aspects of the affected.

Plant emulation needs advanced control algorithms so that it reflects the practical behavior of actual plant under varying characteristics of ocean waves. Therefore, three non-linear controllers (NLC-1, 2 and 3) for OWC plant emulation and DFIG control have been designed using the Lyapunov stability theorem. The Pierson-Moskowitz and JONSWAP irregular wave models which represent realistic sea wave conditions have been applied for validating the proposed controllers. The OWC plant parameters such as Wells turbine flow coefficient, turbine torque and electrical output power has been compared between uncontrolled and controlled cases. The proposed rotational speed controller NLC-2 provides enhanced mean output power against uncontrolled operation of plant. The enhancement in output power is obtained as 25.14% and 39.24% for JONSWAP and Pierson-Moskowitz wave spectrum. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The specific system we have developed for this purpose relies on the gas-lift capability under extensive gas dissolution. In a practical (environmental) application-the so-called GLAD: Gas Lift Advanced Dissolution System-for its optimal design and operation, the understanding of physics involved in a wide scale-range of flow phenomena is essential. In this respect, both large and small-scale dynamics of bubbly flows are covered. First, the probability density functions of bubble diameter and bubble velocity as well as the radial profile of void fraction in a pipe of 149-mm diameter are measured. Second, the liquid-phase flow characteristics such as radial distributions of streamwise velocity and fluctuation intensity of velocity components are presented. Third, the motion of isolated single bubbles of 2.6 mm in equivalent diameter is examined. Their wobbling motion and the localized movement of the gas-liquid interface are described in detail via high-speed visualization. The dynamic behavior/structure of the surrounding liquid flow is then discussed on the basis of observations through two-component LDA and two-dimensional PIV measurements. These visualization results suggest that there is a strong influence of type of bubble motion-rectilinear or zigzag-on the fluid flow and the interfacial dynamics. It is confirmed that the local disturbance caused by the bubble oscillating motion, manifested as interfacial fluctuations, is conveyed to the surrounding liquid, enhancing the liquid-phase turbulence.

This paper presents the key elements and processes of the microbial shallow gas system in the Plio-Pleistocene Dutch Southern North Sea Delta based on recent findings from different projects. Geochemical and carbon isotopic composition of shallow gas occurrences in the delta are indicative of a microbial origin of the gas. Shallow gas mainly occurs in stratigraphic traps and stacked anticlinal structures above salt structures, as indicated by identified direct hydrocarbon indicators on seismic, such as bright spots. Organic matter in the delta deposits is of predominantly land plant origin with TOC values varying between < 1% and 5%, and mostly between 1 and 2%. Simulations of temperature and burial history in combination with dedicated 1D simulations of microbial gas generation reveal that gas generation in the delta started in Early Pleistocene Calabrian times and is still ongoing. Simulated volumes of gas generation are more than enough to fill published estimated volumes of shallow gas prospects in the delta. The geometry of the E-W prograding delta sequences and the close interbedding of interglacial silty/sandy and glacial clayey/silty sediments focus gas migration updip through the foresets towards the topsets of the delta sequences, and ultimately into the anticlinal stacked traps. Grain-size based calculations of the permeability and capillary seal capacity of clayey/silty seals of the stratigraphic and anticlinal traps provided first estimates of permeability values ranging from 2.8E-20 m(2) to 1.1E-18 m(2) and capillary seal capacity values between 10m and 24m. Comparison of gas column heights derived from grain-size based calculations, cross plots of neutron and density logs and pressure measurements, with trap heights derived from seismic bright spots suggests that many traps in stacked bright spots are not filled to structural spill point. This suggests that filling of the stacked reservoirs is not related to fill spill migration, but rather to leakage through the top seal. In absence of fault and fracture zones crossing the seal, this leakage is related to the capillary seal capacity and permeability of the top seal. The leakage extends, locally, to the seabed.The microbial gas system in the delta today is a highly dynamic system driven by ongoing burial of the delta sediments and microbial gas generation.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,0,12,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"TNO Netherlands Org Appl Sci Res, Princetonlaan 6, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, NetherlandsUniv Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, Fac Geosci, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands",,,,2018-11-16,WOS:000449128000033,,

The present study hypothesized that dietary microencapsulated oils could alleviate negative effects caused by high-fat diet (HFD) in fish, thus we fed juvenile Nile tilapia with HFD (15% fat) by using normal or microencapsulated oils as lipid sources for 8 weeks. To compare the effects between different microencapsulated oils with different fatty acid composition, two oil mixtures (PL: 60% palm oil + 40% linseed oil; FL: 60% fish oil + 40% linseed oil) were used. After feeding trial, the growth, body composition, fatty acid composition, resistance to pathogenic bacteria challenge, activities of immune enzymes, expressions of inflammation genes, intestinal structure and microbiota were measured, respectively. The results indicated that microencapsulated oils didn't affect fish growth, body composition, and muscle fatty acid composition, but improved the intestinal activities of lysozyme (LZM) and resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila. Further tests showed that microencapsulated oils not only improved the structure of intestine, but also increased the number of beneficial bacteria (Bacillus and Paenibacillus) and decreased the number of harmful bacteria (Pseudoalteromonas and Roseovarius) in the intestine. Those beneficial effects are more significant between normal PL oil and microencapsulated PL oil, but no significant difference in FL oil groups. Taken together, these results suggested that microencapsulated oil might enhance immune activities in the Nile tilapia fed with HFD by improving intestinal structure and microflora. Moreover, the beneficial effects of the microencapsulated oil are correlated to the oil composition.

They often have access to brackish groundwater or seawater, making reverse osmosis desalination a possible solution. However, reverse osmosis desalination is an energy-intensive process and many remote communities are off the electrical grid. Determining the most economic reverse osmosis system configuration and electrical power source for a given remote community is a challenge due to their unique resource availabilities. This paper presents an optimization-based approach to compare the economics of different small-scale reverse osmosis systems and power sources for remote communities. In this approach, physical models describe the performance of electrical power systems composed of photovoltaics, wind turbines, diesel generators, batteries, and hybrid systems. These power system models are coupled to a reverse osmosis system model to determine the water production. An optimization is performed to determine the most economic power system configuration, reverse osmosis system size, and water storage size that meets the desired water production reliability. The reliability is expressed as loss of water probability, which is computed using hourly environmental data. Here, this method is used to configure a reverse osmosis system for small communities. Results are presented for locations in Honduras, Eritrea, and Australia. Results show that the local climatic conditions greatly influence the economic attractiveness of different technologies. The variety of solutions found using this approach demonstrate the ability of the method to aid in the design of a power system and reverse osmosis system configuration for any location.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,0,25,,,1944-3994,1944-3986,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Toronto, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Toronto, ON, CanadaMIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,,2015-09-04,WOS:000360494600032,,

One component of the North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study (NACCS) used a suite of high-fidelity numerical models to produce nearshore water level and wave estimates for the North Atlantic coast. Nearshore wave transformation for the NACCS was accomplished using the wave model Steady-State Spectral Wave (STWAVE). To represent rigorously the underlying physical processes of the modeled storm events, tight two-way coupling between an advanced circulation model and STWAVE was facilitated with a modeling system for coastal storms. Seven historical storm events, two extratropical and five tropical storms, were selected for evaluation of the STWAVE model. The storms selected were Hurricane Gloria (1985), extratropical 070 (January 1996), extratropical 073 (December 1996), Tropical Storm Josephine (1996), Hurricane Isabel (2003), Hurricane Irene (2011), and Hurricane Sandy (2012). Mining numerous data sources identified 30 buoys within the STWAVE domain. STWAVE results were compared to the existing measurements using both graphical and statistical methods, resulting in one of the most comprehensive nearshore wave model assessments to date. The performance of STWAVE improved significantly with more recent storms, particularly for Irene and Sandy. This improvement is likely the result of a combination of factors, such as, but not limited to, more accurate wind and offshore forcing, advancements in buoy technology, and a large measurement population.

We evaluated the effects of known concentrations of dispersant and crude oil in artificial seawater on live Common Murres (Uria aalge). Waterproofing and microscopic feather geometry were evaluated over time and compared to pre-exposure values. Birds exposed to a high concentration of dispersant experienced an immediate, life-threatening loss of waterproofing and buoyancy, both of which resolved within 2 d. Birds exposed to oil, or a dispersant and oil mixture, experienced dose-dependent waterproofing impairment without resolution over 2 d. Alterations in feather geometry were observed in oil-exposed or dispersant- and oil-exposed birds and were associated with increased odds of waterproofing impairment compared to control birds. At a given contaminant concentration, there were no significant differences in waterproofing between oil-exposed and dispersant-and oil-exposed birds.

The continuous record covers a period of more than 15 years. A comparison (10 years) is made with Ouderkerk, a village near Amsterdam. Non-sea salt contributions, relations between ion species, long-time trends, annual cycles and meteorological influence are discussed. The study reveals enhanced levels of ammonium in the Schiermonnikoog samples with respect to Ouderkerk. Also, concentrations of sulfate and nitrate were higher. The high concentrations of ammonium are ascribed to dry-deposited NH3 caused by cattle breeding, the only economical activity on the island. A significant positive trend reflects its intensifying nature. Annual cycles and statistical computations indicate prior combination of parts of ammonium and excess sulfate as ammonium sulfate. The nitrate content appears to be strongly related to ammonium (r = 0.79). In the Ouderkerk dataset this correspondence is much weaker (0.37), whereas its pH values are systematically lower. It is therefore believed that on Schiermonnikoog concentrations of nitrate are increased by nitrification of ammonium in the collector. Annual cycles of sodium magnesium and chloride, and to a lesser extent potassium, are very similar (maximum concentrations in November, December and January, and a relative maximum in April). The other annual patterns peak in the first half of the year: maximum concentrations are found in February (ammonium, excess sulfate), June (nitrate), January (potassium) and in April (excess calcium).

The summer weather conditions over the region are highly persistent, with offshore northerly winds of 5 to 7 m s(-1) and a daily maximum temperature of 39 to 40degreesC. The relatively cool (-26degreesC) sea surface temperature (SST) to the south suggests that a southerly sea breeze would exist in spite of the opposing prevailing northerly winds and the small scale of the sea (10 to 20 km width). A 6 yr study (1994 to 1999) indicates that the sea breeze develops in only 25 % of the days in July and August. The breeze typically lasts for about 4 to 6 h, with wind speeds of only 1 to 3 m s-1. A synoptic analysis indicates that the prevailing pattern, the Persian Trough, exists on 99 % of the days, but on the 'breeze' days the synoptic-scale suppressive pressure gradient was 38% weaker. In 4 cases for which the synoptic scale gradient was negligible, the speed of the sea breeze reached 6 to 7.2 m s-1, indicating the effectiveness of the Gulf of Eilat as a source of sea breeze. A seasonal decrease of 49% found in breeze occurrence between July and August is explained by both a seasonal increase in the pressure gradient and a decrease in solar radiation. The daily maximum temperature on the 'breeze' days was 1.2degreesC lower and the minimum relative humidity was 4 % higher, whereas the heat stress regime did not differ significantly. An increase in the wet bulb temperature that was found at the same time implies that the efficiency of evaporative cooling devices is reduced when sea breeze exists. Our study suggests that in coastal areas subjected to hot and dry conditions, where the prevailing synoptic winds oppose the sea breeze, the effectiveness of the sea breeze depends strongly on the inter-diurnal variations of the synoptic pressure gradient.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,0,12,,,0936-577X,1616-1572,,,,,,,,,,"Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Geog & Human Environm, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, IsraelOpen University, IL-61392 Tel Aviv, Israel",Open University,,,2004-06-18,WOS:000223393700004,,

It provides a habitat for the Louisiana seafood industry, navigation canals and rivers that support five of the 15 largest cargo ports by volume in the United States, and hurricane storm surge protection for coastal cities and oil and gas industry infrastructure that facilitates 90% of the outer continental oil and gas extraction. Due to substantial coastal wetland loss since 1900, the risk of damage to these industries and infrastructure has increased through time. The goal of this research is to develop a methodology to analyze the historical and future evolution of coastal hazards, such as hurricane storm surge, across a complex, low-lying coastal landscape. To accomplish this task, the change in coastal hazards is analyzed through historical changes in coastal wetlands. Specifically, isopleths, defined as lines on a map indicating a constant value of a given variable, are developed to describe areas of constant values of the ratio of land to water (L:W) across coastal Louisiana.In this analysis, a methodology is developed that utilizes land to water (L: W) isopleths to simplify the modern day Louisiana coastal landscape as represented in a state-of-the-art high resolution storm surge model. L:W isopleths are derived for the year 2010 and used to construct 36 storm surge models, each featuring variations of three distinct coastal zones: High (i.e. high wetland), Intermediate (i.e. wetland), and Submersed (i.e. region between open water and wetland). The ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) code is used to compute water surface elevations and depth-averaged currents forced by hurricane wind and pressures from Hurricanes Rita, Gustav, and Katrina for each model. Peak water levels and volume of inundation are quantified within hydrologic unit code watersheds (HUC12) in order to compare storm surge models featuring high resolution and simplified coastal landscapes.A L:W isopleth permutation of 99%-90%-40%-1% with areas labeled High (99%-90%), Intermediate (90%-40%) and Submersed (40%-1%) is found to best represent simulated storm surge that most closely reproduces the high resolution storm surge model. Simulation results reveal the methodology developed in this analysis is effective in identifying an isopleth permutation that accurately simplifies a high resolution storm surge model. This result may lead to future analyses of the historical evolution of storm surge attenuation in the Mississippi River Delta (MRD) as well as other complex, low-lying deltas. These possibilities include developing storm surge models for the years 1930 and 1970, for instance, with the same isopleth permutation to examine the changes in storm surge attenuation through time. This analysis could also be applied in other similar low-lying coastal regions to conduct past and future analyses of the evolution of coastal hazards.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,0,15,,,0378-3839,1872-7379,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 257 Mil Sci Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana State Univ, Ctr Coastal Resiliency, 124C Sea Grant Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana State Univ, Ctr Computat & Technol, 340 E Parker Blvd, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana State Univ, Coastal Studies Inst, Howe Russell Geosci Complex,Room 331, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana State Univ, Louisiana Geol Survey, 3079 Energy Coast & Environm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana State Univ, Coll Coast & Environm, 1002-Q Energy Coast & Environm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2018-06-28,WOS:000432883500003,,

In addition to the single-vessel operation mode, a two-ship tandem arrangement is employed during the transfer of cargo (offloading) from the main production vessel to a shuttle vessel that takes the oil to other processing plants. It is essential to design the system in a way that ensures that the dynamical behavior of the vessels during offloading is safe. Mathematical models that represent the motions of moored ships in the sea can be complex, particularly when detailed modeling of hydro- and aerodynamic effects is required. In this work a simplified (archetypal) model is developed and explored that includes wind and cut-rent effects, and the elastic interaction between vessels. The model is validated against time series and bifurcation diagram results of a complete, industrial-strength model, and also through comparison with experimental data, showing good agreement. The use of a simplified model produces here a more refined exploration of dynamical features of the system such as its bifurcational structure and basins of attraction. The engineering relevance of these results is also evaluated through the use of basins of attraction. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The blooms (concentrations of cells higher than 200 x 10(3) cells l(-1)) were identified in the weekly samples collected at the long-term phytoplankton study site in Lisbon Bay, from 2002 to 2005. It is shown that bloom detection at the site occurs either during upwelling events, i.e. when offshore northerly wind speed is greater than 5 m s(-1) for more than 5 days, or up to 4 days after wind relaxation. However, no direct relationship was found between the blooms and either the intensity or duration of the wind pulses. The satellite image sequences show that the Chl patterns in Lisbon Bay are strongly linked to the orientation and branching of the upwelling filament rooted at Cape Roca and the westward progression of the warm-core cyclones shed from the slope off Setubal Bay. High Chl values are typically maintained throughout the upwelling cycle along the inshore boundary of the Roca filament, covering the whole bay during the intense wind phase. During the relaxation phase, there is a Chl increase concurrent with the contraction of the high Chl area to the northern part of the bay, associated with an inshore poleward current. It is proposed that the earlier setup of the offshore stratification conditions and the shedding of a slope eddy favored the bloom of dinoflagellates in July 2004, while the stable position of the main circulation features in July 2002 favored a diatom bloom. The results add further evidence that, in summer, the ocean circulation in the embayments south Cape Roca is dominated by the upwelling dynamics and plays a key role in the development of phytoplankton blooms off central Portugal.

The aim of this study was to isolate novel compounds with antiAChE activity from the venom of upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea andromeda Forskal, 1775. The compounds of the fractionated venom on gel filtration chromatography were identified by analyzing gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy data. The structure of the isolated compound that showed the most potent antiAChE activity in a docking study was elucidated by different spectral data, including H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR. Three compounds, including a neurosteroidal alkaloid androtoxin B, were identified from two venom fractions. This neurosteroidal alkaloid showed strong acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity (IC50 2.24 +/- 0.1 mu M) compared with the reference standard, galantamine. The results obtained by a docking study demonstrated that Androtoxin B had close contact with two of the three amino acid residues of the catalytic triad of acetylcholinesterase gorge and was accommodated within a peripheral hydrophobic pocket composed of numerous aromatic site chains. In conclusion, the isolated neurosteroidal alkaloid from Cassiopea andromeda was a potent antiAChE agent with strong binding to both the catalytic and peripheral sites of acetylcholinesterase that correlated well with the experimental data. Further studies are required to determine whether androtoxin B could be a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. (C) 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Farmacognosia.

The team conducted research on the weather and climate and developed a set of forecast products designed to inform athletes. volunteers, and race managers of the wind, tidal current, wave, and weather behavior expected each day during the pre-Olympic and Olympic periods. The Olympic period proved to be a challenge with thunderstorms delaying, abandoning, or postponing races on half of the days. Thunderstorm development and movement was linked to the timing and strength of the sea breeze as well as the direction and speed of the gradient wind. Numerous thunderstorm warnings were issued with the assistance of the WSR-88D radar and the Warning Decision Support System. Frequent lightning was a legitimate safety concern due to the long distances between race courses and lack of suitable shelter; fortunately no one was injured during the lightning episodes. Forecasters benefited from access to a variety of monitoring tools and models including real-time Olympic buoy wind and current time series displays; satellite and radar imagery animation; 2-, 8-, and 10-km resolution mesoscale models; a live video feed of race coverage; and communications with forecasters aboard patrol craft offshore. Official wind forecasts, mesoscale models, and a simple vector addition model performed better than climatology and persistence as defined by mean vector error and rms wind direction error.

The three Bts are human-pathogens, but only Bt2 is also a fish-pathogen, an ability that is conferred by a transferable virulence-plasmid (pVvbt2). Here we present a phylogenomic analysis from the core genome of 80 Vv strains belonging to the three Bts recovered from a wide range of geographical and ecological sources. We have identified five well-supported phylogenetic groups or lineages (L). L1 comprises a mixture of clinical and environmental Bt1 strains, most of them involved in human clinical cases related to raw seafood ingestion. L2 is formed by a mixture of Bt1 and Bt2 strains from various sources, including diseased fish, and is related to the aquaculture industry. L3 is also linked to the aquaculture industry and includes Bt3 strains exclusively, mostly related to wound infections or secondary septicemia after farmed-fish handling. Lastly, L4 and L5 include a few strains of Bt1 associated with specific geographical areas. The phylogenetic trees for ChrI and II are not congruent to one another, which suggests that inter-and/or intra-chromosomal rearrangements have been produced along Vv evolution. Further, the phylogenetic trees for each chromosome and the virulence plasmid were also not congruent, which also suggests that pVvbt2 has been acquired independently by different clones, probably in fish farms. From all these clones, the one with zoonotic capabilities (Bt2-Serovar E) has successfully spread worldwide. Based on these results, we propose a new updated classification of the species based on phylogenetic lineages rather than on Bts, as well as the inclusion of all Bt2 strains in a pathovar with the particular ability to cause fish vibriosis, for which we suggest the name piscis.",,,,,,,,,41,1,0,0,40,0,48,,,1664-302X,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Valencia, Estruct Invest Interdisciplinar Biotecnol & Biome, Valencia, SpainUniv Valencia, Dept Microbiol & Ecol, Valencia, SpainUniv Valencia, Biotechvana, Parc Cient, Valencia, SpainJoint Res Unit Infect & Publ Hlth FISABIO Salud P, Valencia, SpainInst Salud Carlos III, CIBEResp, Natl Network Ctr Res Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Valencia, SpainUniv Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath, Avon, EnglandCtr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Weymouth, EnglandUniv North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Biol Sci, Charlotte, NC USADuke Univ, Marine Lab, Beaufort, NC 28516 USATechnion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Biotechnol & Food Engn, Haifa, IsraelUniv North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Bioinformat & Genom, Charlotte, NC USAUniv Florida, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Gainesville, FL USA",Joint Res Unit Infect & Publ Hlth FISABIO Salud P,,,2018-01-16,WOS:000419345900001,29358930,

A wide range of state-of-the-art instrumentation enabled detailed measurements of the boundary layer structure and atmospheric composition in the gas and aerosol phase to be made, providing one of the most comprehensive in situ studies of the marine boundary layer to date. This overview paper describes the aims of the NAMBLEX project in the context of previous field campaigns in the Marine Boundary Layer ( MBL), the overall layout of the site, a summary of the instrumentation deployed, the temporal coverage of the measurement data, and the numerical models used to interpret the field data. Measurements of some trace species were made for the first time during the campaign, which was characterised by predominantly clean air of marine origin, but more polluted air with higher levels of NOx originating from continental regions was also experienced. This paper provides a summary of the meteorological measurements and Planetary Boundary Layer ( PBL) structure measurements, presents time series of some of the longer-lived trace species ( O-3, CO, H-2, DMS, CH4 , NMHC, NOx, NOy, PAN) and summarises measurements of other species that are described in more detail in other papers within this special issue, namely oxygenated VOCs, HCHO, peroxides, organo-halogenated species, a range of shorter lived halogen species ( I-2, OIO, IO, BrO), NO3 radicals, photolysis frequencies, the free radicals OH, HO2 and ( HO2 + Sigma RO2), as well as a summary of the aerosol measurements. NAMBLEX was supported by measurements made in the vicinity of Mace Head using the NERC Dornier-228 aircraft. Using ECMWF windfields, calculations were made of the air-mass trajectories arriving at Mace Head during NAMBLEX, and were analysed together with both meteorological and trace-gas measurements. In this paper a chemical climatology for the duration of the campaign is presented to interpret the distribution of air-mass origins and emission sources, and to provide a convenient framework of air-mass classification that is used by other papers in this issue for the interpretation of observed variability in levels of trace gases and aerosols.",,,,,,,,,46,1,0,0,9,0,54,,,1680-7316,1680-7324,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Leeds, Sch Chem, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, EnglandUniv Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, EnglandUniv Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, EnglandUniv York, Dept Chem, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, EnglandUniv E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, EnglandUniv Leicester, Dept Chem, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, EnglandUniv Manchester, SEAES, Manchester M60 1QD, Lancs, EnglandUniv Cambridge, Chem Lab, Cambridge CB2 1EW, EnglandUniv Bristol, Sch Chem, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, EnglandUniv Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Phys, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, EnglandUniv Edinburgh, Sch Chem, Edinburgh EH9 3JJ, Midlothian, ScotlandNatl Univ Ireland Galway, Galway, IrelandTNO, NL-2509 JG The Hague, NetherlandsCranfield Univ, Facil Airborne Atmospher Measurement, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",,,,2006-06-21,WOS:000238471500003,,

Displacement is analogous to habitat loss, with areas used by divers prior to displacement no longer being available to them. However, the energetic, physiological and demographic consequences of displacement are currently unknown. If divers are already energetically constrained in the non-breeding season, they may struggle to meet the additional energetic demands following displacement. The aim of the Red-throated Diver Energetics Project (https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/rtde-project/) is to collect and compare novel data on foraging and movement behaviour of red-throated divers in the breeding and non-breeding season. Whilst this will not give direct empirical measures of the consequences of displacement for individuals, it will give insight and inference into whether divers are currently energetically challenged in the non-breeding season. During the 2018 breeding season, 74 red-throated divers breeding in Finland, Iceland and the Northern Isles of Scotland were tagged with time depth recorder (TDR) and geolocator (GLS) bio-logging tags. In 2019, 27 divers were recaptured, and tags removed but, due to tag loss and failure, data from only 21 TDR and 15 GLS were acquired. Tags provided data from June 2018 to March 2019 (TDR) or October 2018 to February 2019 (GLS, avoiding the equinox periods). GLS data were processed to reveal non-breeding season core use areas during October to February. TDR data were processed to extract dive information, with multiple sequential dives classified into dive bouts. TDR data from both the breeding and non-breeding seasons were obtained to compare foraging behaviour in different seasons. Red-throated divers showed consistency in non-breeding season core use areas amongst individuals from the same breeding site (i.e. country). The divers from Finland for which location information was available (n=4) moved westwards during the non-breeding season, from the Baltic Sea into the North Sea. By contrast, Scottish (n=4) and Icelandic (n=7) divers for which location information was available, remained close to their breeding grounds, with Scottish divers wintering around NW Scotland and Northern Ireland and Icelandic divers remaining around the north coast of Iceland. From June 2018 to March 2019, a total of 275,091 dives in 14,917 dive bouts were recorded, with a mean of 710 bouts per individual or 16 bouts per day (n=912 days of data, across all individuals). Almost all dives had a maximum dive depth (MDD) of <20 metres, with 2-6 metres being the most frequent MDD. Individual divers showed substantial variation in MDD, dive bout duration (DBD) and daily total dive bout time (TDBT). In Iceland, mean MDD remained relatively consistent between the breeding and non-breeding seasons, whereas in Scotland and Finland, mean MDD increased with birds tending to dive deeper as the non-breeding season progressed. Mean DBD was relatively consistent in Scotland across the whole study period, at around 10-15 minutes per dive bout, whereas in Iceland and Finland mean DBD increased as the non-breeding season progressed to a peak of approximately 25-30 minutes per dive bout. Mean TDBT was lower for Scottish birds, at approximately 3 hours per day, compared with Finnish and Icelandic divers, at approximately 4-5 hours per day. TDBT was relatively consistent across the study period at all sites, showing no substantial changes with season, although there was substantial individual variation in time spent diving each day. We did not have data on light levels experienced by all birds at all times, so instead inferred diurnal and nocturnal foraging behaviour by assessing diving activity by hour of day, termed here Die! Dive Activity' (DDA). DDA was found to be consistent among individuals, with no divers diving for long periods either side of midnight. For Icelandic and Finnish birds in midwinter, almost all divers were diving for a period either side of midday, suggesting that all birds were foraging only during periods of daylight. This suggests that divers choose to forage only during daylight hours. During the 2019 breeding season, more TDR and GLS tags were deployed on divers at the same three breeding locations. Attempts will be made to retrieve these tags in the 2020 breeding season. Once these data are available, further analyses will be conducted on the foraging and movement behaviour of red-throated divers during the non-breeding season and conclusions drawn about the behaviour and energetics of this species at this time.

In particular, the noise generated during the installation of foundation piles for the offshore wind industry is considered to be harmful for aquatic species. A reliable prediction of the underwater noise during the installation of a foundation pile is thus essential for the proper assessment of the ecological impact. In this paper, the structure-borne wave radiation is investigated with the help of a semi-analytical model for two cases. The first case considers a pile that is installed with the help of an impact hammer, whereas the second one deals with a pile that is driven into the seabed with the help of a vibratory device. The spatial distribution and the frequency content of the radiated sound are analyzed, and the differences are highlighted between the two cases. The model is validated with data available in the literature that were collected during several measurement campaigns. Subsequently, the predicted noise levels are converted into an equivalent index that reflects the auditory damage to certain marine species, and a method is presented for the derivation of zones of impact around the pile that are based on the noise predictions by the models and the chosen method of installation. This approach can be used to define critical zones within which a predefined level of auditory damage is to be expected based on a specific installation scenario.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,0,13,,,2077-1312,,,,,,,,,,,"Delft Univ Technol, Sect Offshore Engn, Dept Hydraul Engn, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, NetherlandsDelft Univ Technol, Sect Struct Mech, Dept Struct Engn, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands",,,,2016-09-01,WOS:000443616100003,,

These remote observations provide a rigorous validation of whole-disk Earth model simulations used to better understand remotely detectable extrasolar planet characteristics. We have used these data to upgrade, correct, and validate the NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory three-dimensional line-by-line, multiple-scattering spectral Earth model. This comprehensive model now includes specular reflectance from the ocean and explicitly includes atmospheric effects such as Rayleigh scattering, gas absorption, and temperature structure. We have used this model to generate spatially and temporally resolved synthetic spectra and images of Earth for the dates of EPOXI observation. Model parameters were varied to yield an optimum fit to the data. We found that a minimum spatial resolution of similar to 100 pixels on the visible disk, and four categories of water clouds, which were defined by using observed cloud positions and optical thicknesses, were needed to yield acceptable fits. The validated model provides a simultaneous fit to Earth's lightcurve, absolute brightness, and spectral data, with a root-mean-square (RMS) error of typically less than 3% for the multiwavelength lightcurves and residuals of similar to 10% for the absolute brightness throughout the visible and NIR spectral range. We have extended our validation into the mid-infrared by comparing the model to high spectral resolution observations of Earth from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, obtaining a fit with residuals of similar to 7% and brightness temperature errors of less than 1 K in the atmospheric window. For the purpose of understanding the observable characteristics of the distant Earth at arbitrary viewing geometry and observing cadence, our validated forward model can be used to simulate Earth's time-dependent brightness and spectral properties for wavelengths from the far ultraviolet to the far infrared.",,,,,,,,,124,0,0,0,22,0,140,,,1531-1074,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Washington, Dept Astron, Seattle, WA 98195 USACALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USANASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USAUniv Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USAHarvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USAMIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USAJohns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD USA",,,,2011-06-01,WOS:000292086900002,21631250,

In most cases, the use of heavy or contaminated fuels (by Na, S, V) in such combustion equipment is the life-limiting factor for the metallic parts constituting the hot gas path. Since several years, a burner rig was developed in the laboratory to evaluate the corrosiveness of the ash deposit formed on the gas turbine alloys in dynamic conditions. It hits been designed to easily adapt the ash deposit rate and the level of the contaminants.The first part of the present paper is devoted to the evaluation of the resistances of several types of metallic coatings against sodium-induced hot corrosion. These coatings were deposited on IN738 alloy and have been treated during 1000h of test. For this, a NaCl solution was injected in the hot Gas flux to obtain a deposit rate of 1 mg/cm(2)/100h at 850degreesC. Different types of aluminide coatings obtained by pack cementation were tested and compared to a NiCrAlY coating produced by LPPS process. Among all these coatings, the Pt-modified alumides show the best anti-corrosion behaviour against the Na-induced hot corrosion.In the second part, the burner rig has been used to test additives introduced into crude oil burned in gas turbines. Indeed, the usual and low-cost defence against (Na,V)-induced hot corrosion is the addition to the fuel of some metals as corrosion inhibitors. To simulate this corrosion and its inhibition in the burner rig, an aqueous solution containing adjusted concentrations of sodium, vanadium with or without inhibitor was injected into the combustion gas just after the burner. A Mg/V ratio equal to 3 was tested to evaluate the efficiencies of the inhibition and the deposition rate in the presence of magnesium.",,,,,6th International Symposium on High Temperature Corrosion and Protection of Materials6th International Symposium on High Temperature Corrosion and Protection of Materials,"MAY 16-21, 2004MAY 16-21, 2004",Univ Henri Poincare; ORNL; EPRI; CEFRACOR; European Federat CorrosUniv Henri Poincare; ORNL; EPRI; CEFRACOR; European Federat Corros,"Les Embiez, FRANCELes Embiez, FRANCE",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,0255-5476,,0-87849-945-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ Nancy 1, Lab Chim Solide Mineral, CNRS, UMR 7555, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France",,,,2004-01-01,WOS:000223339700109,,

The consistent rise in offshore oil exploration activities in the last 2 decades has compelled structural engineers and researchers to better understand, the process of corrosion in offshore steel structures. The various electrochemical methods available for corrosion monitoring are polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and electro chemical noise (ECN) techniques. In offshore industry, the reliable interpretation of electrochemical noise is particularly valuable since it promises new type of online monitoring device. This paper introduces ECN as an online corrosion-monitoring tool for marine structures. The paper discusses the laboratory experiments conducted on test specimens to collect data related to the electrochemical behavior of structural steel such as the polarization data, impedance measurements, electrochemical, potential, and current noise measurements. Investigations were carried out on MS coupons surface prepared and coated with anticorrosive and antifouling paints. An electrochemical workstation capable of collecting data from specimens coated with paint was used for noise data collection. Static corrosion tests have been done and the corrosion rate and corrosion resistance of the coatings were assessed using the statistical analysis. The electrochemical noise data were compared with that of polarization and impedance data and a good correlation between corrosion rates was obtained. The polarization and noise resistance were found to be similar in trend but with variation in numerical values. Statistical parameters like mean, standard deviation, skew, and kurtosis were generated from the obtained noise. These parameters were then processed to obtain noise resistance and corrosion rate. The results were compared with that of polarization and impedance values. The corrosion rate comparison showed a deviation of 10% from polarization with ECN giving the upper bound values. The damage prediction and expected life prediction of a steel jacket platform were also performed using the data collected. The experiments showed a good correlation between the noise resistances obtained from various electrochemical methods.

This paper presents physicochemical characterization of aerosols observed during meteorological conditions characteristics of coastal areas. In particular, we study the influence of sea-breezes and land-breezes as well as the fetch variation, which superpose on larger synoptic conditions, on aerosol properties. This was achieved using a physical, chemical and optical analysis of the aerosol data acquired in May 2007 on the French Mediterranean coast. The aerosol distributions were measured using a TSI SMPS 3081 model and the chemical characterization was made using an Ion Chromatography analysis (IC) and a thermo-optical technique. In addition, aerosol optical characteristics were provided by aethalometer (absorption) and nephelometer (scattering) measurements. For low wind speeds, we detect high aerosol number concentrations as well as high NO3- and carbonaceous compounds contributions, which are observed even when the aerosol is sampled in pure maritime air masses. These results indicate that air masses are strongly impacted by pollution transported over the Mediterranean. In addition, the combination of low wind speeds and land/sea-breezes lead to the production of new ultrafine particle formation events that seem to take place over the sea before being transported back to the coast. Under higher wind speed conditions, aerosol number and mass concentrations of smaller sizes are significantly lowered due to the dispersion of anthropogenic pollutants. Optical measurements reveal that mean scattering and absorbing coefficients are about 15.2 Mm(-1) and 3.6 Mm(-1), respectively. Associated mean aerosol single scattering albedo is found to be about 0.87 and 0.94 (at 520 nm) for continental and maritime influences. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A locally refined, near the individual turbines, background unstructured Cartesian grid enables LES across a range of geometric scales of relevance spanning approximately 5 orders of magnitude. The simulated flow field is compared with a baseline LES of the flow in the East River without turbines. While velocity deficits and increased levels of turbulence kinetic energy are observed in the vicinity of the turbine wakes, away from the turbines as well as on the water surface only a small increase in mean momentum is found. Therefore, our results point to the conclusion that MHK energy harvesting from large rivers is possible without a significant disruption of the river flow.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,,,0043-1397,1944-7973,,,,,,,,,,"Argonne Natl Lab, Math & Comp Sci Div, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USAUniv Chicago, Flash Ctr Computat Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USASUNY Stony Brook, Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USAVerdant Power Inc, New York, NY USAUniv Minnesota, Dept Mech Engn, St Anthony Falls Lab, 111 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Verdant Power Inc,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000456949300010,,

However, the wave energy industry is currently at a significant juncture in its development, facing a number of challenges which require that research re-focuses on a holistic techno-economic perspective, where the economics considers the full life cycle costs of the technology. It also requires development of WECs suitable for niche markets, because in Europe there are inequalities regarding wave energy resources, wave energy companies, national programs and investments. As a result, in Europe there are leading and non-leading countries in wave energy technology. The sector also needs to increase confidence of potential investors by reducing (non-)technological risks. This can be achieved through an interdisciplinary approach by involving engineers, economists, environmental scientists, lawyers, regulators and policy experts. Consequently, the wave energy sector needs to receive the necessary attention compared to other more advanced and commercial offshore energy technologies (e.g., offshore wind). The formation of the first open pan-European network with an interdisciplinary approach will contribute to large-scale WEC array deployment by dealing with the current bottlenecks. The WECANet (Wave Energy Converter Array Network) European COST Action, introduced in September 2018 and presented in this paper, aims at a collaborative and inclusive approach, as it provides a strong networking and collaboration platform that also creates the space for dialogue between all stakeholders in wave energy. An important characteristic of the Action is that participation is open to all parties interested and active in the development of wave energy. Previous activities organised by WECANet core group members have resulted in a number of joint European projects and scientific publications. WECANet's main target is the equal research, training, networking, collaboration and funding opportunities for all researchers and professionals, regardless of age, gender and country in order to obtain understanding of the main challenges governing the development of the wave energy sector.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,,2073-4441,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Ghent, Dept Civil Engn, Technol Pk 60, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium",,,,2019-06-01,WOS:000475346300137,,

Most of the oils are primarily terrestrially sourced, and it is possible to recognize varying contributions from source rocks within the Paleogene Kapuni Group and late Cretaceous Pakawau Group. This distinction is attributable to the rise to dominance of angiosperms over gymnosperms in coastal plain swamp communities by the Eocene. Apart from the Maui family (i.e., Maui field, Maui-4, and Moki-1) oils, the inferred relative contributions from the main source rock types generally correlate with the relative proportions of suitably thick and mature units near reservoirs, given that most Cretaceous-sourced oil appears to have escaped prior to trap development. Maui family oils do appear to be primarily sourced by Rakopi Formation (late Cretaceous) coals. In the northern part of the Taranaki Peninsula, where heat flows are highest, Mangahewa/Kaimiro formation (Eocene) coals are the chief sources of oils. Farther south, in the Kapuni and Kupe south fields, Farewell Formation (Paleocene) coals appear to be the main oil source rocks. Biomarkers suggest that the onset of oil expulsion from coals occurs at a maturity level corresponding to a vitrinite reflectance of ca. 0.8% R(0), and may be aided by the evolution of large volumes of carbon dioxide. The terrestrial influence on Paleogene source rocks diminishes to the north-northwest of the basin and increasing marine contributions to oils are observed. A late Paleocene marine black shale is the source of oil in the Kora volcanic structure. It is possible that shales interbedded with coals, reflecting periodic marine incursions of coastal flood plains, also contribute to oil generation throughout much of the basin.",,,,,,,,,101,5,0,0,1,0,109,,,0149-1423,1558-9153,,,,,,,,,,"IND RES LTD, GRACEFIELD RES CTR, LOWER HUTT, NEW ZEALANDUNIV OKLAHOMA, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA",,,,1994-10-01,WOS:A1994PK80900005,,
J,,,,,,,,,Richard Willden,,Tidal Stream Energy - Designing for Performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2018,2018,"The fellowship will provide leadership in tidal stream energy research that will promote cost and risk reduction, through design for increased performance, maintainability and reliability, thus accelerating the realization of commercial energy supply from tidal streams.Tidal stream energy can make a substantial contribution to UK and worldwide renewable energy targets, helping to achieve emissions reductions and climate change objectives. The potential for energy generation by hydrokinetic tidal stream turbines is well accepted and the predictability of the resource is a significant benefit that will facilitate integration into the wider electricity system. Tidal stream energy offers an as yet largely untapped source of renewable energy; global resources are estimated at 100 to 500 TWh/yr, with around 20 TWh/yr estimated to be within the UK's waters. Various commercial tidal stream systems are under development with most emphasis on design and control of individual turbines. There has been some cascade of knowledge and technology from the wind energy industry. Turbines are typically 15-20 m in diameter, rated capacity 1-2 MW at flow speeds of around 2-3 m/s, and designed to be deployed in flows of up to 40 m depth. Over the next few years the first small scale tidal stream turbine arrays, 5-20 MW each, are planned to be deployed in France and the UK.However, significant improvements in performance, reliability, deployability, maintainability and thus economic viability are needed if tidal stream energy is to be deployed at a sufficiently large scale to contribute to commercial electricity markets. This requires that power output per MW installed is increased, expenditure per MW installed and the risk of cost variations are reduced. Installation costs are both high and extremely variable, with current cost estimated at £200/MWh reducing to £120/MWh accounting for future economies in scale production and deployment.The, sometimes implicit, assumption, and basis for current tidal farm proposals, is that turbines will be installed on individual seabed mountings in an underwater wind turbine style farm with turbines positioned to minimally interact with each other. Motivated by the necessity to dramatically improve the economic viability of tidal installations, this proposal will challenge these assumptions and seek revolutionary new solutions in the form of closely coupled turbine arrays using constructive interference effects to enhance array performance. It is known that there is a potential uplift in performance of up to 35% available through arraying turbines in a multi-rotor fence that partially spans the width of a much wider channel (Nishino & Willden 2012). This fellowship will seek to develop the underlying science, engineering tools and rotor designs required to deliver this significant performance uplift and the inferred expected reduction in cost of energy of circa 10-20%. A combination of analytic, numerical and experimental activities will be used to deliver the understanding, engineering tools and design guidelines for turbines designed to operate in confined tidal channels, multi-rotor tidal fences incorporating mutual constructive interference effects, high speed rotors, design against cavitation, and flow and pitch control strategies.This fellowship will involve close and sustained engagement with both the academic and industrial marine energy communities, internationally as well as within the UK. Academic engagement will be achieved through traditional publication means, journal articles, international conferences and workshops, as well as active participation in the UK academic marine energy network UKCMER, and in international academic collaborations. The resulting turbine technologies, engineering models and design guidelines will be developed in close cooperation with the tidal energy industry in order to maximise impact and accelerate the realization of commercial energy supply from tidal streams.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/R007322/1,,,,,,,,University of Oxford,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15360169,,

Following a wellhead blowout that destroyed the drilling platform, 4.9 million barrels of petroleum flowed into the Gulf of Mexico over 87 days and the spill expanded to cover 68,000 square miles of sea surface. However, despite the expansive scope of the event, systematic surveys of affected coastal populations found only modest effects on mental health and substance abuse. An established trauma signature (TSIG) methodology was used to examine the psychological consequences in relation to exposure to the unique constellation of hazards associated with the spill. A hazard profile, a matrix of psychological stressors, and a trauma signature summary for the affected Gulf Coast population-in terms of exposure to hazard, loss, and change-were created specifically for this human-generated ecological disaster. Psychological risk characteristics of this event included: human causation featuring corporate culpability, large spill volume, protracted duration, coastal contamination from petroleum products, severe ecological damage, disruption of Gulf Coast industries and tourism, and extensive media coverage. The multiple impact effect was notable due to prior exposure of the region to Hurricane Katrina. These stressors were counterbalanced by the relative absence of other prominent risks for distress and psychopathology. Coastal residents did not experience significant onshore spill-related mortality or severe injury, shortages of survival needs, disruption of vital services (health care, schools, utilities, communications, and transportation), loss of homes, population displacement, destruction of the built environment, or loss of social supports. Initial acute economic losses were partially offset by large-sum BP payments for cleanup and recovery of the coastal economy. Not only did Gulf Coast populations display remarkable resilience in the face of daunting challenges, the behavioral health impact of the Deepwater Horizon spill appears to have been blunted by the absence of major evidence-based risks for psychological distress and disorder, the exemplary response, and the infusion of economic resources.",,,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,6,0,35,,,1094-3412,1556-3308,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, DEEP Ctr, Ctr Disaster & Extreme Event Preparedness, Sunny Isles Beach, FL 33160 USAJohns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Baltimore, MD USAUniv Calif Irvine, Dept Psychol & Social Behav, Irvine, CA USAUniv Edinburgh, Dept Clin & Hlth Psychol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandColumbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY USAColumbia Univ, New York State Psychiat Inst, New York, NY USA",Univ Miami,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000347420100006,24658774,

A two-dimensional finite element model is generated in OpenSees to simulate nearshore seabed soil reaction to progressive wave loading by coupling pore water pressure and soil particle displacement. Wave loading is applied at the surface of a two-dimensional rectangular seabed domain as vertical pressure as well as pore water pressure. The numerical model is justified by comparing with analytical solution using different material parameters. A parametric study on model boundary effects shows that for the same wavelength wave, effective finite element domain size is not related to the full domain size as long as the lateral domain size is at least one wavelength. Soil liquefaction potential at different locations is studied with changing wave frequencies. A standing wave situation is also examined to simulate an ideally fully reflected wave in front of a coastal structure. The node and anti-node location of the standing wave greatly affect the liquefaction potential prediction. The results show that the wave properties are important for predicting soil liquefaction depth as well as liquefaction initiation time.

The vertical structure of the mean current suggests that NI-TWCIB intrudes into the Jiangsu coasts from the bottom. The observed bottom residual currents run continuously northward at 32 degrees N from June 12 to August 22, 2014. Synoptic-scale variations of the residual currents indicate that the bottom NI-TWCIB is highly influenced by synoptic process such as wind. Significant variations of the paths of NI-TWCIB are observed from salinity data. The intrusion paths are extracted using a horizontal salinity gradient method, and we characterize the paths by defining the eastern boundary, northern boundary and turning point. The monsoon over the Yellow and East China Seas plays an important role in the variations of the paths of the bottom NI-TWCIB. The pressure gradient set up through Ekman transport and surface transport by easterly and northerly winds promotes the offshore movement of the bottom NI-TWCIB, the northward intrusion, and the northward movement of the turning point. The westerly and southerly winds have opposite effects. We propose a regression method to estimate the intrusion path as a function of east-west winds and north-south winds. The regression results prove that the northern boundary of the bottom NI-TWCIB can arrive at approximately 32 degrees N, which is consistent with ADCP measurements. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Without considering ebullition effects, preliminary calculations indicate that a 10% reduction of dissolved oxygen can be achieved in the low oxygen zones of the Gulf of Mexico in 4 - 190 days at the estimated methane fluxes. With funding from this NSF Rapid Response Research (RAPID) award, researchers from Texas A&M University in collaboration with a scientist from Yale University, will analyze water column samples for methane concentrations and stable isotopes, as well as measure the air-sea flux of methane, ethane, propane, carbon dioxide and del13C-CO2. In addition, dissolved oxygen measurements, methane oxidation rates, and the effect of microbial community structure on methane, oil, and oxygen concentrations will be assessed. Results will be used to test the following hypotheses: (1) Significant and quantifiable amounts of methane released rapidly from naturally decomposing oceanic clathrate hydrates will be both dissolved in the water column and emitted to the atmosphere, and (2) The oxidation and ebullition of methane in the water column will significantly contribute to the low oxygen zones in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Even though geochemical data has shown significant clathrate decomposition in the past, little, if any, information is available of whether methane released during these events entered the atmosphere or was retained in the ocean. This deepwater anthropogenic spill of oil and methane into the Gulf of Mexico can be used as an analog for a natural rapidly decomposing clathrate hydrate and provide much needed information on the fate of methane released during these past events.

Nitric oxide gas (NO), for example, is a key intermediate in the global nitrogen cycle, and plays important roles in many processes in almost all forms of life, often acting as a signalling molecule. However, emissions of NO and the toxic gas nitrogen dioxide (collectively known as NOx) from heavy industry and motor vehicles alter the composition of nitrogen compounds in the atmosphere and are highly damaging both directly and indirectly to the human respiratory system. The removal of NOx from exhaust emissions is a pressing environmental concern and an important target for industrial catalysis research, an area of extreme importance to the UK economy.We propose to study the chemistry of nitrogen oxides in biological and industrial environments where a full understanding of how the gases are controlled is crucial but still lacking. In both cases the chemistry is controlled by transition metals: cytochrome c' proteins have evolved an extraordinary degree of control of NO through binding to an iron complex which discriminates against other diatomic gases, while in zeolite catalysts (microporous aluminosilicate structures) NOx gases can be converted into safer by-products at copper centres through the addition of ammonia in a process known as selective catalytic reduction (SCR). The precise mechanisms, however, are not currently proven.We will investigate the chemistry of nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxide in both systems by computational simulations performed on high performance clusters. The resulting data will be used to model spectroscopic signatures, i.e. how electromagnetic radiation (such as light or X-rays) interacts with matter. These will be compared with the results of infrared, Raman, UV-visible and X-ray absorption experiments on the two systems to better understand the processes involved in the chemical reactions, which will inform the future design of improved zeolite catalysts and bioengineered proteins.We will use quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) modelling to identify the reaction mechanisms and calculate spectroscopic signatures of the two systems. In this approach the zeolite and protein active sites will be treated using a highly accurate, but computationally expensive, quantum mechanical level of theory, embedded in an environment described by an efficient classical calculation. New QM/MM methods will be implemented that can enable larger QM regions to be calculated and more accurate spectroscopic signatures including anharmonic vibrational effects. Importantly, our approach for combining computational modelling with experimental results will be generally applicable to any chemical processes in complex systems, including other industrial catalysts and biomolecules.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/R001847/1,,,,,,,,Stfc - Laboratories,Stfc - Laboratories,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15349052,,

The flights were organized to sample air masses from the geographic area of central Brazil, where the vegetation, a savanna-type environment with the local name of ''cerrado'', is subject to burning every year, especially through August, September, and October. These measurements were made as a Brazilian local contribution to the international field campaign organized by NASA, the Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry Near the Equator-Atlantic (TRACE A) mission, and the Southern African Fire Atmospheric Research Initiative (SAFARI). The major NASA TRACE A mission used the NASA DC 8 aircraft, with most flights over the South Atlantic Ocean region. In Brazil, missions using small aircraft measured ozone and carbon dioxide continuously, and carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, and methane using grab sampling. In addition, ground-based measurements were made continuously over most of the dry months of 1992, and ozonesondes were launched at three different sites. Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite-East (GOES E) images and a special network of radio soundings provided meteorological information, and advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) images indicated the distribution of fire pixels in the region of interest. Most of the biomass burning in 1992 occurred in the state of Tocantins, with about 22% of all the burning in Brazil. The state of Mate Grosso was second, with 19% of all burning. The Brazilian aircraft was used mostly in these two states, near the cities of Porto Nacional and Cuiaba, for in situ sampling; 31 vertical profiles were made in air masses considered to be well mixed, that is, not in fresh plumes. Although the major interest was the dry season, sampling was also made during the previous wet season period in April 1992 for comparison; 10 vertical profiles were obtained using the same aircraft and measurement techniques. There is a clear difference between these two opposite seasonal periods, most evident in the O-3 and CO data. Both Cuiaba and Porto Nacional show some 30-60 parts. per billion by volume (ppbv) larger methane concentrations, for example, during the dry season, in comparison to the wet season, the difference at Cuiaba being larger. The methane data for the wet season show no significant differences between Cuiaba and Porto Nacional mixing ratios, which seems to exclude the existence of significant sources or sinks at these sites during this wet season. The ozone mixing ratios vary around 15 +/- 5 ppbv in the wet season, and from a minimum of 35 to a maximum of 70 +/- 10 ppbv, depending on height, in the dry season. The largest variability is seen in the carbon monoxide mixing ratios which vary from 90-100 ppbv in the wet season to maxima of 300 at 3.3 km and 600 ppbv at 1.2 km height in the dry season.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,0,16,,,2169-897X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-10-30,WOS:A1996VQ49300039,,
J,,,,,,,,,Graham Burdge,,Can oils derived from genetically-modified plants replace fish oil as a source of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the human diet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 30 2016,2016,"Omega-3 fats called EPA and DHA are known to be beneficial to human health. They lower the chance of getting heart disease and can control the symptoms of conditions that involve inflammation such as arthritis. The main food source of EPA and DHA is fatty fish like salmon and sardines. EPA and DHA are also found in fish oil supplements. The UK government recommends that people consume EPA and DHA regularly in order to stay healthy, particularly during ageing. However, many people do not follow these recommendations, partly because they do not like to eat fatty fish or find it too expensive. Also, there are not enough fish in in the sea to provide everyone in the world with enough EPA and DHA to stay healthy, and fish stocks are declining. Therefore, there is a need to find a sustainable source of EPA and DHA that can be increased in order to meet the need for these healthy fats. Research sponsored by the BBSRC has led to the development of plants that can make EPA and DHA. This has been achieved by inserting the genes needed for making EPA and DHA into plants that do not normally have those genes. The oil produced in the seeds of these so-called transgenic plants contains similar amounts of EPA and DHA to fish oils. Therefore, it is possible that this seed oil could be used to replace fatty fish and fish oil supplements as a sustainable and inexpensive source of EPA and DHA. However, the structure of the oil produced by the plants is different from that of fish oils, and it is not known whether this difference would result in the plant oil being a better or worse source of EPA and DHA for people. It is important to know this, because if the plant oil was less effective than fish oil in increasing the amount of EPA and DHA in people's blood and tissues, and in benefiting health, then it may be less attractive as a source of EPA and DHA in the diet. This project will determine whether the plant oil is as effective as fish oil in changing the amounts of EPA and DHA in the blood and in modifying some processes that are related to health. In the latter regard, we plan to study the concentrations of fats like cholesterol in the blood and the ability of immune cells taken from the blood to respond when stimulated in the laboratory. We will address our aims in two ways. First, we will recruit healthy men and women in two age groups (18 to 30 years or 50 to 65 years) to take part in a study that involves consuming a single meal containing either fish oil or new plant oil. We will then take a series of blood samples over the following 8 hours. This will allow us to assess whether EPA and DHA derived from the plant oil are absorbed as efficiently by the gut as when they are provided as fish oil. We will also compare the effect of the two oils on the levels of fat and on substances involved in immune function in blood. Second, we will recruit another group of healthy volunteers as above, and provide them with fish oil or plant oil as a dietary supplement to take over 8 weeks. We will take blood samples after 4 and 8 weeks and compare the effect of the different oils on the levels of EPA and DHA in blood and in blood cells. We will also compare the effect of these oils on immune function, the levels of fat in blood, and on the activity of genes in white blood cells. The findings will show whether the plant oil is as effective as fish oil in raising the levels of EPA and DHA in blood and in changing immune function. We expect that the findings of this project will provide strong evidence for or against using the plant oil as a replacement for fish oil. Furthermore, these results will contribute to the continuing debate about the introduction of transgenic crops into agricultural practice. Ultimately, we hope that a positive outcome will lead to the use of the plant oil as a major source of EPA and DHA in the UK diet as this would have important positive implications for marine ecology and for health of the UK population.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,BB/N014081/1,,,,,,,,University of Southampton,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15372193,,

Wave energy has a high energy density, high utilization time and no fuel costs, so it is considered as the most promising alternative to the fossil fuel resources. The number of studies of wave energy converters (WECs) has rapidly increased. This paper proposes a new method to achieve the resonant behavior of a point absorber floating buoy type of WEC using a mechanical power take-off system. By using the inertia characteristics of a hydraulic flywheel accumulator-based electro-hydraulic actuator to change the corresponding supplementary mass of the floating buoy, the total mass of the buoy was close to a match with the relatively low frequency of the wave, so that the buoy was in resonance with the wave. The specifications of the hydraulic flywheel accumulator system were proposed and studied. The working principle was analyzed, and a mathematical model was then derived to investigate the system operation. An experimental set-up was implemented to validate the mathematical model.

It observes solar radiation at medium to high spectral resolution (better than 0.3 nm), which has been reflected by the Earth's surface using similar methods to those used by polar-orbiting satellites such as the JAXA GOSAT mission, NASA's OCO-2, and the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor. By using an original design comprising optical fibre inputs along with a single diffraction grating and detector array, GHOST is able to observe CO2 absorption bands centred around 1.61 and 2.06 mu m (the same wavelength regions used by OCO-2 and GOSAT) whilst simultaneously measuring CH4 absorption at 1.65 mu m (also observed by GOSAT) and CH4 and CO at 2.30 mu m (observed by Sentinel-5P). With emissions expected to become more concentrated towards city sources as the global population residing in urban areas increases, there emerges a clear requirement to bridge the spatial scale gap between small-scale urban emission sources and global-scale GHG variations. In addition to the benefits achieved in spatial coverage through being able to remotely sense GHG tropospheric columns from an aircraft, the overlapping spectral ranges and comparable spectral resolutions mean that GHOST has unique potential for providing validation opportunities for these platforms, particularly over the ocean, where ground-based validation measurements are not available. In this paper we provide an overview of the GHOST instrument, calibration, and data processing, demonstrating the instrument's performance and suitability for GHG remote sensing.

The combination of qualitative and quantitative interpretation reduces ambiguities in the estimation and identification of gas hydrate. Sandy deposition and faults are qualitatively interpreted from amplitude data. The 3D acoustic impedance volume was interpreted in terms of high P-impedance hydrate zones and low P-impedance free gas zones. Gas hydrate saturation derived from P-impedance is estimated by a rock physics transform. We interpreted gas hydrate in the sand-prone sediments with a maximum saturation of approximately 50% of the pore space. Sheet-like and some bright spot gas hydrate accumulations are interpreted. The interpretation of sheet-like gas hydrate within sand-prone sediments around faults suggests that fluid moves into the sand zones laterally by conduits. Variations in depths of interpreted gas hydrate zones imply nonequilibrium conditions. Low P-impedance free gas zones within high P-impedance gas hydrate zones imply possible coexistence of hydrate and free gas within the hydrate stability zone.

J,,,,,,,,,Johnathan Napier,,Can oils derived from genetically-modified plants replace fish oil as a source of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the human diet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2016,2016,"Omega-3 fats called EPA and DHA are known to be beneficial to human health. They lower the chance of getting heart disease and can control the symptoms of conditions that involve inflammation such as arthritis. The main food source of EPA and DHA is fatty fish like salmon and sardines. EPA and DHA are also found in fish oil supplements. The UK government recommends that people consume EPA and DHA regularly in order to stay healthy, particularly during ageing. However, many people do not follow these recommendations, partly because they do not like to eat fatty fish or find it too expensive. Also, there are not enough fish in in the sea to provide everyone in the world with enough EPA and DHA to stay healthy, and fish stocks are declining. Therefore, there is a need to find a sustainable source of EPA and DHA that can be increased in order to meet the need for these healthy fats. Research sponsored by the BBSRC has led to the development of plants that can make EPA and DHA. This has been achieved by inserting the genes needed for making EPA and DHA into plants that do not normally have those genes. The oil produced in the seeds of these so-called transgenic plants contains similar amounts of EPA and DHA to fish oils. Therefore, it is possible that this seed oil could be used to replace fatty fish and fish oil supplements as a sustainable and inexpensive source of EPA and DHA. However, the structure of the oil produced by the plants is different from that of fish oils, and it is not known whether this difference would result in the plant oil being a better or worse source of EPA and DHA for people. It is important to know this, because if the plant oil was less effective than fish oil in increasing the amount of EPA and DHA in people's blood and tissues, and in benefiting health, then it may be less attractive as a source of EPA and DHA in the diet. This project will determine whether the plant oil is as effective as fish oil in changing the amounts of EPA and DHA in the blood and in modifying some processes that are related to health. In the latter regard, we plan to study the concentrations of fats like cholesterol in the blood and the ability of immune cells taken from the blood to respond when stimulated in the laboratory. We will address our aims in two ways. First, we will recruit healthy men and women in two age groups (18 to 30 years or 50 to 65 years) to take part in a study that involves consuming a single meal containing either fish oil or new plant oil. We will then take a series of blood samples over the following 8 hours. This will allow us to assess whether EPA and DHA derived from the plant oil are absorbed as efficiently by the gut as when they are provided as fish oil. We will also compare the effect of the two oils on the levels of fat and on substances involved in immune function in blood. Second, we will recruit another group of healthy volunteers as above, and provide them with fish oil or plant oil as a dietary supplement to take over 8 weeks. We will take blood samples after 4 and 8 weeks and compare the effect of the different oils on the levels of EPA and DHA in blood and in blood cells. We will also compare the effect of these oils on immune function, the levels of fat in blood, and on the activity of genes in white blood cells.

Numerical experiments were conducted for the March 1998 and 1999 plume events. The comparison between modeling results of these 2 years shows that the spatial distributions of the biological fields (i.e., phosphorus, phytoplankton, detritus, etc.) were closely coupled to the physical environment associated with wind-induced three-dimensional circulation and mixing. The influence of suspended sediment plumes on the lake ecosystem was reflected in heterotrophic (secondary) production rather than in the autotrophic (primary) production. Nutrients were maintained through nutrient release from suspended sediments within the plume, while it was supplied by current advection and diffusion in the interior. The cross-shore flux of nutrients was driven by episodic wind events with a period of about 5-7 days. The flux was offshore during northerly winds and onshore during southerly winds. Comparisons between energy fluxes among biological variables suggest that the microbial loop (detritus-heterotrophic bacteria and microzooplankton) played an important role in the ecosystem dynamics during plume events. Bacteria were good competitors with phytoplankton for inorganic phosphorus and were also a key supporter for growth of microzooplankton inside and outside the plume. As a result, the lower food web system could be divided into two decoupled loops: (1) detritus-bacteria-microzooplankton-large zooplankton and (2) nutrient-phytoplankton-detritus.",,,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,15,0,32,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Geol Engn & Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USANOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USAUniv Michigan, Dept Naval Architecture & Marine Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USANOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, Lake Michigan Field Stn, Muskegon, MI 49441 USAUniv Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USAUniv Massachusetts Dartmouth, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, New Bedford, MA 02744 USA",,,,2004-07-21,WOS:000222917200001,,

This study is focused on marine Longmaxi and lacustrine Da'anzhai shales in the Upper Yangtze Platform, and their pore structure characteristics were compared and the mechanism of shale gas occurrence were discussed. First, the pore structures of marine and lacustrine shales were characterized and the effects of organic matter abundance, maturity and inorganic minerals on porosity were investigated. Then the contributions of different components to porosity were evaluated and the occurrence mode of methane in the pores of marine and lacustrine shales was established. The results show that (1) Three pore types can be observed in both marine and lacustrine shales: organic matter-hosted pores (OM pores), framework minerals-associated pores (FM pores), and clay minerals-associated pores (CM pores). OM pores are more developed in marine shale and CM pores are more developed in lacustrine shale. (2) Low pressure gas adsorption (LPGA) results show that the micropores of marine shale are dominated by pores of 0.4-0.7 nm and the micropores of lacustrine shale are dominated by pores of 0.5-0.9 nm, while the mesopores of marine shale are dominated by pores of 2-10 nm and the mesopores of lacustrine shale are dominated by pores of 3-30 nm, which are consistent with MIP results. (3) Organic matter has an impact on porosity of marine and continental shales but is not the most important controlling factor. And the contribution of organic matter to porosity in marine shale is greater than the contribution of organic matter to porosity in lacustrine shale. Shale porosity increases first and then decreases with the increase of maturity, which may be related to the carbonization of organic matter. (4) OM pores and CM pores tend to be preserved due to the presence of rigid grains that form rigid frameworks preventing these pores from collapsing. FM pores are mainly related to the dissolution of framework minerals by organic acids, and these dissolution pores can greatly improve the porosity and permeability of shale. (5) Quantification of porosity as related to mineralogy shows that OM pores contribute approximately 37% to total porosity of marine shale and 24% to total porosity of lacustrine shale and CM pores contribute approximately 53% to total porosity of marine shale and 67% to total porosity of lacustrine shale. (6) Shale gas occurrence is mainly controlled by the distribution mode of pore systems which are composed of OM pores, FM pores and CM pores. It is due to higher percentage on OM pores and lower percentage on CM pores that gas content of marine shale is generally higher than that of lacustrine shale.",,,,,,,,,87,18,0,0,2,0,98,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Petr, State Key Lab Petr Resources & Prospecting, Beijing 102249, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Petr, Unconvent Oil & Gas Cooperat Innovat Ctr, Beijing 102249, Peoples R ChinaUniv Utah, Energy & Geosci Inst, Salt Lake City, UT 84108 USANortheast Petr Univ, Inst Unconvent Oil & Gas, Daqing 163318, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Petr, Sch Geosci, Qingdao 266580, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaCent S Univ, Sch Geosci & Infophys, Changsha 410012, Hunan, Peoples R China",,,,2019-06-14,WOS:000469157400013,,

To overcome this limitation, we used the Google Earth Engine platform to perform oil palm classification based on Landsat reflectance data. The spatial distribution of oil palms in Malaysia in five periods from 2000 to 2018 was obtained. Then, the planting center of gravity transfer method was applied to analyze the expansion of oil palms in Malaysia from 2000 to 2018 using Landsat data, elevation data, oil palm planting area, crude palm oil price, and other statistical data. Meanwhile, the driving factors affecting the change in oil palm planting area were also analyzed. The results showed that: (1) During 2000-2018, the oil palm planted area in Malaysia increased by 5.06 Mha (million ha), with a growth rate of 83.50%. Specifically, the increased area and growth rate for West Malaysia were 2.05 Mha and 62.05% and for East Malaysia were 3.01 Mha and 109.45%, respectively.

Increasing temperatures worldwide have been blamed for numerous negative impacts on agriculture, weather, forestry, marine ecosystems, and human health. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that the primary GHG emitted in the U.S. is carbon dioxide (CO2) most of which stems from fossil fuel combustion [1]. In fact, CO2 represents approximately 85% of all GHG emissions nationwide. The other primary GHGs include nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), ozone (O-3), and fluorinated gases.Since the energy sector is responsible for a majority of the GHGs released into the atmosphere, policies that address their mitigation through the production of electricity using renewable fuels and distributed generation are of significant interest. Use of renewable fuels and clean technologies to meet energy demand instead of relying on traditional electrical grid systems is expected to result in fewer CO2 and CH4 emissions, hence reducing global climate change impacts. Technologies considered cleaner include photovoltaics, wind turbines, and combined heat and power (CHP) devices using microturbines or internal combustion engines. The Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) in California [2] provides incentives for the installation of these technologies under certain circumstances.This paper assesses the GHG emission impacts from California's SGIP during the 2005 program year by estimating the reductions in CO2 and CH4 released when SGIP projects are in operation. Our analysis focuses on these emissions since these are the two GHGs characteristic of SGIP projects. Results of this analysis show that emissions of GHGs are reduced due to the SGIP. This is because projects operating under this program reduce reliance on electricity generated by conventional power plants and - encourage the use of renewable fuels, such as captured waste heat and methane.",,,,,ASME Power Conference 2007ASME Power Conference 2007,"JUL 17-19, 2007JUL 17-19, 2007","ASME, Power DivASME, Power Div","San Antonio, TXSan Antonio, TX",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4273-7,,,,,,,,,"Itron Inc, Spokane, WA 99216 USA",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000250717400055,,

In some cases, the main direction is also considered. Nevertheless, definition of the whole storm history, including the variation of the main random variables during the storm cycle is not taken into consideration.The representativeness of the proposed storm models, analysed in a recent study using an empirical maximum energy flux time dependent function shows that the behaviour of the different storm models is extremely dependent on the climatic characteristics of the project area. Moreover, there are no theoretical models able to adequately reproduce storm history evolution of the sea states characterized by important swell components.To overcome this shortcoming, several theoretical storm shapes are investigated taking into consideration the bases of the three best theoretical storm models, the Equivalent Magnitude Storm (EMS), the Equivalent Number of Waves Storm (ENWS) and the Equivalent Duration Storm (EDS) models. To analyse the representativeness of the new storm shape, the aforementioned maximum energy flux formulation and a wave overtopping discharge structure function are used.With the empirical energy flux formulation, correctness of the different approaches is focussed on the progressive hydraulic stability loss of the main armour layer caused by real and theoretical storms. For the overtopping structure equation, the total volume of discharge is considered. In all cases, the results obtained highlight the greater representativeness of the triangular EMS model for sea waves and the trapezoidal (nonparallel sides) EMS model for waves with a higher degree of wave development.Taking into account the increase in offshore and shallow water wind turbines, maritime transport and deep vertical breakwaters, the maximum wave height of the whole storm history and that corresponding to each sea state belonging to its cycle's evolution is also considered. The procedure considers the information usually available for extreme waves' characterization. Extrapolations of the maximum wave height of the selected storms have also been considered. The 4th order statistics of the sea state belonging to the real and theoretical storm have been estimated to complete the statistical analysis of individual wave height. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents preliminary results from a 3D model for simulating the growth of carbonate platforms,focusing especially on the behavior of platform-margin facies tracts. The 3D model, described here for the first time, was used to investigate the impact of changing sea level on the growth of carbonate platforms, using a range of initial seafloor gradients. The initial depositional surface used in the model features an along-strike transition from gently dipping to more steeply dipping profiles, Simulations were performed to investigate different aspects of platform growth in response to a single cycle of sea-level change (200-meter amplitude, 200,000 yr cycle duration). Using low (similar to 1 degrees) initial gradients, the model produces a complex depositional unit that consists of several detached platform-margin 'terraces,' each of which has a relatively low-relief final profile. Following the full cycle of sea-level change, the final depositional unit contains highly diachronous facies boundaries with significant facies dislocations. In contrast, using the same sea-level oscillation, but a steeper (similar to 160) initial depositional gradient, the model creates a narrower platform, with a terminal depositional profile that is steeper overall. Internal chronostratigraphic relationships within the final depositional unit are also complex, although facies dislocations are more areally limited than in the low-gradient example.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0144-5987,,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,,,1999-01-01,WOS:000084174300009,,

Cleanup personnel have recognized that remote sensing can increase spill cleanup efficiency. It has long been recognized that there is no one sensor which is capable of detecting oil and related petroleum products in all environments and spill scenarios, There are sensors which possess a wide field-of-view and can therefore be used to map the overall extent of the spill. These sensors, however lack the capability to positively identify oil and related products, especially along complicated beach and shoreline environments where several substrates are present.The laser-based sensors under development by the Emergencies Science Division of Environment Canada are designed to fill specific roles in oil spill response. The Scanning Laser Environmental Airborne Fluorosensor (SLEAF) is being developed to detect and map oil and related petroleum products in complex marine and shoreline environments where other non-specific sensors experience difficulty. The role of the SLEAF would be to confirm or reject suspected oil contamination sites that have been targeted by the non-specific sensors. This confirmation will release response crews from the time-consuming task of physically inspecting each site, and direct crews to sites that require remediation. The Laser Ultrasonic Remote Sensing of Oil Thickness (LURSOT) sensor will provide an absolute measurement of oil thickness from an airborne platform. There are presently no sensors available, either airborne or in the laboratory which can provide an absolute measurement of oil thickness. This information is necessary for the effective direction of spill countermeasures such as dispersant application and in-situ burning.This paper will describe the development of laser-based airborne oil spill remote sensing instrumentation at Environment Canada and identify the anticipated benefits of the use of this technology to the oil spill response community.",,,,,Conference on Advances in Laser Remote Sensing for Terrestrial and Oceanographic ApplicationsConference on Advances in Laser Remote Sensing for Terrestrial and Oceanographic Applications,"APR 21-22, 1997APR 21-22, 1997",Soc Photo Opt Instrumentat EngineersSoc Photo Opt Instrumentat Engineers,"ORLANDO, FLORLANDO, FL",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,0-8194-2474-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,1997-01-01,WOS:A1997BJ21X00012,,

J,,,,,,,,,Russell Wynn,,"How do submarine landslides disintegrate and form long run-out turbidity currents in the deep ocean, and how erosive are these flows?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 06 2013,2013,"Submarine landslides are a common geological feature in the deep ocean. They occur in a range of environments, from steep volcanic island flanks to areas of gently sloping sediment-covered open slope. Some submarine landslides disintegrate during their passage downslope and transform into sediment-gravity flows that can transport huge volumes of sediment for hundreds of kilometres over relatively flat ocean floor (<1o). Submarine landslides and sediment-gravity flows are the dominant process for global sediment transport from the continental shelf to the deep ocean, and are a major threat to an increasing worldwide network of seafloor infrastructure, e.g. oil/gas pipelines and telecommunications cables. Submarine landslides can also generate catastrophic tsunamis. For example, the giant Storegga Slide offshore Norway about 8200 years ago produced a tsunami that devastated coastal communities from Norway to Scotland. In addition, the deposits of sand-rich flows form many of the World's largest oil and gas reservoirs, while mud-rich flows may sequester globally significant volumes of organic carbon in the deep ocean. Improving our understanding of landslide and sediment-gravity flow hazards requires field data from past events; these data provide insights into important parameters such as volume and recurrence interval. These data also help us to model landslide-generated tsunamis and assess the associated risks.In this study we propose to generate the first ever field dataset tracing a large-scale submarine landslide and its associated sediment-gravity flow from source-to-sink. We will focus on the Moroccan Turbidite System offshore NW Africa, where the World's largest sediment-gravity flows were able to transport >100 km3 of sediment across distances up to 2000 km. The volume, source area and timing of several geologically recent (last 200,000 years) flows has been identified, using a dataset of >200 shallow sediment cores collected from across the entire depositional area over the last 30 years. Previous work has shown that most of these flows originated from (as yet unmapped) landslides in and around upper Agadir Canyon, which is one of the largest canyons in the World at 450 km long, up to 30 km wide and 1250 m deep. Most of upper Agadir Canyon above 4000 m water depth is unexplored, so we plan to map and sample landslides in this area using geophysical tools and sediment corers. The new results will allow us to undertake a novel 'mass balance' analysis, where we can quantify 1) the volume of material evacuated during the initial landslide, 2) the rate and extent of disintegration of failed material, 3) the volume of material removed by the resulting flow, and 4) the volume of eroded seafloor sediment incorporated in the flow. This unique quantitative field dataset will allow us to tackle three important science questions:1) How quickly do large submarine landslides disintegrate into long run-out sediment flows, and how is this process influenced by shape of the slope?2) How efficiently do landslides remove failed material, i.e. what proportion of landslide debris is deposited on the slope and how much transforms into a flow that is transported distally?3) How much sediment is incorporated into the flow through seafloor erosion, and where does most of this erosion take place?The results will be vital for ongoing landslide-tsunami and sediment gravity-flow modeling being undertaken by NOC and others in the NERC community, and will improve assessment of associated global geohazards.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/J012955/1,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15384967,,

Evaporation is the key component of the Dead Sea water budget and accounts for the main loss of water. So far, lake evaporation has been determined by indirect methods only and not measured directly. Consequently, the governing factors of evaporation are unknown. For the first time, long-term eddy covariance measurements were performed at the western Dead Sea shore for a period of 1 year by implementing a new concept for onshore lake evaporation measurements. To account for lake evaporation during offshore wind conditions, a robust and reliable multiple regression model was developed using the identified governing factors wind velocity and water vapour pressure deficit. An overall regression coefficient of 0.8 is achieved. The measurements show that the diurnal evaporation cycle is governed by three local wind systems: a lake breeze during daytime, strong downslope winds in the evening, and strong northerly along-valley flows during the night. After sunset, the strong winds cause half-hourly evaporation rates which are up to 100% higher than during daytime. The median daily evaporation is 4.3 mm d(-1) in July and 1.1 mm d(-1) in December. The annual evaporation of the water surface at the measurement location was 994 +/- 88 mm a(-1) from March 2014 until March 2015. Furthermore, the performance of indirect evaporation approaches was tested and compared to the measurements. The aerodynamic approach is applicable for subdaily and multi-day calculations and attains correlation coefficients between 0.85 and 0.99. For the application of the Bowen ratio energy budget method and the Priestley-Taylor method, measurements of the heat storage term are inevitable on timescales up to 1 month. Otherwise strong seasonal biases occur. The Penman equation was adapted to calculate realistic evaporation, by using an empirically gained linear function for the heat storage term, achieving correlation coefficients between 0.92 and 0.97. In summary, this study introduces a new approach to measure lake evaporation with a station located at the shoreline, which is also transferable to other lakes. It provides the first directly measured Dead Sea evaporation rates as well as applicable methods for evaporation calculation. The first one enables us to further close the Dead Sea water budget, and the latter one enables us to facilitate water management in the region.",,,,,,,,,29,3,0,0,9,0,33,,,1027-5606,1607-7938,,,,,,,,,,"KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, POB 3640, D-76021 Karlsruhe, GermanyBerg Univ Wuppertal, Fak Math & Nat Wissensch, Phys & Theoret Chem, D-42097 Wuppertal, Germany",,,,2018-02-09,WOS:000424705400002,,

All the mud volcanoes and diapirs addressed in this paper lie in the region of olistostrome/accretionary complex units which were emplaced in the Late Miocene in response to NW-directed convergence between the African and Eurasian plates. The study area was investigated by multibeam echo-sounder, high and ultra-high resolution seismic profiling, dredging and coring. The structures observed on multibeam bathymetry, at water depths between 500 and 1300 in, are dominated by elongate mud ridges, mud cones, mud volcanoes and crater-like collapse structures ranging in relief from 50 to 300 in and size from 0.8 to 2 km in diameter. The main morphotectonic features, named the Guadalquivir Diapiric Ridge (GDR) and the Cadiz Diapiric Ridge (CDR), are longitudinally shaped diapirs which trend NE-SW and consist of lower-middle Miocene plastic marly clays. The GDR field and the TASYO field, which consist of mud volcanoes and extensive fluid venting related to diapiric ridge development, are described in this paper. The GDR field is characterised by numerous, single, sub-circular mud volcanoes and mud cones. The single mud volcanoes are cone-shaped features with relatively gentle slopes of 3degrees-6degrees, consisting of several generations of mud breccia deposition with indications of gas-saturation, degassing structures and the presence of H2S. The mud cones have asymmetric profiles with steep slopes of up to 25degrees and contain large surficial deposits of hydrocarbon-derived carbonate chimneys and slabs. The TASYO field is characterised by an extensive concentration of small, sub-circular depressions, oval and multi-cone mud volcanoes and large sediment slides. Mud volcanoes in this area are characterised by moderate slopes (8degrees-12degrees), have bathymetric relief ranging from 100 to 190 in and consist of sulphide-rich mud breccia, calcite chimneys, carbonate crusts and chemosynthetic fauna (Pogonophora tube worms). We propose that all these hydrocarbon seepage structures are related to lateral compressional stress generated at the front of the olistostromic/accretionary wedge. This stress results in the uplifting and squeezing plastic marly clay deposits. Additionally, the compressional stress at the toe of the olistostrome forms overpressurised compartments which provide avenues for hydrocarbon-enriched fluids to migrate.

The aim of this work is to assess the effect of currents on the functioning of the oyster-mussel farm, as well as to clarify the information about the currents in the mariculture area. To measure the speed and direction of the currents, freely drifting landmarks with different depths of the damper were used. The coordinates of the tracers were recorded using the GPS receiver Garmin 72 H. All in all for the period 2014-2016 17 launches were conducted. In addition, the speed and direction of the wind in the vicinity of the farm were studied. It was found that the average currents velocity in the region of the truss at the surface was 11 cm-s(-1), at depths of 6 and 10 m(-3) cm-s(-1). The absolute values of the current velocity varied from 0.3 to 23.0 cm-s(-1) at all horizons. Directions of currents on the surface coincided with the direction of the wind, in rare cases, minor deviations of the currents were observed due to the influence of the shoreline and the bottom. Compensatory counterflows are noted in the near-bottom horizons of the Karantinnaya Bay. Dominant directions of currents were determined, using the rose of the frequency of local wind directions. The most frequent directions of the currents on the farm were from the open sea (southern, south-eastern and eastern points) and the Karantinnaya Bay (northern and northeastern points). Currents of the western and south-western direction, carrying water from the Sevastopol Bay, were more rare. Almost no current of north-western direction was observed.

This variability is especially marked over the coastal strip due to the diurnal solar radiation cycle and to the existence of a generic phenomenon known as coastal lows.Based on weather charts (Reanalysis) together with surface and upper-air data obtained during the CIMAR 6 cruise, the effect of synoptic-scale variability on the stratocumulus within the marine boundary layer and the inversion layer above it, is documented and discussed. This variability was outstanding during the first half of CIMAR 6, due to the projection of mid-latitude disturbances over the subtropical sector of the southeastern Pacific. The amplitude of these disturbances was more pronounced over the coastal strip, possibly in connection With enhanced up and down flows by the Andes. The warm easterlies and the descent of the subsidence inversion associated with the onset of upper-air ridges that followed those disturbances, extended as far as 800 km offshore, though winds in a shallow surface layer maintained the south (equatorward) direction. It can be concluded that, at a local level, there is no simple relationship between large scale subsidence and depth of the marine boundary layer, probably due to the warm advection produced by the easterlies as they flow down the Andes slope.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,2,3,,,0716-2006,0718-0969,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Chile, Dept Geofis, Blanco Encalada, Santiago 2002, Chile",,,,2006-01-01,BCI:BCI200700214153,,

The subsea pipeline is subject to considerable loads ranging from hydrodynamics forces from the sea current to seabed contact forces. Those contact forces are very important in risers design life, since high and concentrated bending moment stresses are observed in the region where the pipeline starts to be supported by the seafloor. The proper representation of the soil behavior in contact with the structure comprises a very important topic of study in subsea pipelines. In this context, a consistent pipeline-seabed interaction model based on Kerr-type foundation is presented. A finite element formulation for the soil, where the stiffness matrix is derived from a variational formulation of a three parameter elastic foundation model, is proposed. The pipeline is modeled as a planar beam undergoing large displacements using a co-rotational approach. The unilateral contact between soil and pipeline is dealt with a step-loading procedure. The proposed model is able to solve problems where the pipeline is initially placed above the foundation surface and subsequent contact with the seafloor is induced by large displacement of the structure. Numerical examples are presented in order to validate the foundation formulation and explore the proposed contact solution between a pipeline and the seabed.

Sea water covers two-thirds of the earth surface, so using this source to provide potable water is logical and should be an important component to solve the water shortage problem. Additionally, technologies exist to treat waste water to meet specific water quality requirements thus its reuse should also be fully explored to address the water shortage issue. Among different methods employed for desalination and waste water treatment/reuse, pressure driven membrane technologies are very common, in which undesirable constituents in water were rejected by a selective membrane barrier. Thereby, it is very important to study and develop membranes with highest separation and operation performance for the application.Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are materials of wide interests in recent years because of their interesting chemistry and potential applications. In separation science, researchers have extensively explored the use of MOFs for gas separation and water treatment. In this review paper, we plan to examine the usage of MOFs for the membrane desalination and water treatment, a relatively narrow but increasingly important area of MOFs applications. Following a short introduction about MOFs, we would present several methods to prepare MOFs membranes, various desalination techniques and the ways of MOFs application, and finally, MOF membranes in terms of their contributions to water filtration applications such as desalination, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration. The use of MOFs in water treatment membranes is still in its infancy when compared with its applications for gas separation. Due to their structure and properties, however, MOFs had already demonstrated some amazing results enhancing membranes performance. With this review, the first on the topic to our knowledge, the purpose was to further stimulate the development and use of MOFs in water separation membranes and desalination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this sense, this work aims to use the power of artificial neural networks (ANN) to recognize the different incoming waves in order to distinguish the strong waves that provoke the stalling behavior and generate a suitable airflow speed reference for the airflow control scheme. The ANN is, therefore, trained using real surface elevation measurements of the waves. The ANN-based airflow control will control an air valve in the capture chamber to adjust the airflow speed as required. A comparative study has been carried out to compare the ANN-based airflow control to the uncontrolled OWC system in different sea conditions.

The Consequences of climatic perturbations and associated changes on the evolution of carbonate platforms are relatively unexplored. Today, modern carbonate platforms, especially coral reefs are highly sensitive to environmental and climatic change, which raises the question how (sub)tropica I reef systems of the early Paleogene reacted to gradual and Sudden global warming, eutrophication of shelf areas, enhanced CO2 levels in an ocean with low Mg/Ca ratios. The answer to this question may help to investigate the fate of modern coral reef systems in times of global warming and rising CO2 levels.Here we present a synthesis of Tethyan carbonate platform evolution in the early Paleogene (similar to 59-55 Ma) concentrating on coral reefs and larger foraminifera, two important organism groups during this time interval. We discuss and evaluate the importance of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors leading to the dissimilar evolution of both groups during the early Paleogene. Detailed analyses of two carbonate platform areas at low (Egypt) and middle (Spain) paleolatitudes and comparison with faunal patterns of coeval platforms retrieved from the literature led to the distinction of three evolutionary stages in the late Paleocene to early Eocene Tethys: Stage I, late Paleocene coralgal-dominated platforms at low to middle paleolatitudes: stage II, a transitional latest Paleocene platform stage with coralgal reefs dominating at middle paleolatitudes and larger foraminifera-dominated (Miscellanea, Ranikothalia, Assilina) platforms at low paleolatitudes: and stage III, early Eocene larger foraminifera-dominated (Alveolina, Orbitolites, Nummulites) platforms at low to middle paleolatitudes, The onset of the latter prominent larger foraminifera-dominated platform correlates with the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum.The Causes for the change from coral-dominated platforms to larger foraminifera-dominated platforms are multilayered. The decline of coralgal reefs in low latitudes during platform stage II is related to overall warming, leading to sea-surface temperatures in the tropics beyond the maximum temperature range of corals. The overall low Occurrence of coral reefs in the Paleogene might be related to the presence of a calcite sea. At the same time larger foraminifera started to flourish after their near extinction at the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. The demise of coralgal reefs at all studied paleolatitudes in platform stage III can be founded oil the effects of the PETM, resulting in short-term warming, eutrophic conditions on the shelves and acidification of the oceans, hampering the growth of aragonitic corals, while calcitic larger foraminifera flourished. In the absence of other successful carbon ate-producing organisms, larger foraminifera were able to take over the role as the dominant carbonate platform inhabitant, leading to a stepwise Tethyan platform stage evolution around the Paleocene/Eocene boundary. This szenario might be also effective for threatened coral reef sites. (C) 2008 Elsevier BY.

Capsaicin was first dissolved in one of the three organic solvents, methanol, ethanol, and acetone. The organic solvent was replaced by gradually adding distilled water and evaporating the organic solvent.Results. The best solvent for obtaining highest concentration of capsaicin in water was ethanol. A maximum capsaicin in water 6400 ppm was achieved by using 16 mg capsaicin dissolved in 0.8 ml ethanol followed with the addition of 2.5 ml distilled water in 0.2 ml increments and then slow evaporation of the solvent.Conclusion.

Crater-like depressions, incised valleys, and large but inactive pockmarks also indicate methane activities over the spur and knoll. These features imply strong expulsions of methane gas or methane-bearing fluids, and perhaps lifting and floating-up of large volumes of methane hydrate to the sea surface.High heat flow, similar to 100 mK/m, deposition of organic-rich strata, similar to 1.0 to 1.5% TOC, and Pliocene-Quaternary inversion-tectonics along the eastern margin of the Japan Sea facilitate thermal maturation of organic matters, and generation and migration of light-hydrocarbons through fault conduits, and accumulation of large volumes of methane as methane hydrate in shallow sediments. Microbial methane generation has also contributed to reinforcing the methane flux of the Joetsu basin. Regional methane flux as observed by the depth of the sulfate-methane interface(SMI) is significantly high, < 1 m to 3 m, when compared to classic gas hydrate fields of Blake Ridge, 15 to 20 m, and Nankai trough, 3 to 15 m. delta C-13 of methane hydrate and seep gases are mostly within -30 to -50%, the range of thermogenic methane, while dissolved methane of the interstitial waters a few kilometers away from seep sites are predominated by microbial with delta C-13 of -50 to -100%.Seismic profiles have revealed fault-related, well-developed gas chimney structures, 0.2 to 3.5 km in diameter, on the spur and knoll. The structures are essential for conveying methane from deep-seated sources to shallow depths as well as for accumulating methane hydrate (gas chimney type deposits). The depth of BSR, which represents the base of gas hydrate stability (BGHS), on the spur and knoll is generally 0.20 to 0.23 seconds in two-way-travel time, whereas the BSRs in gas chimneys occur at 0.14 to 0.18 seconds, exhibiting a sharp pull-up structure. The apparent shallow BGHS is due to the accumulation of large volumes of high-velocity methane hydrate in gas chimneys.The depth to BGHS is estimated to be 115 m on an experimentally determined stability diagram, based on an observed thermal gradient of 100 mK/m. Then the velocity of the sediments on the Umitaka spur is calculated to be 1000 m/s, which is anomalously low compared to normal pelagic mud of 1600. 1700 m/s. This exciting finding leads to the important implication that sediments of the Umitaka spur contain significant amounts of free gas, although the sediments are well within the stability field of methane hydrate. The reasons for the existence of free gas in the methane hydrate stability field are not fully explained, but we propose the following possible mechanisms for the unusual co-existence of methane hydrate and free-gas in clay-silt of the spur. (i) High salinity effect of residual waters,(ii) degassing from ascending fluids,(iii) bound water effect and deficiency of free-waters, and(iv) micro-pore effect of porous media. All of these processes relate to the development of gas hydrate deposits of the Umitaka spur.Increased accumulation of methane hydrate(specific gravity similar to 0.91 g/cm(3)) in shallow sediments should have caused a gravity imbalance of methane hydrate bearing sediments, and eventually the methane hydrate blocks lifted and floated up to the sea surface(auto-collapse). Crater-like depressions and valleys are the heritage of such an auto-collapse process.Dark colored, thinly laminated units with a very low abundance of benthic foraminifers occur in 27 to 18 kyrBP, approximately the period of the LGM, indicating low-oxygen, euxinic conditions. Furthermore, delta C-13 of benthic foraminifers from the dark laminated unit exhibits sharp negative excursion toward similar to 21 kyrBP. A sea-level fall of similar to 120 m toward the LGM released the pressure of gas hydrate-bearing sediments, and presumably triggered the dissociation of subsurface methane hydrate, which, in turn, destabilized the entire gas chimney hydrate system, collapsing the gas chimney and leaving large and deep pockmarks.",,,,,,,,,42,1,0,0,6,0,42,,,0022-135X,1884-0884,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Tokyo, JapanNatl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Tokyo, JapanUniv Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Tokyo, JapanJapan Agcy Marine Sci & Technol, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, JapanJapans Independent Inst Co Ltd, Tokyo, JapanChiba Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Chiba, JapanRice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USATokyo Kasei Gakuin Univ, Tokyo, JapanSugamo Foraminiferal Res Lab, Tokyo, JapanGeoWindow Co Ltd, Tokyo, JapanNatl Res Council Canada, Ottawa, ON, CanadaTokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Sci, Tokyo, Japan",Japans Independent Inst Co LtdTokyo Kasei Gakuin UnivSugamo Foraminiferal Res LabGeoWindow Co Ltd,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000446260000003,,

The seaweed extract enhances the oxidative stability of fish oil-loaded capsules with dextran as the main biopolymer wall material, but shows a prooxidant effect in fish oil-loaded capsules having glucose syrup as the main biopolymer. These results can mainly be explained by the higher encapsulation efficiency of dextran capsules when compared to glucose capsules (90 vs. 83-85%), which prevents interaction of metal ions present in the extract with non-encapsulated oil. On the contrary, the addition of a lipophilic radical scavenger such as delta-tocopherol in combination with synergistic antioxidants such as carnosic acid and carnosol present in rosemary extract improves the oxidative stability of glucose syrup capsules during 21 day storage, but not when the capsules are added to mayonnaise. Moreover, the capsule-containing mayonnaise presents a larger droplet size and higher apparent viscosity than mayonnaise enriched with neat fish oil. Both findings indicate that the structure of capsules may have been lost when added to a water-based food matrix (e.g., mayonnaise) and this requires further investigation.Practical Applications: Novel omega-3 delivery systems that are more easily dispersed and still maintain their oxidative stability are needed by the food industry. Electrosprayed capsules with a reduced size when compared to spray-dried capsules, and which are produced without the need of heat for drying emulsions are promising omega-3 powdered encapsulates. Moreover, the addition of natural antioxidants, commonly used by the industry to further stabilize omega-3 encapsulates, deserves scientific attention. This study reveals the effect of seaweed antioxidants (e.g., phlorotannins) and commercial natural antioxidants (e.g., delta-tocopherol and rosemary extract) on the oxidative stability of electrosprayed capsules loaded with fish oil. In addition, the effect of adding the capsules to a food matrix such as mayonnaise has been investigated. Although further development is necessary, these results will open up new strategies to enrich food products with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,9,0,17,,,1438-7697,1438-9312,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Food Inst, Div Food Technol, DK-2800 Lyngby, DenmarkCSIC, IATA, Novel Mat & Nanotechnol Grp, Valencia 46980, SpainBioinicia SL, Valencia 46980, SpainMatis, IS-113 Reykjavik, IcelandUniv Georgia, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Athens, GA 30602 USA",Bioinicia SLMatis,,,2019-04-12,WOS:000462920600010,,

Chimney structures located in marine areas are prone to corrosion. Regardless of the causing factors, corrosion causes the degradation of the strength of steel bars, creating a detriment to the safety of the chimney structure. A more severe situation is a corroded chimney structure that is subjected to other natural hazards such as strong winds and earthquakes. Very few documented research studies have evaluated the seismic performance of chimney structures under the combined hazards of corrosion and seismic loading. In this study, seismic fragility was used to compute the probability of damage to two corroded chimney structures of differing heights under near-fault ground motions. In the fragility analysis, the uncertainties of materials and ground motions were considered. Based on the numerical simulation results, fragility curves were generated. The results indicated that corrosion had a significant effect on the seismic performance of chimney structures. With an increased corrosion level, the probability of moderate damage, major damage, and collapse increased significantly if the intensity of the ground motion was greater than a threshold value. The threshold value was determined by the corrosion severity. Therefore, it is suggested to inspect the severity of corrosion and adopt measures for reinforcement to minimize the impact of that corrosion on the stability of the chimney, especially in areas susceptible to earthquakes.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,0887-3828,1943-5509,,,,,,,,,,"Yangzhou Univ, Coll Civil Sci & Engn, Yangzhou 225127, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000453216600009,,

It has long been believed that the Terra Nova Bay polynya opens in response to strong offshore katabatic wind forcing. This study shows that not only is the sensible heat flux important in controlling fluctuations in polynya extent, but that the longwave heat fluxes is important also. Moreover, this study shows that wind forcing becomes important to the polynya dynamics as an amplification factor acting on the longwave flux term. Together these two terms can explain up to 40% of the observed variance in open water fraction. Some large-amplitude fluctuations in open water fraction at Terra Nova Bay were not well modeled in this study. These anomalies are believed to be related to large-scale changes in the Ross Sea pack ice, which are driven by strong winds blowing off the Ross Ice Shelf. Ice production rates were found to be comparable with historical estimates.

Methane hydrate is a solid with the appearance of ice, in which water forms a cage-like structure enclosing molecules of methane. Methane hydrate is stable under conditions of low temperature and high pressure such as those found in regions of permafrost or under the ocean in water deeper than 300-600 metres, depending on the water temperature. Over the past thirty years, the ocean's temperature at the seabed has increased by 1 degree C, causing the zone in which hydrate is stable to contract down the continental slope, with the apparent consequence that hydrate has broken down and released methane, which has migrated to the seabed and into the ocean. At present, the rate of release of methane is generally too slow to overcome dissolution and oxidation in the ocean to reach the atmosphere, except in very small quantities. However, catastrophic gas venting, which is known to occur elsewhere, could release large amounts of methane over a short period of time. The strength of such venting depends upon the how much gas is stored locally beneath the seabed and the kinds of pathways that bring gas to the seabed. The proposed research seeks to define these pathways and to quantify the amount of gas. A marine research expedition will use a deep-towed, very high-resolution seismic system to image the small-scale structures that convey gas to the seabed and to detect the presence of gas in the sediments beneath the seabed. This will be done in conjunction with an electromagnetic exploration system that uses a deep-towed transmitter and receivers on the seabed to derive the variations in electrical resistivity in the sediments beneath the seabed. Higher-than-normal resistivity is caused by both gas and hydrate, whereas the presence of gas reduces seismic velocity and hydrate increases it. In combination, the two techniques can distinguish the separate amounts of hydrate and gas. The deep-towed seismic system, SYSIF, which uses a piezo-electric chirp source that gives very-high-resolution images and deeper sub-seabed penetration than similar systems mounted on a ship's hull, will be supplemented by the use of ocean-bottom seismometers to provide precise measurements of the variation of seismic velocity with depth, and seismic profiles with small airgun (mini-GI gun) to provide deeper high-resolution seismic imaging. Multibeam sonar will be used to improve definition of the shape of the seabed and high-frequency, fish-finding sonar will image plumes of gas bubbles and define their positions, providing, in many cases, comparisons with the images obtained in 2008 when they were first discovered. Two areas will be investigated, the region of the landward limit of the methane hydrate stability zone, where many bubble plumes occur in water shallower than 400 metres, and, for comparison, a pockmark in the Vestnesa Ridge, at a depth 1200 metres, from which gas is escaping and is underlain by 'chimneys' that convey gas to the seabed through the hydrate stability zone, where the gas would normally form hydrate. Geological and geophysical data, including 96-channel seismic reflection profiles, acquired in both areas during a research cruise in 2008, will complement the new data.

A special attention was made on the density stratification effects on the liquid side behavior, presuming that its strong dependence on the ocean fluxes of greenhouse gases.Experiments were made for unstable and stably stratified conditions in the water channel flow (0.6mWx0.6mHx10mL) with heat transfer. Turbulent velocity components and temperature were measured by laser Doppler velocimeter and cold wire meth\ods, respectively.It was found that the vertical motions of turbulence near the gas-liquid interface induces extra pressure and then surface waves. As a result, the correlation between vertical velocity fluctuations and temperature or concentration ones becomes zero at the interface and so does the turbulence components of momentum, heat and mass fluxes. However, since the vertical component of turbulent velocity fluctuation is converted into horizontal ones at the interface and so the turbulence intensity remains at high levels, exchange coefficients of heat and mass across the interface are high, compared with those across the solid boundary. For example, in the strongly unstable condition, i.e., in the thermal convection beneath the interface, the exchange coefficient is twice larger than that in heat transfer over a heated horizontal solid plate. In stably stratified conditions, the stratification depresses the turbulent motion into the internal waves and causes low exchange coefficient.A turbulence closure model for stratified flow was deduced, based on the Reynolds stress and turbulent heat flux equations and a theoretical prediction of the stratification effects on the exchange coefficient was presented.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,7459016,,,,,,,,KYUSHU UNIVERSITY,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14219700,,

Such methods help identify the chemicals formed when crude oil is subjected to photochemical changes in the environment. The nature and behavior of these products are important in oil spill remediation. The project involves collaboration with the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. In addition, the project trains young scientists through direct involvement of high school students, high school teachers, and undergraduate students. This project identifies the types of compounds formed when crude oil is exposed to sunlight and investigates structures of photoproducts present in the gas phase, the aqueous phase, and the oil phase. The project utilizes fractionation methods, chromatography, and derivatization to assess the functional groups present in photoproducts.

Wind and sea currents are responsible for ice loads on structure. The design of these structures is based on load level which is usually determined by the drift ice features i.e. ice ridges and surrounding level ice fields if icebergs are not dominating in the area. Ridges drift and hit fixed or moored surface structures such as platforms or ships, or they may scour the seabed endangering pipelines and wellheads. Realistic Constitutive models will help to build more accurate numerical analysis of the ice load. It will decrease the capital costs for the offshore structures, resulting in more economic field development for arctic offshore. This literature review paper is focused on existing models used to simulate the constitutive behavior of the ice rubble. In the first chapter of ridge types, their formation and typical geometrical features has been discussed. The second chapter gives a review of Ice Rubble Failure and Deformation Mechanisms are discussed. The third chapter gives a brief comparison of between discrete model and continuum model.

Four types of overpressured traps (filled, underfilled, unfilled, and drained) are recognized. The diversities in petroleum-bearing properties reflect the complexities of petroleum accumulation and leakage in overpressured reservoirs. Forced top seal fracturing, frictional failure along preexisting faults, and capillary leakage are the major mechanisms for petroleum loss from overpressured reservoirs. The hydrocarbon retention capacities of overpressured traps are controlled by three groups of factors: (1) factors related to minimum horizontal stress (tectonic extension or compression, stress regimes, and basin scale and localized pressure stress coupling); (2) factors related to the magnitudes of water-phase pressure relative to seal fracture pressure (the depth to trap crest, vertical and/or lateral overpressure transfer, mechanisms of overpressure generation); and (3) factors related to the geomechanical properties of top seals or sealing faults (the tensile strength and brittleness of the seals, the natures and structures of fault zones). Commercial petroleum accumulations may be preserved in reservoirs with pressure coefficients greater than 2.0 and pore pressure/vertical stress ratios greater than 0.9 (up to 0.97). The widely quoted assumption that the fracture pressure is 80%-90% of the overburden pressure and hydrofracturing occurs when the pore pressure reaches 85% of the overburden pressure significantly underestimates the maximum sustainable overpressures, and thus, potentially the hydrocarbon-retention capacities, especially in deeply buried traps.

The pore structure and its controlling factors of the transitional shales may differ compared to marine and continental shales. Therefore, understanding them is of importance to the gas production behavior from transitional shales. In this work, a detailed experimental program combining rock composition analyses of X-ray diffraction (XRD), total organic carbon (TOC) analysis and Rock-Eval pyrolysis, and pore structure characterization by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and low temperature nitrogen and carbon dioxide adsorption/desorption analysis were conducted on 16 continuously sampled shale cores from the east margin of the Ordos Basin, China. The results show that these transitional shales are rich in clay minerals with an average value of 58.2% (ranging from 47.7% to 85.0%), which is much higher than that in marine and lacustrine shales. The TOC contents are averaged at 1.3 wt%, and the shales are generally in mature to high mature stage (vitrinite reflectance (R-o) between 1.26% and 1.43%). Unlike the marine and lacustrine shales, the pores in the transitional shale are mainly occurred in clay minerals, and the organic matter pores are relatively poor and isolated. The pore shapes are dominantly intra-particle and inter-particle pores of slit-shaped as identified from the FE-SEM observations and the nitrogen adsorption/desorption curves. The meso (2-50 nm) and macro pore (generally of 50-300 nm) size distributions are unimodal to bimodal, and micropores (< 2 nm) vary between 0.4 and 0.85 nm. The micropores and mesopores are abundant for all the shale samples, accounting for more than 90% of the total pore volume and specific surface area. The surface fractal dimension D-1 and space structure fractal dimension D-2 were obtained from the nitrogen adsorption data. The D-1 values show no obvious relationship with clay minerals, TOC and quartz contents, which means that the pore surface irregularity is similar for all the samples. The D-2 values show a positive relationship with clay mineral content, showing the clay minerals directly influencing the pore structure and pore diameters heterogeneity. For successful development of transitional shales gas, a further investigation on the clay mineral composition are necessary, with an emphasis on its influence on well drilling and hydraulic fracturing.",,,,,,,,,183,31,0,0,2,0,196,,,0016-2361,1873-7153,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Min & Technol, State Key Lab Coal Resources & Safe Min, Beijing 100083, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Min & Technol, Coll Geosci & Surveying Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R ChinaCSIRO Energy, Private Bag 10, Clayton, Vic 3169, AustraliaChina United Coal Bed Methane Co Ltd, Beijing 100011, Peoples R China",China United Coal Bed Methane Co Ltd,,,2019-02-27,WOS:000458760500041,,

This paper makes a significant contribution to current analytical efforts to account for realistic aEuro center dot second-best climate mitigation policy implementation. This is achieved via a technical classification of secondbest common mode issues at a detailed national level: both internal (behavioural change, infrastructure implementation) and external (new technologies, resource availability). Under a combinatory second-best scenario, meeting targets greater than a 70% reduction in CO2 by 2050 entail costs above a subjective barrier of 1% of GDP, while extreme mitigation scenarios (> 90% CO2 reduction) are infeasible. These high costs are equally due to disappointing progress in behavioural and technological mitigation efforts. Expensive second-best mitigation scenarios can still rely on extreme assumptions including the full deployment of the UK's offshore wind resource or the complete diffusion of energy efficiency measures in end-use sectors. By demonstrating the fragilities of a low carbon energy system pathway, policy makers can explore protective and proactive strategies to ensure targets can actually be met.

Ecologically clean and high-speed processing of different intersystem organic wastes for inclusion of their elements into matter turnover processes is necessary in those BLSS. At the Institute of Biophysics SB RAS the method of physical-chemical utilization of organic wastes in water solution of hydrogen peroxide under the effect of alternating current, the so-called method of 'wet' incineration, has been developed. In the result of that processing a mineralized solution is generated which can be used as a component of plant fertilizer and some gas composition containing basically oxygen and carbon dioxide after a full cycle of gas treating. The given method suitability was proved by numerous experiments on cultivated plants' growing using the reactor products after the human metabolites (solid and liquid wastes) and plant wastes (wheat straw and plant inedible biomass) utilization and by many publications in rating scientific journals both in Russia and abroad. However, sanitary wastes are generated besides plant and human wastes in BLSS, the mass of which can reach significant amounts in the course of the station operation. The given wastes can be divided into the following categories, food, packing, sanitary and hygienic waste (napkins, towels, paper napkins, facial tissues, paper towels, paper, hygienic and medical disposables, etc.). According to the researches carried out the daily increase of their mass per a human can reach up to 2kg/(d*m), therefore their utilization probability with a further introduction of mineral elements becoming available into nutrient solutions for the higher plants unit is an arising question. Thus, the method development of sanitary wastes utilization aimed at obtaining fertilizer in respect to BLSS appears to be an actual scientific problem. The given project suggests using the earlier developed technology of 'wet' oxidation as the basic utilization method adapted to the project tasks set up. For that purpose at the first stage a model mixture of sanitary wastes will be formed, including food waste, napkins, towels, paper packing and most probable some other elements. Then, that mixture will be mineralized in the reactor of 'wet' oxidation at different regimes of physical-chemical processing (current strength, voltage, probably, nitric acid introduction as an additional oxidizer), and when necessary supplementary processing methods will be involved such as catalytic oxidation in solid and fluid phases, autoclaving, etc. The first stage will result in the development of the most optimal method of the waste utilization according to the parameters of mineralization depth and generated products' safety. At the second project stage the testing experiments of the nutrient solution prepared with usage of mineralized sanitary waste and their comparison with the control represented by a standard nutrient medium. The scientific novelty of the given project consists on the one hand in the development of ecologically clean mineralization technology of sanitary waste, on the other hand in the involvement technology of those waste in the BLSS mass exchange characterized ecological safety and accessibility of the obtained products for their assimilation by a higher plant unit both in a liquid phase (at the expense of nutrient solution) and possibly in a gaseous form (for example, CO2). In case of the pollutants' generation then the ways of their transformation into the products easily incorporated into the matter turnover process will be found.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,17-74-10147,,,,,,,,Institute of Biophysics of Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences,Institute of Biophysics of Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15295743,,

A measure of wind exposure is fetch, the distance over which wind can travel across open water. In large lake systems, such as the Laurentian Great Lakes, estimating fetch has proven to be difficult due to their vast size and complex topobathymetry. Here we describe the development of two spatially discrete indicators of exposure to provide a more accurate indicator of the influence of wind exposure in the nearshore of the Laurentian Great Lakes. We summarized wind data from offshore buoys and used existing tools to calculate effective fetch and a relative exposure index (effective fetch scaled by mean wind speed) at a 30-m grid cell resolution. We validated these models by comparing our exposure maps to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wave Information Studies models and found general agreement.

The various structures have distinct characteristics that make the nanotubes suitable for various physical applications. It is due their unique electrical, mechanical and thermal attributes CNTs present thrilling opportunities for mechanical engineering, industrial, scientific research and commercial applications. There is fruitful potential for carbon nanotubes in the composites business and industry. Today, CNTs find utilization in frequent various products, and analyst continue to explore new applications. Currently applications comprise wind turbines, bicycle components, scanning probe microscopes, flat panel displays, marine paints, sensing devices, electronics, batteries with longer lifetime and electrical circuitry etc. Such applications in mind, entropy optimized dissipative CNTs based flow of nanomaterial by a stretched surface. Flow is caused due to stretching phenomenon and studied in 3D coordinates. Both types of CNTs are studied i.e., SWCNTs and MWCNTs. CNTs are considered for nanoparticles and water for continuous phase fluid. Special consideration is given to the analysis of statistical declaration and probable error for skin friction and Nusselt number. Furthermore, entropy rate is calculated. Entropy rate is discussed in the presence of four main irreversibilities i.e., heat transfer, Joule heating, porosity and dissipation.METHOD: Homotopy technique is utilized to develop the convergence series solutions.RESULTS: Impacts of sundry variables subject to both SWCNTs (single) and MWCNTs (multi) are graphically discussed. Statistical analysis and probable error for surface drag force and Nusselt number are numerically calculated subject to various flow variables. Numerical results for such engineering quantities are displayed through tables. In addition, comparative analysis for SWCNTs and MWCNTs are presented for the velocity, concentration and thermal fields.CONCLUSIONS: Results for entropy rate is calculated in the presence of various sundry variable through implementation of second law of thermodynamics. It is examined from the results that velocity decreases for both CNTs via higher magnetic, inertia coefficient and porosity parameters. Secondary velocity i.e., velocity in g-direction boosts up versus rotation parameter while it declines for larger slip parameter for both CNTs. thermal field intensifies for both CNTs via larger heat generation/absorption parameter. Concentration which shows the mass transfer of species increases subject to higher homogeneous parameter and Schmidt number in case of both CNTs. Entropy rate in more for larger magnetic, Reynolds number and slip parameter. Bejan number boosts up for higher Reynold number and slip parameter while it declines for magnetic parameter.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,1872-7565,,,,,,,,,,"Department of Mathematics, Quaid-I-Azam University 45320 Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.

The main constraint on this analysis is the lack of long-term marine instrumentation and data. In order to overcome this difficulty, we use oceanic numerical modelling with data from reanalysis models, climatic data from remote sensors, and primary data from existing instrumentation and fieldwork. The models were calibrated and run to calculate based on existing marine systems the potential nationwide marine power resources, on different time and spatial scales, for both the Colombian Caribbean and Pacific coasts. For each marine resource, we first explain the method used to assess the power potential; then we present the potential marine energy result. Further, we carry out a policy analysis where we discuss not only the power potential but also the barriers (mainly cost) faced by marine energy. Given the potentials found by earlier studies, these results define for Colombia, and also for Central and South America generally, the road map for future pre-feasibility analysis, taking into account the energy demands of the populations, existing technologies, and the environmental, social and geographical characteristics of the regions.

Cells were Cram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped and motile by means of a polar flagellum, Growth occurred at NaCl concentrations between 0 and 20%; the optimum was 5% NaCl. One strain, which was designated VT8(T), could degrade n-hexadecane, pristane and some crude oil components. It grew anaerobically in the presence of nitrate on succinate, citrate or acetate, but not on glucose. Several organic acids and amino acids were utilized as sole carbon and energy sources. The major components of its cellular fatty acids were C-12:0 3-OH, C-16:1 omega 9c, C-16:0 and C-18:1 omega 9c, The DNA G+C content was 55.7 mol%, 16S rDNA sequence analysis indicated that strain VT8(T) was closely related to Marinobacter sp, strain CAB (99.8% similarity) and Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus (99.4% similarity). Its antibiotic resistance, isoprenoid quinones and fatty acids were similar to those of Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus and Pseudomonas nautica, However, the whole-cell protein pattern of VT8(T) differed from that of other halophilic marine isolates, including P. nautica, DNA-DNA hybridization indicated that the level of relatedness to Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus was 65% and that to P, nautica was 75%, Further differences were apparent in Fourier-transformed IR spectra of cells and lipopolysaccharide composition. It is proposed that V18(T) should be the type strain of a new species and should be named Marinobacter aquaeolei, P. nautica may have been misclassified, as suggested previously, and may also belong to the genus Marinobacter.",,,,,,,,,165,4,0,0,126,0,200,,,0020-7713,,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Genet & Allgemeine Biol, A-5020 Salzburg, AustriaNatl Ctr Nat Sci & Technol, Inst Biotechnol, Hanoi, VietnamUniv Vienna, Inst Genet & Mikrobiol, A-1030 Vienna, AustriaUniv Munich, Inst Bot, D-80638 Munich, Germany",Inst Genet & Allgemeine Biol,,,1999-04-01,WOS:000080024500004,10319457,
J,,,,,,,,,Matthew Lewis,,"Improving Methods of Characterising Resource, Interactions and Conditions (METRIC)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 28 2018,2018,"Electricity can be generated through the conversion of the kinetic energy that resides in tidal currents in a similar way to a wind turbine. The ubiquitous nature of tidal energy, and the predictability and reliability of tidal currents, gives tidal-stream energy distinct advantages compared to other renewable energy technologies. Individual tidal energy devices have been installed and proven, with commercial arrays planned throughout the world. Yet, the true global resource and ocean conditions are broadly unknown, affecting optimal global device design. Present methods are unsuitable as the industry matures beyond the fast, shallow, well-mixed, and wave sheltered demonstration sites - influencing investor confidence. Transformative understanding of this sustainable natural resource for the coming century is therefore needed to bring a step change towards a sustainable, high-tech and globally exportable, UK renewable energy industry. CHALLENGE 1: How much tidal energy is there in the world and how is it distributed? OBJECTIVE 1: Resolve the true tidal-stream energy resource using unique datasets, consistent modelling framework, and state-of-the-art modelling techniques.Global tidal resource assessments are based on coarse, data constrained, models that are not validated for the few tidal energy sites resolved, as developed for other applications (e.g. global energy budgets); therefore, the global tidal energy resource is only broadly known. Fine-scale bathymetric constrictions (e.g. coral reef passes), biological communities (e.g. flow diverted around kelp beds) and ocean currents, can all accelerate currents between constrictions; meaning many sites initially dismissed as commercially unviable may actually be suitable. A consistent modelling framework (e.g. resolution and physics), and comparison of modelling techniques, will be developed to reduce bias and determine the potential global resource. CHALLENGE 2: How do conditions vary globally and will this change in the coming century? OBJECTIVE 2: Realistic oceanographic conditions at potential tidal-stream energy sites for the coming century will be determined For sustainable device design, realistic oceanographic conditions must be characterised for the lifetime of deployments, and cascaded through high-fidelity device-scale models (e.g. CFD); yet oceanographic conditions, and the impact of climate change, at tidal energy sites is largely unknown. Previously unviable tidal energy regions may become economically viable in the future (as near-resonant tidal systems and their associated currents are sensitive to sea-level rise), and, due to wave-tide interaction processes, oceanographic conditions at tidal energy sites may change. Dynamically coupled wave-tide ocean-scale models will be developed to inform the developing industry (e.g. optimal and resilient design), with new techniques that can simulate the interaction between the resource and devices. CHALLENGE 3: Are current methods of suitable as the industry develops? OBJECTIVE 3: Improved methods of device behaviour in resource and environmental assessment models The industry is evolving beyond fast, shallow, well-mixed and wave sheltered sites, to areas of the world with complex oceanographic conditions (e.g. ocean currents and swell wave dominated climates). New approaches are needed to understand the interactions between devices, resource and environment. Device-scale interaction studies assume well-mixed (i.e. homogenous) channelized flows, with tidal turbine loading from waves assessed assuming waves travel in-line with tidal currents (waves following or opposing current), which is not the case beyond an extremely limited number of tidal straits (e.g. Pentland Firth). Furthermore, device interaction with the flow must also be resolved within resource assessment, beyond simplified momentum sink terms. Device behaviour and interactions will improved at both ocean and device scales.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/R034664/1,,,,,,,,Bangor University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15324891,,

Among the deep-water production platforms the tension leg platform (TLP) has proven itself to be a reliable platform choice for deep-water oil and gas developments. A riser is a unique element connecting the deck with sub sea wells and is critical to safe field operations. Though investigations reported on the riser behavior due to platform motions are many, the reported literature on the effect of riser dynamics on TLP behavior is very few. In deeper waters, risers and tethers contribute significant inertia and damping due to their longer lengths, larger sizes and heavier weights. This paper investigates the effect of riser dynamics on the response characteristics of deep water TLPs using a nonlinear finite element analysis program. To account for the nonlinearities associated with waves of large steepness, a Hybrid wave force model is proposed, which is a combination of the relative velocity model of the Morison equation and the higher order terms in the FNV model developed by Faltinsen et al. (Non linear wave loads on a slender vertical cylinder. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 289, 179-198, 1995.) Current force is also included along with the wave forces. Parametric studies have been conducted for TLPs in two water depths; 900 m and 1800 m and wave steepness (H/L) ratios of 0.025, 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1. Results are reported in the form of power spectral density functions, mean and dynamic responses. The natural periods of TLPs are also estimated and compared with published results. The tether tension is found to increase due to inclusion of risers. The surge response is found to decrease when risers are included.",,,,,5th International Conference on Fluid Structure Interaction5th International Conference on Fluid Structure Interaction,"MAY 25-27, 2009MAY 25-27, 2009",Wessex Inst Technol; WIT Transact Built EnvironmWessex Inst Technol; WIT Transact Built Environm,"Crete, GREECECrete, GREECE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1746-4498,,978-1-84564-182-5,,,,,,,,,"NSS Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Palakkad, Kerala, IndiaIndian Inst Technol, Dept Ocean Engn, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000271825000020,,

This study was performed combining daily images obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor located onboard the Aqua and Terra satellites. Composites were generated by averaging pixels with the same forcing conditions. River discharge shows a strong relation with the extension of the Tagus plume. The plume grows with the increasing river discharge and express a two day lag caused by the long residence time of water within the estuary. The Tagus turbid plume was found to be smaller under northerly and easterly winds, than under southerly and westerly winds. It is suggested that upwelling favoring winds provoke the offshore movement of the plume material with a rapidly decrease in turbidity values whereas downwelling favoring winds retain plume material in the north coast close to the Tagus mouth. Eastern cross-shore (oceanward) winds spread the plume seaward and to the north following the coast geometry, whereas western cross-shore (landward) winds keep the plume material in both alongshore directions occupying a large part of the area enclosed by the bay. Low tides produce larger and more turbid plumes than high tides. In terms of fortnightly periodicity, the maximum plume extension corresponding to the highest turbidity is observed during and after spring tides.

The method consists of collecting on moving strips of filter paper the daughter products of radon and thoron decay [long dash]principally Pb212 and Pb214. The highest activities found were 5 x 10-13 curies per liter of atmosphere and the lowest values in the order of 10-14 curies per liter. Changes in radioactivity may take place very rapidly so that a very high value may fall to one of the low values within an hour or less. Recent history of the air mass being sampled determines its content of these radioactive isotopes of natural origin. Maximal values are always characterized by still air held over land. Minimal values have been associated with air masses having been held over the sea where replenishment of radon is much reduced. The turbulence of winds causes mixing of radon with greater masses of air with correspondingly diluted levels of radioactivity. In spite of the high degree of variability in atmospheric radioactivity from day to day or even from hour to hour, averages of the mean hourly activities when taken over a year in Berkeley, Calif., show well defined diurnal fluctuation. In this respect, data for 1955 are very close to those for the year 1956 On the yearly average, maximum activity occurs at 6 a.m. and minimum activity at 6 p.m. The averaged radioactivity of the atmosphere in the morning is about 40% greater than the activity in the evening. This difference is probably a reflection of the tendency for offshore winds to migrate inland during the afternoon hours. Samplings of stagnant air in wells and caves showed very high activity as compared to the open atmosphere. As much as 10-10 curies per liter of air have been observed in enclosed atmospheres. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. abst",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kearney Foundation Soil Sci , U.

The horizontal advection of the chlorophyll is approximately one order larger than the horizontal diffusion averaging the whole study area. And the sea surface currents are found to correlate with the wind stress but only for part of the middle shelf. Based on the horizontal advection simulation driven by IF radar current, the bloom is divided into three sub-regions. The northern coastal section of the bloom shows high-low-high pattern in chlorophyll time series, which is related to coastal upwelling and a clockwise eddy. Coastal currents play an important role in the eddy formation and the southward transport of the bloom. The southern coastal section of the bloom is supported by the nutrients from coastal upwelling and driven offshore by wind. The northeast section of the bloom is fueled by nutrient source upwelled through Ekman pumping. The magnitude of Ekman pumping is of the same order as the magnitude of the upwelling along the coast. These identified mechanisms could also applied to more than half of bloom events during 2002 to 2013. In the summer of 2011 off the coast of New Jersey, processes in different sub-regions worked together, leading to this large phytoplanlcton bloom. (C) 2115 Elsevier Ltd.

It includes the development of the methods for strength analysis and evaluating the stability and security of designed potentially unsafe constructions (nuclear power facilities, containers for transporting of radioactive material, high-pressure vessels, oil pipelines and etc.) under extreme operating modes. The problem under consideration lies at the intersection of physics, nonlinear mechanics and computational mathematics. At the present time it is poorly studied, although native and foreign scientists have done a lot in the area. The problem solving requires conducting the comprehensive experimental and theoretical research of the deformation and limit states of the materials in a wide range of thermo-mechanical, quasi-static and dynamic complex loadings. It takes into account the large elastoviscoplastic deformation, structure changes, transitions the dynamic systems to chaotic oscillations and interaction mechanics of the deformable constructions with filling mediums and environments. This defines high scientific importance and topicality of the proposed project. During the project a set of the mathematical models, solving methods and software tools will be developed. They form the computational model, which includes: i) The deformation models, which are based on physical theory of elastoviscoplasticity to describe the state and evolution of meso- and microstructures and physical and mechanical properties of the multicomponent polycrystalline materials with taking into account the phase transition; ii) The models of nonlinear dynamic, which describe the harmonic and chaotic oscillation modes of the mechanic systems and include beams, plates and shells under various loading and bound conditions with taking into account geometrical and physical nonlinearity and contacts interactions; iii) The models of optimal control of movement the rigid and deformable bodies into the liquid and solid mediums under the influence of internal sources of vibration; iv) The experimental and computational method for analysis of the processes of elastoviscoplastic deformation and identification the parameters of the material mathematical models and structure elements under inhomogeneous stress-strain state, large deformations and quasi-static and dynamic loadings; v) The efficient numerical methods for solving non-stationary nonlinear problems of dynamics of deformable media and structures of the class in question; vi) The algorithms and software products, which realize the developed mathematical models on the PC. These will be adapted for multi-processor computer systems. The theoretical and experimental researches will be conducted to identify and verify the proposed mathematical models, solving methods and software tools. The strength, limit states and safety of designed nuclear power structures under extreme operating conditions, the stability of oil platforms and sea pipelines, technic processing of the structural materials will be investigated based on the models. Intensification the processes of the heat and mass transfer due to fluctuations of streamlined bodies will be studied to design mini fan cooling for electronic boards.

A time decomposition of hydrometeorological conditions conducive to the initiation and intensification of aeolian processes in the coastal zone was also performed. In addition to their scientific significance, the temporal and spatial conditions for aeolian processes on the Baltic coast of Poland have an essential utilitarian significance. Modern aeolian processes on the Baltic coast limit the development potential of the coastal zone. Aeolian processes have a positive and negative impact on geomorphological transformation of the sea coast. They take part in the reconstruction of the beach and foredunes after storms. In periods between storms, coastal wind is seen to decrease the balance of beach sediments and lowers the beach area. On the other hand, onshore wind favors, among other things, filling of tourist infrastructure and development located at the hinterland of the beach and dunes. Hydrometeorological conditions especially favorable to the intensification of aeolian processes are the main determinants of geomorphological changes in the coastal zone (some of which can be extreme).

Large scale hydrogen markets may provide essential cross-vector system balancing and inter-seasonal energy storage for an energy system dominated by the UK's abundant renewables, especially high-capacity factor, offshore wind and marine resources. This gas to hydrogen transition can most effectively build out from the UK's critical natural gas infrastructure.The Milford Haven Waterway is at the centre of nationally important energy infrastructure, with major energy related investment underway, targeting efficiency and decarbonisation. Facilities include South Hook LNG terminal, Dragon LNG terminal, RWE's 2.2GW CCGT, and National Grid's NTS pipeline that connects the Milford Haven Waterway with other assets like Grain LNG terminal, in Kent, and St Fergus gas terminal, Aberdeenshire.The Milford Haven Energy Kingdom Detailed Design project will focus on developing diverse, local seed markets to support the transition, to hydrogen and renewables, of the cluster of major energy infrastructure along the Milford Haven Waterway. This transition will occur via a mixture of pathways available locally -- meeting heating and transportation needs of local communities, including via fuel cell vehicles; creating transport solutions for Pembrokeshire's 4.2 million annual tourists; H2 production from curtailed onshore wind and solar generators; and improving off-take markets for offshore renewables in the South-Western Approaches, including the consented Pembrokeshire Demonstration Zone (PDZ).Project partners Pembrokeshire County Council, Riversimple, Milford Haven Port Authority, Wales and West Utilities, and Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult, with assistance and support from Energy Systems Catapult, RWE, Western Power Distribution, Arup and Welsh Government Energy Services, will design a local, renewables-hydrogen energy system for the Milford Haven Waterway. This will feature a flexibility trading platform to lower costs for consumers using hydrogen-ready hybrid heat pumps and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and to help lift constraints on local development of solar, wind and offshore renewable power generation. A novel system architecture will allow integration from national to local network levels, and future integration of major natural gas infrastructure and current and future large-scale hydrogen infrastructure.The project will immediately build hydrogen-ready features and technologies into the Port's housing, commercial and renewables projects and will allow local people to test real-world hydrogen vehicles and home heating equipment.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,105848,,,,,,,,Pembrokeshire County Council,Pembrokeshire County Council,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15358603,,

Methods: Gastric emptying was measured as the appearance of acetaminophen in plasma which represents an indirect measure of gastric emptying. Emulsified fats with added acetaminophen were fed by gavage to rats, and the plasma concentration of acetaminophen was followed for 3 h by repeated blood sampling from the carotid artery. The fats administered included rapeseed, corn, and fish oils, lard, and cocoa butter as well as different structured lipids containing decanoic acid (10:0) and long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids of marine origin. Overall, these fats had wide variations in fatty acid compositions and triacylglycerol structures. Results: No statistically significant differences were observed in gastric emptying between the groups fed the different fats, except for the emptying of tridecanoin (tri-10:0) that was statistically significantly slower than that of randomized oil, cocoa butter, and rapeseed oil (p < 0.05). The slower emptying of tri-10:0 could be caused by a lower caloric intake of this fat as compared with the other fats, because similar weights of fat were administered. Conclusion: The gastric emptying of fat was not influenced by fatty acid composition and triacylglycerol structure of the fats administered. Copyright (C) 2003 S.

The study of gas hydrates in the South Caspian is necessary for reliable assessment of energy potential of hydrocarbon gases in Azerbaijan. The results of the study of gas hydrates can also be applied to assess the role of gas hydrates in the near-surface layers of the geosphere, especially in connection with their possible impact on ecology of the Caspian Sea, the region and global climate change.The aim of the research is to identify and estimate the volumes of hydrocarbon gases of gas hydrates of the deep-water part of the South Caspian by seismic data.The object of the research - 17 regional seismic profiles and data on thermodynamics of the region. When interpreting seismic profiles the authors have emphasized the identification of horizons containing gas hydrates.Research methods are based on the presence of a direct relationship between the features of the geological structure of the gas hydrate zones and distribution of physical parameters in the medium. Anomalous changes in the seismic characteristics of waves can serve as indicators of gas hydrate at a time section: amplitude, frequency, phase, velocity of longitudinal and transverse waves. The presence of the reflecting seismic horizon BSR, as well as bright spots on the seismic records is widely used seismic attribute of gas hydrate. All the time sections are interpreted according to these criteria and the upper and lower boundaries of the zones with reflections characteristic of the gas hydrate zones are established. The data were interpreted using the licensed software package Kingdom Suite 2017.As a result of the research, the authors constructed the maps of the lower and upper boundaries of the gas hydrate zones, and calculated the thickness of the deposits containing gas hydrates. The rock volumes determined by seismic data enabled to calculate the volumes of hydrocarbon gases contained in gas hydrates. The maximum volume of gas in the investigated zone is 8,0610 12 of gas. The volume of gas hydrates contained in the rock within the structures was calculated as well.

Turbulent fluxes are calculated using the eddy-correlation method with extensive observations. The total numbers of quality-controlled 30 min flux runs are 12,240, 5813, and 5637 for estimation of C-D, C-H, and C-E, respectively. When adjusted to neutral stability using the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST), we found that C-DN, C-HN, and C-EN decrease with neutral-adjusted wind speed when wind speed is less than 5 m/s. C-DN is constant over the range 5 m/s<12 m/s, then increases with U-10N when U-10N>12 m/s. In contrast, C-HN and C-EN exhibit no clear dependence on wind speed and are generally constant, with mean values of 0.96 x 10(-3) and 1.2 x 10(-3), respectively. This behavior of neutral exchange coefficients is consistent with the findings of previous studies. We also found that C-DN under offshore winds is generally greater than that under onshore wind conditions, which is ascribed to the younger wind waves present due to the shorter fetch in the former case. However, this behavior is not exhibited by C-HN or C-EN. The original C-D, C-H, and C-E values without MOST adjustment are also investigated to develop a new parameterization based on wind speed and stability. Three stability parameters are tested, including the bulk Richardson number, stability as defined in COARE 3.0, and a simplified Richardson number using the Charnock parameter. This new parameterization is free of MOST and the associated self-correlation. Compared with previous studies and COARE 3.0 results, the new parameterization using the simplified Richardson number performs well, with an increased correlation coefficient and reduction of root-mean-square error and bias.",,,,,,,,,17,3,0,0,0,0,19,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China, Phys Oceanog Inst, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Qingdao, Peoples R ChinaNatl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Environm Modeling Ctr, Natl Ctr Environm Predict, Natl Weather Serv, College Pk, MD USANatl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Hurricane Res Div, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL USAUniv Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL USAChina Meteorol Adm, Inst Trop & Marine Meteorol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,,,2017-05-01,WOS:000404363600034,,

The transfer of dissolved gases across the air/water interface of freshwater lakes is critical to numerous ecosystems. Protection of these ecosystems requires an understanding of this interfacial gas exchange problem. While there is a large body of research on gas exchange across air/water interfaces at the high wind speed conditions typical of oceans, little has been done to study the low wind speed conditions that are common on lakes. The proposed research seeks to address this critical need, focusing on the transport of dissolved gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, under low wind speed conditions where both forced convection and natural convection play a role; a transport regime referred to as mixed convection. This research will also focus on how gas transfer is affected by the single molecule thick organic films called 'surfactant monolayers', which are ubiquitous on lakes. The research will consist of a set of laboratory experiments utilizing a wind/water tunnel where the transfer of dissolved gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide will be measured as a function of wind speed and air-water temperature difference. The effect of surfactant contamination on transport will be quantified by introducing these surfactants on the water surface in a controlled fashion. The fluid flow structures responsible for the observed gas exchange phenomena will be investigated using flow visualization techniques, including infrared imaging of the water surface and laser induced fluorescence imaging of the subsurface flow. The proposed research will result in improved models of the effect of human activity on lakes, more accurate global climate change models, and improvements in the efficiencies of numerous industrial processes.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,500155,,,,,,,,Clemson University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14020251,,

This fuel can be produced from a variety of feedstocks, such as first-generation biodiesel feedstock (corn, peanut, soybean), second generation (jatropha, animal fats, waste cooking oils, macroalgae), and third generation (microalgae). Among these feedstocks, biodiesel production from microalgae has drawn special attention for different reasons: they have high lipid content and high growth rates; they are tolerant to severe environmental conditions; they offer the possibility of sequester carbon dioxide from the flue gases; their harvesting and transportation are economical compared to other crops; and they have very high photosynthetic yields compared to other terrestrial plants. The advantage of using macroalgae recollected on the beaches as raw material is that allows to obtained energy from a residue.Microwave-assisted extraction and transesterification of microalgae is being researched as a solution for biodiesel production by its benefits, such as shorter reaction times and less amount of heat energy to obtain biodiesel. It is due to the fact that microwaves can easily penetrate through the cell wall structure to extract and transesterify the oils into biodiesel.The aim of this research was to explore the possibility of carrying out the microwave-assisted transesterification of three marine macroalgae (brown and green). Different experimental runs were carried out with different process parameters such as macroalgae-to-methanol ratio, reaction time and catalyst concentrations. Based on the obtained results, the best conditions for microwave-assisted transesterification reaction were macroalgae-to-methanol ratio of 1:15 (wt/vol), sodium hydroxide concentration of 2 wt % and reaction time of 3 min.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,1556-7036,1556-7230,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Vigo, Chem Engn Dept, ETSEI, Vigo 36310, SpainDef Univ Ctr, Escuela Naval Militar, Plaza Espana 2, Marin 36920, Spain",Def Univ Ctr,,,2016-07-06,WOS:000377879200014,,

The reservoir is saturated by overpressured light oil, and the development is based on first-contact-miscible gas injection.The reservoir is highly stratified, with a fine sequence of depositional cycles and long-range lateral correlations. Three porosity systems (matrix, karst, and fractures) can be organized in two main environments: a massive, low-permeability, matrix-like inner platform and a highly fractured/karstified rim.The reservoir geology is modeled by means of detailed geological grids consisting of tens of millions of cells, with vertical spacing of 1 m or even less to account for high-order depositional cycles. Geological grid cannot be used to run compositional simulations, and much-coarser grids, in which hundreds of geological layers are lumped in few tens of dynamic layers, are used by reservoir engineers. To minimize coarse-scale errors, an average lateral spacing of 250x250 m is used for both simulation and geological grid; nonetheless, upscaling remains a challenge. Traditional permeability (k*) upscaling methods, including flow-based methods, overestimate Kashagan field/wells production and injection potentials.We implemented a method in which the outcome of the upscaling is effective transmissibility (P) instead of k*. T* upscaling has been proposed in the past as an alternative to k* upscaling, but it is neither part of commercial workflows nor widely accepted in the reservoir-modeling community. In our T* upscaling, the solution of local flow problems around coarse-cell interfaces is used to compute coarse transmissibility. T* and k* upscaling were compared by simulating both single-phase and gas-injection problems, including platform and rim, using the results of fine-scale simulation as a reference. We considered (1) single-porosity simulations with geological grid populated by only matrix (first medium) and karst+fracture (second medium) properties and (2) dual-porosity/dual-permeability simulations encompassing both media. Contrary to k* upscaling, T*-based coarse simulations perfectly replicate fine-scale field and well injection/production potentials.Using T* upscaling as a cornerstone for company activities on Kashagan, we can run coarse-scale full-field simulations in a few hours without loss of consistency with the results provided by weeks-long, often unpractical, fine-scale simulations. On the contrary, the inaccuracy of k* upscaling would have required much finer and more computationally-expensive simulation grids together with the implementation of ad hoc multiphase upscaling.",,,,,,,,,6,1,0,0,0,0,6,,,1094-6470,1930-0212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012-05-09,WOS:000303030000003,,

This has allowed both unsteady blade loading and hydrodynamic noise radiation to be predicted. The study is motivated by the need to assess environmental impact of tidal devices, in terms of their acoustic impact on marine species.Inflow turbulence was accounted for using A synthetic turbulence generator, with statistics chosen to represent the gross features of a typical tidal flow. The turbine is resolved in a fully unsteady manner using a sliding interface technique within the OpenFOAM (R) libraries. Acoustic radiation is estimated using a compact source approximation of the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation.It is observed that the long streamwise length scale of the inflow turbulence results in characteristic 'humps' in the turbine thrust and torque spectra. This effect is also evident in the far-field noise spectra. The acoustic sources on the blades are visualised in terms of sound pressure level and Powell's source term. These measures show that the dominant sources are concentrated at the blade leading edges towards the tip. This results from the high loading of the turbine blades, and causes the sound to radiate more akin to a monopole than a dipole.The full scale source level, obtained from scaling of the simulation results, is found to be lower than comparable measured data reported in the literature; this is attributed to additional sources not included in the present study. Based on the predicted source level, no physical impact on fish is expected. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparison of the GC and GCMS data of the synthetic monoenes with those obtained for a sedimentary C20 monoene from Gluss Voe (Shetland Isles, UK) and two C25 monoenes from the Tamar estuary, showed that the double bonds in these compounds were probably in non-methylenic positions.These findings may have important implications. The differences in double bond positions may reflect contributions of alkenes from different source organisms, or from the same organisms living under different environmental conditions. In time the compounds may prove to be useful biological markers of recent and palaeoenvironments.

The historical picture of the plume from the Columbia River is of a freshwater plume oriented southwest offshore of the Oregon shelf in summer and north or northwest along the Washington shelf in winter. Recent CTD data and new data from moored sensors support a picture quite different from the historical seasonal pattern. Specifically, the plume is frequently present up to 150 km north of the river mouth on the Washington shelf from spring to fall, even during periods of upwelling. The plume is frequently bi-directional, with branches both north and south of the river mouth. During a downwelling event, the southwest plume moves onshore over the Oregon shelf. At the same time, a new plume forms north of the river mouth over the Washington shelf, trapped within similar to 20-30km of the coast. This plume propagates and also is advected northward by inner shelf currents that reverse during downwelling. When winds return to upwelling-favorable, inner shelf currents reverse immediately to flow to the south and the shallow plume is advected offshore in the wind-driven Ekman layer. Once over the central shelf, the plume is advected farther south by the seasonal mean ambient flow. Overall, freshwater from the Columbia plume overlies the Washington shelf similar to 50% or more of the summer. Capping of upwelling on the inner shelf by the Columbia freshwater plume is illustrated, where the capping potential is related to stratification and wind magnitude and duration. Evidence is also presented to suggest that the seaward front of the Columbia River plume may provide a barrier to the transport of harmful algal blooms to coastal beaches in summer and early fall.

In this study, we examined the microbial community in aquifers subjected to sulfate containing fluid injection. Formation water samples were collected from production wells located at different distances from the injection wells. The chemical analysis showed that the injection fluid contained oxygen, nitrate, nitrite and sulfate, in contrast to the formation water, which had previously been shown to be depleted in these components. Sulfur isotopic analysis indicated that sulfate derived from the injection fluid was present in the sample collected from near the injection wells. Quantitative and sequencing analysis of dissimilatory sulfite reductase and 16S rRNA genes revealed that sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, and anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) in the wells located near injection wells were more abundant than those in wells located far from the injection wells, suggesting that fluid injection stimulated these microorganisms through the addition of oxygen, nitrate, nitrite and sulfate to the methane-rich aquifers.

Due to the complexity and dynamic nature of coastal environments and the small scales of frontal gradient zones, frontal research is difficult. To advance this challenging research we developed a method enabling an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to detect and track fronts, thereby providing high-resolution observations in the moving reference frame of the front itself. This novel method was applied to studying the evolution of a frontal zone in the coastal upwelling environment of Monterey Bay, California, through a period of variability in upwelling intensity. Through 23 frontal crossings in four days, the AUV detected the front using real-time analysis of vertical thermal stratification to identify water types and the front between them, and the vehicle tracked the front as it moved more than 10 km offshore. The physical front coincided with a biological front between strongly stratified phytoplankton-enriched water inshore of the front, and weakly stratified phytoplankton-poor water offshore of the front. While stratification remained a consistent identifier, conditions on both sides of the front changed rapidly as regional circulation responded to relaxation of upwelling winds. The offshore water type transitioned from relatively cold and saline upwelled water to relatively warm and fresh coastal transition zone water. The inshore water type exhibited an order of magnitude increase in chlorophyll concentrations and an associated increase in oxygen and decrease in nitrate. It also warmed and freshened near the front, consistent with the cross-frontal exchange that was detected in the high-resolution AUV data. AUV-observed cross-frontal exchanges beneath the surface manifestation of the front emphasize the importance of AUV synoptic water column surveys in the frontal zone. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In particular, the destabilization process is inspected by a systematic comparison of the wake morphology of a propeller operating in pure axisymmetric flow and in drift with angle of 20 degrees, under different loading conditions. The wake behaviour in oblique flow shows a markedly different character with respect to the axisymmetric condition: in the latter, the destabilization is triggered by an increasing interaction of the main vorticity confined in the tip vortex; whereas, in the former, the role of the secondary vorticity (oriented in the streamwise direction) as well as the hub vortex seems to be crucial. The features of the wake have been investigated by the lambda(2) criterion (Jeong & Hussain, J.

Previous studies have shown that the source rocks have a relatively high hydrocarbon generation conversion rate, and several oil-bearing structures have been found in the study area. In this study, core samples of the Neogene saline lacustrine fine-grained sedimentary rocks from representative wells in the study area were collected and investigated. Based on the testing of organic matter abundance, type, and maturity, combined with X-ray diffraction, high-pressure mercury injection (HPMI) and low-temperature liquid nitrogen adsorption tests (N-2-GS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thin section observations, the hydrocarbon accumulation conditions and pore-development-influencing factors of the samples were studied in detail. New research suggests that (1) Neogene fine-grained sedimentary rocks have relatively low total organic carbon (TOC) content, and the organic matter distribution is controlled by the salinity in the northwestern Qaidam Basin. The salinity and type I organic matter content of the fine-grained sedimentary rocks increase from the Shangganchaigou formation (N-1) to the Shangyoushashan formation (N-2(2)), whereas their maturity tends to decrease. (2) Mesopores are developed dominantly in these samples. The SEM observations show that most of the pores are interparticle, intraparticle, and intercrystal pores, which are mainly open (parallel plate pores), semiopen, and a certain amount of ink-bottle pores. This is not conducive to macropore development in high-salinity samples because schistose salt minerals cover their surfaces. (3) Salinity, mineral content, TOC content, and thermal maturity play important roles in the pore distribution of Neogene fine-grained sedimentary rocks in the northwestern Qaidam Basin, which have salinity as the core-controlling factor. Within a certain salinity range, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area and mesopore volume of the samples increase gradually with the increasing salinity, whereas the macropore volume changes irregularly. When salinity becomes very high, the BET specific surface area, mesopore volume, and particularly the macropore volume of the samples decrease. This is unfavorable for pore formation and preservation in fine-grained sedimentary rocks. (4) The contents of quartz, feldspar, and pyrite in the samples decrease with increasing salinity, whereas the contents of carbonate mineral and clay mineral increase. The specific surface area of the samples shows a certain positive correlation with the clay mineral content and a negative correlation with the carbonate mineral content. The mesopore volume is positively correlated with TOC content, the sum content of quartz, feldspar, and pyrite, and clay mineral content but negatively correlated with the thermal maturity and carbonate mineral content. Therefore, the fine-grained sedimentary rocks with moderate salinity, relatively high organic carbon content, mature stages, and well-developed pores should be considered for unconventional oil exploration and development in the saline lacustrine basin.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,0,5,,,0887-0624,1520-5029,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Petr, Coll Geosci, Beijing 102249, Peoples R ChinaSuzhou Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Coal Mine Water Hazard Controll, Suzhou 234000, Anhui, Peoples R ChinaGeol Explorat Technol Inst Anhui Prov, Hefei 230041, Anhui, Peoples R ChinaUniv Sci & Technol China, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R ChinaPetro China, Res Inst Petr Explorat & Dev, Langfang 065007, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Geomech, Beijing 100081, Peoples R ChinaRes Inst Innovat Technol Earth, Kyoto 6190292, Japan",Geol Explorat Technol Inst Anhui Prov,,,2020-05-01,WOS:000526414800010,,

Citric acid (2790 ng in unit mg of pollen mass) was found as most abundant species in the Pollen_Gosan, followed by oxalic acid (2390 ng mg(-1)). Although citric acid was not detected in the Pollen_cedar and Pollen_cypress as major species, it was found as a dominant species in the tangerine juice while malic acid was detected as major species in the tangerine peel, followed by oxalic and citric acids. Since Japanese cedar trees are planted around tangerine farms to prevent strong winds from the Pacific Ocean, citric acid that may be directly emitted from tangerine is likely adsorbed on pollens emitted from Japanese cedar and then transported to the Gosan site. Much lower malic/citric acid ratios obtained under cloudy condition than clear condition suggest that malic acid may rapidly decompose to lower molecular weight compounds such as oxalic and malonic acids (",,,,,,,,,20,1,0,0,8,0,22,,,1352-2310,1873-2844,,,,,,,,,,"Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan",,,,2011-09-15,WOS:000294242400004,,

LH11-1 field is a reef heavy oilfield (16-23 degrees API), and overall development efficiency is not ideal. In this study, the CO2 flooding potential in LH11-1 field was evaluated through a compositional simulation using the Petrel and CMG-GEM tools. A detailed fluid characterization was performed to accurately represent the reservoir fluid. 1D slim tube and core flood simulations were interpreted to understand the physical mechanisms of oil recovery. A reservoir geological (structure, facies and fluids) model was constructed in Petrel system and the model was calibrated using manual and assisted history matching methods. The natural depletion and continuous CO2 injection scenarios were simulated by GEM. Results indicate that the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) of crude oil in Liuhua field is approximately 20 MPa. Therefore, the mechanism of oil recovery by CO2 EOR in Liuhua field should be suitable for immiscible CO2 flooding. The continuous CO2 injection would recover an incremental 7% of OOIP in Liuhua field, and the CO2 storage efficiency is relatively high with more than 95.5% of injection CO2 has been stored in the reservoir which indicate an important significance for CO2-EOR and storage potential in offshore carbonate oilfield.",,,,,8th International Congress on Environmental Geotechnics (ICEG)8th International Congress on Environmental Geotechnics (ICEG),"OCT 28-NOV 01, 2018OCT 28-NOV 01, 2018","Chinese Inst Soil Mech & Geotechn Engn; Zhejiang Univ, Minist Educ Key Lab Soft Soils & Geoenvironmental Engn; Hong Kong Geotechn Soc; Int Soc Soil Mech & Geotechn Engn, Tech Comm 215 Environm GeotechniChinese Inst Soil Mech & Geotechn Engn; Zhejiang Univ, Minist Educ Key Lab Soft Soils & Geoenvironmental Engn; Hong Kong Geotechn Soc; Int Soc Soil Mech & Geotechn Engn, Tech Comm 215 Environm Geotechni","Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINAHangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,1863-5520,1863-5539,978-981-13-2227-3; 978-981-13-2226-6,,,,,,,,,"South China Sea Inst Oceanol, CAS Key Lab Ocean & Marginal Sea Geol, Guangzhou 510301, Peoples R ChinaChengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610051, Peoples R ChinaUniv Texas Austin, Bur Econ Geol, Austin, TX 78713 USAUK China Guangdong CCUS Ctr, Guangzhou 510663, Peoples R China",UK China Guangdong CCUS Ctr,,,2019-01-01,WOS:000607217200001,,

In the present study, we use a particle tracking model based on satellite altimetry measurements and wind reanalysis data, as well as satellite measurements (SeaWiFS, MODIS), to investigate the interannual variability in the Danube plume pathways during the summer from 1993 to 2015. The wind conditions largely define the variability in the Danube water propagation. Relatively low-frequency variability (on periods of a week to months) in the wind stress curl modulates the intensity of the geostrophic Rim Current and related mesoscale eddy dynamics. High-frequency offshore wind-drift currents transport the plume across isobaths and provide an important transport link between shelf and offshore circulation. Inherent plume dynamics play an additional role in the near-mouth transport of the plume and its connection with offshore circulation.During the years with prevailing northeast winds (similar to 30% of studied cases), which are usually accompanied by increased wind curl over the Black Sea and higher Danube discharge, an alongshore southward current at the NorthWestern Shelf (NWS) is formed near the western Black Sea coast. Advected southward, the Danube waters are entrained in the Rim Current jet, which transports them along the west coast of the basin. The strong Rim Current, fewer eddies and downwelling winds substantially decrease the cross-shelf exchange of nutrients.During the years with prevailing southeastern winds (similar to 40%), the Rim Current is less intense. Mesoscale eddies effectively trap the Danube waters, transporting them to the deep western part of the basin. The low- and high-frequency southeastern wind-drift currents contribute significantly to cross-isobath plume transport and its connection with offshore circulation. During several years (similar to 15%), the Danube waters moved eastward to the west coast of Crimea. They were transported on the north periphery of the mesoscale anticyclones due to prevailing eastward wind-drift currents. During the years with hot summers, a monsoon effect induced the formation of a strong anticyclonic wind cell over the NorthWestern Shelf (NWS), and the plume moved northward (similar to 15%). Anticyclonic wind circulation leads to the Ekman convergence of brackish surface waters in the centre of the shelf and the formation of a baroclinic geostrophic anticyclone north of the NWS. This anticyclone traps the Danube waters and forces them to remain on the shelf for a long period of time. The impact of the propagation of the plume on the variability in chlorophyll a chlorophyll a in the NWS and the western Black Sea is analysed in this study based on satellite data.",,,,,,,,,26,0,3,0,6,0,28,,,0924-7963,1879-1573,,,,,,,,,,"RAS, Marine Hydrophys Inst, Fed State Budget Sci Inst, Sevastopol, UkrainePP Shirshov Oceanol Inst, Moscow, Russia",RAS,,,2018-02-16,WOS:000424171800002,,

These problems are increasingly global in nature and transcend political boundaries. The only effective way to solve these global challenges is for scientists to engage in international collaborations to find solutions; however, doing this is not a trivial task. How can we find and contact collaborators from foreign countries? Where do we obtain the resources to support international projects? How can communication with foreign scientist be productive despite language and culture barriers? Few graduate academic programs provide guidance or training in conducting international research. The Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) has developed the Limnology and Oceanography Research Exchange (LOREX) program to address this deficiency. Over the next 3 years ASLO will offer an international research engagement program for graduate level professional development in limnology and oceanography. This program will provide all graduate student society members training in designing and coordinating international collaborative research through seminars, workshops and web-based materials. In addition, thirty student members will be selected each year to apply this knowledge and carry out research projects that they design in collaboration with scientists from one of several collaborating limnologic and marine institutes overseas (Australia, Sweden, Israel and Canada) which represent different aquatic systems and related challenges. Through this experience ASLO will train future scientists to become productive and engaged global scientists. The Limnology and Oceanography Research Exchange (LOREX) is a formal training and professional development program in international research collaboration in the aquatic sciences offered by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO). The goal of this program is to catalyze the development of globally engaged U.S. aquatic scientists by providing a multi-stage, high-quality training and research program for graduate students. The program supports students in initiating and carrying out international research from the stage of formulating creative ideas and research proposals with the international community, networking and communicating with peers at home and abroad, through the execution of original collaborative research projects at four international institutes with diverse expertise in both marine and freshwater sciences. Professional development will be facilitated through workshops highlighting communication and collaboration training, webinars addressing various challenges and opportunities in international collaboration as well as non-academic industries; dedicated sessions at ASLO conferences featuring student and international collaborator research; and additional online resources. Each year, up to thirty students will be selected to participate in the research exchange experience at one of four international locations (Australia, Sweden, Israel and Canada). This experience will prepare future scientists to conduct collaborative work, serve to expand networks, and improve science through collaborations. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1831075,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13673280,,

WEST combines two models that operate at different spatial scales. The Mesoscale Compressible Community (MC2) model is a mesoscale numerical weather prediction model that produces simulations over large domains of the order of a thousand kilometres. The MC2 model uses long-term synoptic scale wind climate data from the analysis of radiosonde and other observations to simulate mean wind fields at tens of metres above the ground using a horizontal resolution of a few kilometres. The mesoscale results are used as input to MS-Micro/3 (Mason and Sykes (1979) version of the Jackson and Hunt (1975) model version for microcomputers/3-dimensional; MS-Micro hereafter), a more computer-efficient, microscale model with simpler linearized momentum equations and a domain restricted to a few tens of kilometres with horizontal grid sizes of tens or hundreds of metres. MS-Micro provides wind field results at specific wind generator hub heights (typically 30 to 50 in above ground level (AGL)) which are of interest to researchers and developers of wind farms.WEST shows relatively strong correlations between its simulated long-term mean wind speed and the measurements from ten wind energy monitoring stations. However, in the mountainous terrain of the Yukon, WEST tends to predict wind speeds which art about 40% too high. The model also produces erroneous wind directions and some were perpendicular to valley orientations. The most likely cause of the wind speed and direction errors is the substantially modified 5-km grid-spaced mesoscale terrain used in MC2. The WEST simulation was also found to double the wind speeds observed at airport stations and there was poor correlation between the simulated and observed wind speeds.The bias in the model could be attributed to a number of factors, including the use of smoothed topography by the model, the discrepancy between the neutral atmosphere assumed in MS-Micro and the normally observed stable atmosphere, the application of MS-Micro to every third grid point of the MC2 output, abnormally high sea level wind speeds in the input climate data for MC2, and a certain degree of disagreement between the land surface characteristics used in the model and those found in the field.At comparatively low computer cost, WEST predicts a wind climate map that compares favourably to the wind measurements made in several locations in the Yukon. However, the problem of the modified terrain in the mountainous regions is the most pressing problem and needs to be addressed before WEST is used in the mountainous regions of Canada.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,1,15,,,0705-5900,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, CanadaMSC, RPN, Dorval, PQ, Canada",MSC,,,2005-09-01,WOS:000232106100006,,

The markers can summarise and characterise the behaviour of these devices from their dynamic response available as time series data. The behaviour may be linear or nonlinear and consequently a marker that can track the changes in structural situations can be quite important. These markers can then be helpful in assessing the current condition of the structure and can indicate possible intervention, monitoring or assessment. This paper considers a Delay Vector Variance based marker for changes in a tension leg platform tested in an ocean wave basin for structural changes brought about by single column dampers. The approach is based on dynamic outputs of the device alone and is based on the estimation of the non:linearity of the output signal. The advantages of the selected marker and its response with changing structural properties are discussed.

A significant relationship was found: well-developed phytoplankton structures were generally related to moderate or intense offshore transport, whereas the absence of plumes corresponded to either weak offshore transport or coastal convergence. For each of the three coastal areas in this study, scatter plots showed linear relationships between digital counts of phytoplankton concentration and sea surface temperature. The spatial variation of the temperature range decreased in time after the onset of an upwelling event. One cause of this variation could be the north-south change in temperature of the upwelled Eastern North Atlantic Central Water along the Portuguese coast.",,,,,,,,,84,0,0,0,28,0,93,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV PIERRE & MARIE CURIE, PHYS & CHIM MARINES LAB, VILLEFRANCHE SUR MER, FRANCE",,,,1992-07-15,WOS:A1992JE56400013,,

In this study, we combined in situ measurements with model simulations to quantify short-term bed-level changes on a meso-macrotidal wetland in the Yangtze River Delta. On the middle flat, we observed erosion during neap to-mean tides under onshore moderate-to-strong winds, and bed recovery during subsequent spring tides, when winds were both offshore and weaker, suggesting that winds can overturn the neap-spring cyclicity of bed-level changes even on meso-macrotidal mudflats. The magnitude of bed-level changes was smaller on both sides of the middle flat, while the smallest changes occurred on the salt marsh. Observed bed-level changes were reconstructed using a single-point bed-level change model, which incorporates in situ measured parameters of hydrodynamics (waves and currents), suspended sediment concentrations, and bed sediment properties. We conclude that the relative importance of waves and tides in intertidal wetland erosion and accretion can vary temporally (due to changes in balance between wave and tidal energies) and spatially (because of changes in elevation and vegetation in the cross-shore profile). Our study also reflects the advantage of combination of in situ measurement with simulation in detecting short-term variability of tidal flats. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Not all such embayments have beaches however, and beaches in embayments can be removed by storms and may subsequently reform. What dictates the presence or absence of an embayed beach and its resilience to storms? In this paper, we explore the effect of offshore slope and wind conditions on nearshore sediment transport within idealised embayments to give insight into nearshore sediment supplies. We use numerical simulations to show that sand can accumulate near shore if the offshore slope is >0.025m/m, but only under persistent calm conditions. Our modelling also suggests that if sediment in an embayment with an offshore gradient steeper than 0.025m/m is removed during a period of persistent stormy conditions, it will be unlikely to return in sub-decadal timescales. In contrast, sediment located in embayments with shallower gradients can reform swiftly in both calm and stormy conditions. Our findings have wide implications for contemporary coastal engineering in the face of future global climate change, but also for Quaternary environmental reconstruction. Our simple method to predict beach stability based on slope can be used to interpret differing responses of embayments to periods of changing coastal storminess such as the medieval climate anomaly-little ice age (MCA-LIA) transition.

Causal factors include world population growth at present and growing exponentially. Increases of personal incomes and wealth have created more increased consumption of public/private housing transit and transportation which have in turn increased demand for raw materials, natural and mining resources such as gas, coal, oil sand and ocean oil/gas exploration.The melting of the North Pole's glaciers has affected the ocean levels flooding of river and creeks and as well affected agricultural production on a major scale.In order to have clean environment on earth, we need a flexible management to cope with global warming and its impact on our quality of life. An alternative to coal and fossil fuels which are directly causing climate change through heat-trapping gases that are warming the atmosphere must be technologically found and implemented as early as possible. A mix alternative and clean energy such as solar panels, hydro, wind-turbines and bio-mass energy system has to be developed and implemented. This requires a close cooperation among public institutions, private industry, technical experts, university researchers, financially and administratively, among all nations. Nuclear energy can be considered as an alternative clean energy and must be developed and also monitored for the safety.According to the world wildlife fund Canada released a list of the ten top Canadian cities in terms of greenhouse gas emission reductions, municipal targets, green building codes and green transportation, Vancouver ranked first, with a score of 8.1 out of ten, followed by Toronto (7.2) and Montreal (6.2). Vancouver has reduced emission to 1990 is the only Municipality on track to meet Kyoto and has the greenest building code in Canada.Some of the important Green Energy Strategy and Development in Canada have been designed and implemented by various Provinces listed as follows:B.C. established the BC forest and range practices act (BCFRPA) which was one of the first in North America requiring tenure holders to pursue sustainable forest management planning and to provide measurable results.Ontario Provincial Government passed a new green act to explore solar, wind, water and biomass new technological energy.

The Gas-Liquid Cylindrical Cyclone (GLCC) employs the coupled effects of centrifugal force and gravity to separate gas and liquid. It has been reported that the GLCC is possibly the only separator available in subsea conditions. However, there are two hindering factors to the GLCC's separation performance. They are Liquid Carry-over (LCO) and Gas Carry-under (GCU). The Upper Swirling Liquid Film (USLF) that exists in the upper cylinder of the GLCC is believed to be a direct source of the LCO. This study attempted to explain the flow regimes and flow behavior of the USLF using experimental and simulated methods. Firstly, four kinds of fluids (water, 35% aqueous glycerin, 49.6% aqueous glycerin and Therminol 55) were used to test the performance of an ID-74 mm GLCC at different gas-liquid throughputs. The gas volumetric flow rates ranged from 100 m(3)/h to 200 m(3)/h and the liquid flow rates from 0.6 m(3)/h to 2.7 m(3)/h. Four flow regimes of USLF were defined based on the experimental observations. They were swirling flow, churn flow, annular flow and ribbon flow, respectively. Flow pattern maps for them were constructed. Secondly, an Eulerian Wall Film (EWF) model was used to numerically study the effect of fluid properties and operational conditions on the flow behavior of the USLF. It was found that the film height grew with the increase of the gas flow rates and the distribution of the film thickness became less uniform with the increase of the liquid flow rates. A liquid with low surface tension and high viscosity usually produced an unfavorable annular flow regime. Thirdly, based on the mechanistic analysis of the film flow, the flow in the upper cylinder was divided into three segments: the centrifugal segment, the drag-up segment and the escaped segment. A judgment model was established for the flow regimes of USLF after combining with the flooding theory. Finally, the action of USLF on LCO phenomenon was divided into three stages: safety stage, deteriorating stage and stable stage. They corresponded to the flow regimes of swirl flow, churn flow and annular flow respectively.",,,,,,,,,53,11,0,0,1,0,59,,,1385-8947,1873-3212,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Petr, State Key Lab Heavy Oil Proc, Beijing 102249, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Key Lab Proc Fluid Filtrat & Separat, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China",Beijing Key Lab Proc Fluid Filtrat & Separat,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000450105700075,,

To use these sensors in portable equipment such as gas monitors, the power used to keep the film sensitive to the operating temperature is required to be very low. The results of this development provide with a platform for the manufacture of gas microsensors that allow different types of sensor films can be incorporated. Methodology: The developed microsensor consists of a thin fil of SnO2 deposited on a micro-machined silicon substrate. The proposed design was carried out by simulations of mechanical and thermal behavior. The procedure included microfabrication operations, and then, the electrical characterization was performed and the sensitivity to gaseous ammonia was tested. Results: Microfabrication was carried out satisfactorily (although this work does not detail all the steps of the process), and a high rate of well-formed sensors per sheet was achieved. The behavior of the sensor in the presence of different concentrations of gaseous ammonia in air was characterized and resulted in a linear response for concentrations between 6 ppm to 50 ppm, and the latter is the permissible limit of exposure. Conclusions: A low consumption (50 mW) SnO2 gas microsensor was successfully developed based on previous simulations. In relation to future work, the developed micromachined platform with the built-in heater will allow the use of different sensor films.","Resumen Contexto: En este trabajo se presenta el desarrollo y microfabricación de un sensor de gas cuyo funcionamiento se basa en las variaciones de su conductividad eléctrica en presencia de determinados gases.

This great tidal resource attracts tidal energy developers. Harnessing the high potential of the Alderney Race requires deploying numerous turbines in arrays. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of the wake effects on the electrical dynamics of commercial tidal farms. The proposed methodology is applied to a hypothetical tidal farm in the Alderney Race. The influence of the wake effects on the power produced by a tidal farm is assessed by comparing simulations where the effect is neglected to simulations with wake effects. Two operational conditions are analyzed: Normal operation (one-day simulation with varying tidal speed); grid disturbances (voltage dip at the tidal farm point of common coupling). Simulations show that neglecting the wake effect implies significant errors in active power estimation at the point of common coupling during normal operation. Moreover, differences in the behavior of the system during voltage dip occur if the wake effect is not taken into account.",,,,,,,,,7,1,0,0,0,0,7,,,1949-3029,1949-3037,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Caen Normandy, Lab Univ Sci Appl Cherbourg, F-14000 Caen, France",,,,2018-01-05,WOS:000418644700031,,

Due to the extreme depth and broad area of impacted region, it is critical that the presence and structures of oil plumes be determined for accurate mass balance calculations, estimating damage, and understanding the overall chemical/physical behavior of individual hydrocarbons comprising the oil. There exists considerable uncertainty on the presence of subsurface plumes reported by other researchers. The latter is due, in part, because the findings are based on in situ fluorescence typically used to measure dissolved organic matter. In addition, these findings only provide an estimate of total oil. To provide a robust and higher resolution dataset on the hydrocarbon distribution and structure in the Gulf of Mexico, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will deploy the TETHYS in-situ mass spectrometer. TETHYS compliments conventional sampling by providing near-continuous records and by providing far greater spatial resolution. Additionally, real time feedback from TETHYS can be used to guide conventional sampling. The TETHYS in-situ mass spectrometer is optimized for long-term unattended environmental monitoring of low molecular weight (2-200 amu) gases and volatile chemicals in a variety of hostile environments. TETHYS is also unique among field-portable or underwater mass spectrometers in that it retains high mass resolution in the low-mass range (1-25 amu), allowing it to quantify hydrogen, helium, and methane. In this study of the Deepwater Horizon spill, TETHYS will be deployed on two different subsea platforms: an enhanced CTD rosette and the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Sentry. The research team will work collaboratively with a number of other investigators from Woods Hole, Texas A & M University, and the University of California at Santa Barbara who have separately received RAPID funding to study various aspects of this historic oil spill. All of these investigators have prior experience with the TETHYS/CTD/Sentry technology. Broader Impacts: Results from this research are expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of petroleum fate and carbon cycling in the Earth system. Knowledge gained from this research will also be translated and transmitted directly to state and federal agencies involved in the spill damage assessment and restoration. The project will provide the concepts, processes, and parameters necessary for existing industry oil spill models to be adapted to the unparalleled situation of a major oil release on the deep sea floor. The continued expansion of offshore drilling operations into deeper waters may lead inevitably to the risk of more spills in the future.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1045025,,,,,,,,Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13878209,,

We are interested in both fundamental and practical issues. Examples of the former include the manner in which stable background stratification (the situation that exists when the fluid density increases with depth) alters the evolution of the wake, and the underlying physics of the process by which (for strong enough stratification) the small-scale three-dimensional wake turbulence is converted into a single large, persistent (essentially two-dimensional) dipolar vortex . The practical applications include remote detection of submerged bodies via the signature they leave in the ocean surface. The work is also relevant to a broad range of other engineering and geophysical problems, including the behaviour and environmental impact of wakes created by aircraft, yachts, supertankers, and wind and tidal turbines. Results are obtained from large-scale simulations on the national High Performance Computer (HPC) facilities (HECToR): Numerical experiments of turbulent wakes in a virtual ocean are performed using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) to produce high-fidelity solutions of the equations that govern the unsteady dynamics of the turbulence (the Navier-Stokes equations). Since these DNS solutions (which involve no approximations or phenomenological models) faithfully capture the details of the turbulence at each point in the flow field, they can be used to provide unambiguous answers to the fundamental and practical questions with which we are concerned.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/G05035X/1,,,,,,,,University of Southampton,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15303751,,
J,,,,,,,,,,,Reducing the Impact of Social distancing To Offshore Renewable Energy (RISTORE),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2020,2020,"The offshore wind energy sector has been significantly impacted by COVID-19, primarily due to the implementation of social distancing regulations and their effect on staff on vessels. Offshore inspection, both for survey where new windfarms are to be installed, and for regular maintenance of existing infrastructure, have been affected by project delays and increased costs to businesses working in the sector. RISTORE will optimize the subsea inspection of offshore renewable energy assets with an intelligent data-oriented approach. RISTORE will reduce the human presence requirement on site by deploying a system based on state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning on the edge, and the infrastructure to allow two-way communications with remote operators and analysts.The system will have benefits in several areas:* Environmental: by reducing the numbers of personnel required offshore, vessels used can be smaller and increased survey efficiency will reduce the time required at sea. This will have the effect of less fuel consumption reducing the direct environmental impact and the cost to the wind energy sector.* Cognitive load for operators: surveying tasks can be cognitively demanding and tedious. By employing machine learning, operators will be able to leverage an automated tool for inspection, increasing the efficiency and accuracy of surveys.* Increasing diversity and accessibility to the sector: by enabling onshore survey analysis and decision making, many of the barriers and restrictions to working in the sector are removed.* Sectoral resilience to COVID-19: Current restrictions now require lengthy quarantine periods and testing pre-deployment. Removing the requirement for many personnel to deploy offshore enables operations to continue whilst complying with social distancing / social bubble regulations.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,78096,,,,,,,,Rovco Limited,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15309663,,

Intensification of the Chinese Coastal Current and Changjiang Diluted Water (CDW) spreading to the south together with coastal downwelling caused by the northerly wind was observed in the summer of 2015. This physical forcing led to a well-ventilated area in the north and a hypoxic area of 1.3 x 10 4 km(2) in the south, while in 2017 the summer monsoon (southerly winds) induced offshore transport in the surface layer that caused a subsurface intrusion of Kuroshio-derived water to the shallower areas (<10 m depth) in the north and upwelling in the south. Wind-driven Ekman surface flow and reversal of the geostrophic current related to the upwelling compelled alteration of the Chinese Coastal Current. Consequently, intense hypoxia (DO down to 0.6 mg L-1) starting from 4 to 8 m depth connected to CDW and deep water intrusion in the north and coastal hypoxia linked to the upwelling in the south were observed in 2017.Distinct situations of stratification and DO distributions can be explained by wind forcing and concurrent features in surface and deep layer circulation, upwelling and downwelling events. Enhanced primary production in the upper layer of the CDW or the upwelled water determines the location and extent of DO depletion. Likewise, the pycnocline created by Kuroshio subsurface water intrusion is an essential precondition for hypoxia formation.Wind forcing largely controls the interannual change of hypoxic area location and extent. If the summer monsoon prevails, extensive hypoxia more likely occurs in the north.

Increases in the number of intense cyclones occurring in the Northern Hemisphere since the 19705 is evident with more northward tracking patterns developing. This brings added potential risk to coastal environments and infrastructure in northwest Europe and therefore understanding how these high-energy storms impact sandy coasts in particular is important for future management. This study highlights the evolution of Storm (formally Hurricane) Ophelia in October 2017 as it passed up and along the western seaboard of Ireland The largest ever recorded Hurricane to form in the eastern Atlantic, we describe, using a range of environmental measurements and wave modelling, its track and intensity over its duration whilst over Ireland. The impact on a stretch of sandy coast in NW Ireland during Storm Ophelia, when the winds were at their peak, is examined using terrestrial laser scanning surveys pre- and post storm to describe local changes of intertidal and dune edge dynamics. During maximum wind conditions (>35 knots) waves no >2 m were recorded with an oblique to parallel orientation and coincident with medium to low tide (around 0.8 m). Therefore, we demonstrate that anticipated widespread coastal erosion and damage may not always unfold as predicted. In fact, around 6000 m(3) of net erosion occurred along the 420 m stretch of coastline with maximum differences in beach topographic changes of 03 m. The majority of the sediment redislribution occurred within the intertidal and lower beach zone with some limited dune trimming in the southern section (10% of the total erosion). Asynchronous high water (tide levels), localised offshore winds as well as coastline orientation relative to the storm winds and waves plays a significant role in reducing coastal erosional impact.

J,,,,,,,,,"Ogorodov,Stanislav",,Development of a united system of comprehensive monitoring of thermoabrasional and ice gouging processes in the coastal and shelf zone of the Russian Arctic Seas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 1800,2019,"According to its definition, abrasion is a process of destruction of the coasts anf underwater slope. For the seas situated in the cryolithozone, the coasts of which are composed by frozen sediments, along with mechanical abrasion, executed by waves and storm surges, thermal abrasion is characteristic. Thermal abrasion develops under the influence of thawing of the frozen grounds due to their contact with water and air. In fact, these two processes act simultaneously, and therefore thermal abrasion should be determined as a thermomechanical process. Thermoabrasional coasts have low resistance to erosion. About half of the coasts of the Russian Arctic seas are composed by perennially frozen loose deposits and are therefore vulnerable for thermal abrasion. In the natural conditions such coasts can retreat with rates of 1-3 m per year. One of the consequences of the global climate warming is considerable increase of wave abrasion and thermal abrasion in the last decade. It is determined by changes in the thermal and wave energy regime and by the sea level rise. The increase of the ice-free period duration and wave fetch length leads to the enhance of the wave action on the coast, which, in its turn, influences coastal dynamics by the increase of abrasion. Climate warming is most brightly expressed in the dynamics of the coasts composed by perennialy frozen grounds. On some sections of the Arctic coasts, rates of retreat reach 5-10 m per year. During one year, Russia loses a territory comparable to the area of a small European Country, e.g., the Principality of Liechtenstein, within its Arctic coasts only. The dynamic impact of ice formations (sea ice and icebergs) on the bottom are attributed to the category of dangerous processes. The most wide-spread of them is ice gouging. Ice gouging is destructive mechanical action of sea ice on the underlying surface. The mechanical action on the coasts and bottom of the freezing seas is connected with the dynamics and drift of sea ice, its mobility, hummocking and formation of stamukhas under the influence of hydrometeorologic factors and of the relief of the coastal zone. Ice gouging can act in the coastal zone up to 15-20 m a.s.l. on land and up to depths of 15-30 m, or even 50-65 m, on the bottom. Keels of big hummocky formations reaching depths of 50 m, were directly observed from submarines. Hummocky formations, created from multiannual sea ice with high resistance can make ice gouges of up to 4 m depth on the bottom during their movement with the currents, wind and due to mechanical interaction with ice fields. The deepest areas of the shelf which can be affected by icebergs calving from glaciers have not been documented for the Russian Arctic; however, in the Arctic conditions their depth can be estimated as not less than 100-150 m. In the regions of the glaciers coming to the ocean where the icebergs calve, holes and gouges up to 10 m occur on the sea bottom. At present, a new stage of the development of remote oil and gas fields on the shelf of the Arctic seas starts. In the last decades, due to the exploration of oil and gas resources on the coasts and shelf of the Russian Arctic, human impact on the coastal systems has been rapidly growing. On the coasts and in the coastal-shelf zone, numerous engineering facilities are being constructed and operated oil terminals, drilling and production platforms, underwater pipelines, other living or industrial objects and infrastructure. Constructing of oil and gas fields and creating facilities for conservation and transportation of carbohydrates in the severe Arctic conditions require a complete assessment of natural factors determining geoecological and geotechnical safety. However, as experience shows, in most of the cases, these objects are constructed and operated without due account of the coastal dynamics and sea ice impact on the coasts and bottom. Unfortunately, at oil and gas facilities, design and construction without account of coastal processes and sea ice action have often lead to emergencies and considerable money loss. In particular, underwater pipelines exposed as a result of abrasion are very likely to face sea ice action. Examples of that are the Varandey industrial area in the Pechora Sea and the Kashgan site in the Caspian Sea (Ogorodov, 2005; Chernikov, 2006; Buharitsin, Ayazbayev, 2013), where emergencies of this type made the exploration of the coastal zone more complicated and lead to considerable expenses connected with liquidation of the negative consequences and reparation of the destroyed ecosystems. In this way, investigations of hazardous geomorphic processes on the coasts and shelf of freezing seas are of both high fundamental and applied importance. At the initial stage of the RSCF in 2016-2018, an integrative technology of monitoring of thermoabrasional coasts and ice gouging microrelief in the coastal and shelf zone of freezing seas covering the whole array of the modern observational methods was elaborated and tested. The new stage of applied investigations of 2019-2020 will result in a transition from the elaborated methods and technologies to the adaptation of the fundamental results for their consequent practice implementation. The most important task during planning, design and realization of any project in the severe conditions of the coastal and shelf zone of the Russian Arctic is the safety of the construction and operation of the engineering facilities. Practically, strategic decisions on planning and constriction are often made at the stage before the investments and before prospect investigations for a certain infrastructure object, when there is absolutely no understanding which safety problems such an object will face. The construction, in its turn, is done quickly and in a hurry, before all the recommendations and advice of the research community and specialists are taken into account. A prominent example is the underwater crossing of the main gas pipeline Bovanenkovo-Ukhta across the Baydaratskaya Bay of the Kara Sea built within the zone of the most intense impact of ice formations on the bottom (Ogorodov et al., 2013). It is evident that a data and information source on the intensity of hazardous morpholithodynamic processes in the coastal and shelf zone of the Russian Arctic is necessary, that would be understandable not only for a specialist in this area, but would also be easy and available for a wide range of end users: engineers, designers, leaders at stages before the investments and prospect surveys. A map is the most appropriate and easy to understand data source on the intensity of hazardous processes and scales of their distribution. During the continuation of the RSCF project, a series of maps of abrasion and ice gouging hazards will be developed based on the methods of the segmentation of the coastline and zoning of the coastal and shelf zone according to the intensity of ice impact on the coasts and bottom, which had been elaborated in 2016-2018. These maps will compose an Electronic Atlas available online on the Web. Such an atlas can link research and practice, illustrating the intensity of processes hazardous for the operation of hydrotechnical facilities in the coastal and shelf zone of Russia. In this way, scientific unity of the project will be assured, and logical transition from the fundamental and methodological tasks of the initial stage of 2016-2018 to the explorational and scientific applied tasks of the 2019-2020 stage will be ensured. The main aim of the 2019-2020 stage will be the creation of the Electronic Atlas of the abrasion and ice gouging hazards in the coastal and shelf zone of the Russian Arctic. Synthetic maps of the abrasion and ice gouging hazards will be the main new result of the project. The maps will unite estimations of two leading geomorphic processes in the coastal and shelf zone of freezing seas, making together and separately a considerable threat to the infrastructure objects These maps will be an innovative fundamental and applied product with no analogs in Russia or abroad.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,19-17-11006,,,,,,,,Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education Lomonosov Moscow State University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15291108,,

Consequently, growing scarcity of essential resources are an ever increasing threat towards global peace and stability. This conflict potential is exacerbated by global warming and the associated sea level rise, which can once again be traced back to the rapidly growing demand for energy and food of the world's economies.In this paper we develop a comprehensive chain of cause and effect surrounding these global developments.

J,,,,,,,,,Ian Brooks,,Turbulent Exchange in the Arctic Boundary Layer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Aug 19 2007,2007,"The Arctic is one of the most sensitive regions on Earth to climate change. Observations show it to be warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world. Climate models suggest this is due to a stronger response to increases in greenhouse gases than at lower latitudes; however the model predictions also show the greatest uncertainty in the Artic, and have difficulty even reproducing current conditions. Poor model performance results primarily from a failure to adequately represent processes in the shallow atmospheric boundary layer over the ice: surface turbulent exchanges of heat and moisture, the vertical structure of the boundary layer, the properties of low-level stratus clouds, and thus the solar and infra-red radiative fluxes. Our poor understanding of these processes is a result of a lack of in-situ measurements with which to study them / a consequence of the remote location and difficulty of working over the ice. It is necessary that such measurements be made because the properties and behaviour of the Arctic boundary layer and cloud differ significantly from those in well-measured environments in mid and low latitudes. This project will make a unique set of in-situ measurements of the vertical structure of the Arctic atmosphere from the surface through the cloud layer focusing on the turbulent exchanges of momentum, heat, and moisture and the coupling between the surface and cloud layers. Such measurements have not previously been made over the central Arctic, away from the influence of continental landmasses or the open ocean. The remote location makes this region inaccessible to aircraft; the vertical profiles through the boundary layer, and measurements in cloud will thus be made with novel turbulence package carried by a tethered balloon. These measurements / in conjunction with continuous remote-sensing measurements of the lower atmosphere and cloud properties via a variety of radiometers, lidar, and radar systems provided by collaborating groups / will provide the means to understand boundary-layer and cloud processes unique to the Arctic, and to redefine their representation within climate models. The project is an integral part of a much larger international measurement programme / the Arctic Summer Cloud-Ocean Study (ASCOS) / that will take place in the central Arctic during the summer of 2008, operating from the Swedish icebreaker Oden, and coordinated by the Stockholm University. Starting close to the pole in early July the ship will be moored to a stable ice floe and will drift with the ice pack until September. Some instrumentation will be sited on masts erected on the ice away from the immediate influence of the ship; others will operate from the deck of the ship or container labs. Collaborators on ASCOS will make a wide range of other measurements: aerosol physical and chemical properties; atmospheric gas-phase chemistry; upper ocean structure; and marine chemistry and biology. The programme is highly interdisciplinary, and designed to elucidate the links between different parts of the climate system, such as the generation of aerosol particles from biological sources in the ocean, their growth and modification into particles capable of acting as cloud condensation nuclei, and the transport of those particle up into the cloud layer by turbulent transport processes. Close collaboration and sharing of data between all participants is an inherent part of the programme design.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/E010008/1,,,,,,,,University of Leeds,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15305177,,

Much of the proposed or future Lake Erie OWD infrastructure may either be within or adjacent to public lands, waters, and protected areas, raising concerns about the potential environmental and social impacts upon recreation stakeholders. The limited body of OWD research within the United States has suggested there are numerous factors that may influence overall perceptions of support and opposition such as political orientation and beliefs in climate change. Moreover, recent research has proposed that the perceived recreation impact of OWD may be the most important predictor of support and opposition. This study confirmed this premise and found the perceived recreation impact of OWD to be the strongest predictor of support. Results of a multiple linear regression suggested that political orientation (beta = 0.135), beliefs in the anthropogenic causation of climate change (beta = 0.207), beliefs in the occurrence of climate change (beta = 0213), and the perceived recreation impact of OWD among water-based recreationists (beta = 0.439) were significant predictors of support for OWD on Lake Erie (R-2 = 0.46). Study findings corroborated previous research which suggested that regional climate change beliefs and political attitudes may influence support for OWD. From a policy and management standpoint, study results highlight the importance of assessing and communicating recreation experience and use impacts when planning, developing, and managing OWD and related decisions in the United States.

To this end, we compared four extraction methods on the marine polychaete Nereis virens both exposed to crude oil and non-exposed. XCMS was used for feature detection and preprocessing; different normalization and scaling approaches were tested; and principal component analysis (PCA) was used together with basic statistical tests to ascertain common metabolic patterns and determine the most suitable extraction method. We conclude that a two-step extraction procedure with 80:20 (v/v) methanol:water on freeze dried polychaete tissue provides the best trade-off between analysis time, and extraction efficiency and intermediate reproducibility. No definitive conclusions could be drawn about the ability of the method to discriminate controls and crude oils in actual biological replicates because the experiment was carried out by design on analytical replicates only. We show that the normalization to the sum of all the common features, and the use of a weighted least squares criterion to fit the PCA by means of scaling to the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the pooled quality control samples significantly improved the clustering of controls and crude oil exposed samples.

We performed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in six healthy athletes, who had a history suggestive of lung bleeding, 1 h after a 7-min cycling race simulation and four normal sedentary control subjects who did not exercise before BAL. The athletes had higher (p < 0.05) concentrations of red blood cells (0.51 x 10(5) versus 0.01 x 10(5) . ml(-1)), total protein (128.0 versus 94.1 mu g/ml), albumin (65.6 versus 53.0 mu g/ml), and leukotriene B-4 (LTB(4)) (243 versus 0 pg/ml) in BAL fluid than control subjects.

A cross-sectional study was undertaken from March 2011 to August 2012 to assess the Q fever prevalence and to identify the major risk factors of C. burnetii infection in ruminants. A total of 516 ruminants (245 cattle, 137 sheep and 134 goats) belonging to 71 farms and localized in different ecosystems of the island were randomly selected. Samples of blood, vaginal mucus and milk were concomitantly collected from females, and a questionnaire was submitted to the farmers. Ticks from positively detected farms were also collected. The overall seropositivity was 11.8% in cattle, 1.4% in sheep and 13.4% in goats. C. burnetii DNA was detected by PCR in 0.81%, 4.4% and 20.1% in cow, sheep and goat vaginal swabs, respectively. C. burnetii shedding in milk was observed in 1% of cows, 0% in sheep and 4.7% in goats. None of the ticks were detected to be positive for C. burnetii. C. burnetii infection increased when the farm was exposed to prevailing winds and when there were no specific precautions for a visitor before entering the farm, and they decreased when a proper quarantine was set up for any introduction of a new ruminant and when the animals returned to the farm at night.

It is also a potential source of the vast amount of renewable energy using wind turbines and wave energy converters. Floating platforms hold certain advantages over fixed platforms for such harsh environment, as they allow disconnection and reconnection in the event of large icebergs or vast multi-year ice floes. They are also commercially attractive as they allow redeployment in other regions during the Arctic off-peak periods. However, such platforms will still need to encounter and withstand first-year level ice of varying sizes and from different directions. Such large ice floes will interfere with the hydrodynamic response of the floater. The hydrodynamic analysis of an isolated floater without accounting for the effect of the level ice is incomplete and may result in a un-conservative prediction of the floater's response. The lack of any simple methodology to account for the effect of level ice on the hydrodynamic behavior of the floater is the motivation behind this study. This study aims to identify the most relevant parameters affecting the multi-body hydrodynamic behavior of level ice and a single floater. A standard semi-submersible represents the floater, and a range of geometric variations of the level ice simulates the varying nature of the ice environment encountered by the floaters in the Arctic. This study validates the hydrodynamic analysis procedure against model test on an ice floe and wave interaction. The calibration of the model test provides the damping coefficient required for the frequency domain, multi-body hydrodynamic model. This investigation varies the ice orientation and distance from the floater for a detailed parametric study employing the calibrated model.Current research finds that the presence of a comparably sized level ice floe near the floater significantly influences the hydrodynamic Response Amplitude Operator (RAO) of the floater. It can diminish the RAOs in some degree of freedom while enhancing the RAOs in other degree of freedoms. This study identifies the wave direction, ice floe distance, ice floe orientation as the most important parameters. Sway and pitch motion of the floater experienced the most enhancements due to the presence of level ice floe along the incoming wave direction. Additionally, this study proposes some initial upper bound values to account for the effect of level ice floes on the RAOs generated from a single body hydrodynamic analysis.",,,,,"35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2016JUN 19-24, 2016","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4999-6,,,,,,,,,"Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore",,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000393091100020,,

The thrust areas include: oceanography and geology as it relates to preparing wind turbine sites, turbine design, environmental effects, particularly impact on flying wildlife, land use, and system management and integration into the electrical grid. The proposed work has a very good focus on a well-defined area that is of long-term importance to energy generation in the US. The investigators have an excellent background, and will provide the needed expertise to expand the use of wind power for electrical generation. The work by the proposed Center will make wind energy, particularly off-shore wind energy, more competitive with energy from non-renewable sources. The proposed Center would build on Amherst's wind research program, consolidating all aspects of wind power into a single unit.

These 'nano-diamonds' are used in a range of industries including nanotechnologies and biomedicine. Diamondoids were thought to be highly resistant to degradation, but their presumed degradation acid products have now been found in oil sands process-affected waters (OSPW) and numerous crude oils. Recently, a diamondoid-related structure, 3-noradamantane carboxylic acid, was reported to cause genetic damage in trout hepatocytes under in vitro conditions. This particular compound has never been reported in the environment but led us to hypothesise that other more environmentally relevant diamondoid acids could also be genotoxic. We carried out in vivo exposures (3 days, semi-static) of marine mussels to two environmentally relevant diamondoid acids, 1-adamantane carboxylic acid and 3,5-dimethyladamantane carboxylic acid plus 3-noradamantane carboxylic acid with genotoxic damage assessed using the Comet assay. An initial screening test confirmed that these acids displayed varying degrees of genotoxicity to haemocytes (increased DNA damage above that of controls) when exposed in vivo to a concentration of 30 mu mol L-1. In a further test focused on 1-adamantane carboxylic acid with varying concentrations (0.6, 6 and 30 mu mol L-1), significant (P < 0.05 %) DNA damage was observed in different target cells (viz. gills and haemocytes) at 0.6 mu mol L-1. Such a level of induced genetic damage was similar to that observed following exposure to a known genotoxin, benzo(a)pyrene (exposure concentration, 0.8 mu mol L-1).

The survival and successful transport of fish eggs and larvae results from complex biological and physical processes. This study focuses on the advective processes, more specifically on how the dynamics and characteristics of the ocean currents shape the Lagrangian pathways in the Southern Benguela. A mesoscale eddy resolving interannual (1989-2010) simulation of the region, with a horizontal resolution of 7.5 km, is used to study processes impacting the connectivity between the western edge of the Agulhas Bank and the west coast upwelling region. A set of Lagrangian experiments are conducted with particles being released within the top 100 m of the water column along an across-shore transect off Cape Point (34 degrees S). Transport success is given by the ratio of the number of particles that reach St Helena Bay (32 degrees S) over the total number of particles released. The model results show a strong seasonal cycle in transport success which is governed by the complex three-dimensional structure of the along-shore jets, their variability, together with the wind-induced Ekman drift. Transport success is most efficient in spring when the Benguela Jet consists of one coherent intensified single-core branch that flows over the 300 m isobath, and when wind-induced Ekman transport favours the retention of particles within the jet. At this time of the year, the pathway leading to successful transport is located inshore, with 90% of particles released inshore the 300 m isobath being successfully transported to St Helena Bay in < 15 days. This pathway is also characterized by low eddy kinetic energy values.During the upwelling season (December March), transport success becomes less efficient, and less sensitive to the initial across-shore position of the particles. The inshore route no longer dominates, as the majority of particles follow offshore pathways. The Benguela Jet shifts offshore and splits into several branches due to the shoaling of the poleward undercurrent. The entrainment of particles within the offshore branch of the jet is favored by the dominating offshore wind-induced Ekman transport. Particles trapped in the offshore branch get exposed to higher mesoscale variability. Their northward progression is slower, which leads to journeys generally exceeding 20 days.This study shows that successful transport from the Agulhas Bank to the west coast upwelling region cannot be attributed to only a simple wind induced modulation of the jet. It explores how the seasonal modulation of the Benguela Jet, poleward undercurrent and offshore Ekman transport combine together with the turbulent off shelf eddy field to set-up the characteristics of transport success.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,1,7,,,0924-7963,1879-1573,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Brest, CNRS, IFREMER, LOPS,IUEM,IRD, Brest, FranceUniv Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, Cape Town, South AfricaSAEON, Egagasini Node, Cape Town, South Africa",,,,2019-05-27,WOS:000467667000005,,
J,,,,,,,,,"Tyugin,Dmitry",,Creation of a high-performance software package and a full range of support tools for computational experiment on multiprocessor systems for modeling the dynamics of internal waves in a stratified ocean and analyzing their role in natural and technogenic processes occurring on the shelf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jul 01 2017,2017,"This project is aimed at the development of an open source software package for studying hydrodynamic processes in a stratified ocean by numerical simulations on multiprocessor systems. It is proposed to create a modern adapted and verified software tool for solving the applied geophysical problem related to the study of internal gravity waves in the shelf zone of the seas and oceans, as well as the processes of mixing, impurity transport, erosion of bottom material and power loads on underwater facilities caused by them, based both on the application of known analytical methods for estimating the parameters of internal waves, and on the numerical simulation with the help of international models transformation of long waves in horizontally and vertically inhomogeneous basins. The topicality of the software development is determined by the need to create and demand an effective tool optimized for solving a whole class of problems within the mathematical modeling of processes induced by internal waves in the ocean. The possibility of effective computations in this area is extremely relevant for the strategic evolution of the country, as it affects the estimation of risks and the prevention of anthropogenic disasters during the construction of oil platforms and the conduct of economic activities when developing the natural resources of the shelf zone. Scientific novelty is confirmed by the lack of developments that contain a full range of support tools for computational experiment for a whole class of problems of this type. To describe the generation and propagation of internal waves, there are several models that can be applied to the results of laboratory experiments and to real environmental conditions. One class of models is based on direct numerical integration of complete, as a rule, two-dimensional in space non-linear systems of Navier-Stokes (Euler) equations. However, these models require large computational costs, and the inclusion of additional external factors such as the field of currents and the horizontal variability of hydrological fields is difficult, since it leads to the need to consider the third spatial coordinate. Another class of internal waves models is based on the application of a weakly nonlinear long-wave theory. In this case, the evolution and transformation of long (in comparison with the depth of the liquid) internal waves is described using a one-dimensional evolution equation. In the first order this is the well-known Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV). Its coefficients are determined by the vertical distribution of the density and horizontal shear flow, and also by the conditions on the surface. The Korteweg-de Vries equation and its generalizations have already been used to analyze the transformation of internal waves on many oceanic shelves and have shown their effectiveness. Moreover, the second class of models is much simpler, since these models are based on the one-dimensional evolution equation in space (along the horizontal coordinate), and the vertical structure of the wave field is determined by the solution of linear boundary value problems. Their advantages also include the fact that models of the Korteweg-de Vries type, unlike full nonlinear models, are easily generalized for a horizontally inhomogeneous fluid (when the density stratification and shear flow velocity profile vary in space), leading to an equation of the same form, but with the variable coefficients along the horizontal coordinate. It is also possible to use models based on the Korteweg-de Vries equation, in combination with the ray theory for internal waves, when the evolution equation is written along the ray coordinate, and thus a three-dimensional picture of the wave field can be obtained. During the project implementation, a software package will be developed. It will combine the implementation of numerical models of all the approaches listed above (KdV-class and full-line ones) for describing the dynamics of wave processes in a stratified ocean, mathematical models of particle transport (liquid, impurity, suspended matter) and the dynamics of surface- active substances in stratified flows, methods for estimating forces and moments on hydraulic facilities, as well as tools to perform numerical experiment. These tools will bring ability to conduct such stages as data preparation on heterogeneous grids, combining and adapting data for numerical models, including nested grids, sampling, visualization and data analysis tools for initializing numerical models, and a verification database for conducting validation of mathematical models. An important feature of the software package will be the integration with the online database of solitary internal waves observations, containing information about the characteristics and place of registration of real observations of internal waves. Such functionality is necessary to confirm the reliability of the obtained modeling results. The next step will be the adaptation of the program code for integration into the cluster infrastructure. This approach is important when solving the problem of increasing the effectiveness of research. Cloud computing and the development of parallel algorithms are a common practice in conducting resource-intensive calculations. Thus, the ability of transferring the experiment to a cluster will bring the software to a global technological level. The author's experience in the implementation of the IGWResearch software in this area lets draw a conclusion about the demand for such developments in the scientific community (Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Special Research Bureau for Automation of Marine Researches, Far Eastern Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Cybernetics and Marine Systems Department of Tallinn Technical University), and feedback from the users of the software package revealed the need for a more powerful tool containing new models, additions and tools. One of the key advantages of the software package will be the availability of an ergonomic user interface, developed considering the author's current developments in the field of industrial programming [1] and the current trends in software systems. Thus, the development of an open-source software package that covers the entire range of modeling tasks in the vertical plane of a stratified ocean in the context of internal waves, taking into account adaptation to freely accessible hydrological data and distributed free of charge, will allow a new step in mathematical modeling in this area. 1.

In contrast, high A. fundyense abundances and PSP toxicity commonly occur later in the summer in the eastern GOM and the Bay of Fundy. The objective of this study was to determine if the bloom dynamics of the two areas are linked early in the bloom season when initial outbreaks of toxicity are reported. A. fundyense cell abundance and hydrographic data were acquired during three cruises in May and June, 2001 spanning areas of the western and eastern GOM. Surface drifters also were released into the nearshore coastal flow of the eastern GOM. These data provide a coherent view of the springtime evolution of toxic A. fundyense blooms in the GOM and the influence of both small- and large-scale circulation. Early in the bloom season (May), the bulk of the A. fundyense population was consistently observed in an alongshore band of cells in the eastern GOM associated with relatively low-salinity water ( < 32) that likely originated from inputs further upstream in the coastal flow, predominantly the St. John River in the Bay of Fundy. At that time, the western GOM was virtually devoid of cells. In June, the population was bifurcated, with one branch extending alongshore into the western GOM and the other into the offshore waters of the interior GOM. This pattern was consistent with circulation models of the coastal GOM that unambiguously revealed a bifurcated flow with the branch nearest the coast directed alongshore to the western GOM. The most significant finding of this study is that A. fundyense populations along the eastern Maine coast were delivered along an inside track relative to the core of the eastern segment of the Maine Coastal Current. The transport pathway carried cells across the mouth of Penobscot Bay and into the western GOM coincident with outbreaks of nearshore PSP toxicity. The transport is influenced by wind. In particular, some of the cells within the nearshore flow may be lost to the interior GOM when upwelling- favorable winds transport them offshore and into the large-scale circulation dominated by the cyclonic flow of the Jordan Basin Gyre. Downwelling-favorable winds keep the cells close to the coast and rapidly transport them into the western GOM. This study unequivocally demonstrates the linkage between early season A. fundyense bloom formation in the eastern GOM and blooms in the western GOM. It also indicates that the lack of toxicity along the mid-Maine coast commonly referred to as the PSP sandwich may be an artifact of the lack of shellfish sampling along the outer remote islands of Penobscot Bay, as populations sufficient to cause toxicity can be found adjacent to the coastline. The association of the A. fundyense populations with low-salinity water near, the coast requires a refinement of the terminology for the eastern Maine Coastal Current to distinguish this nearshore water mass from the adjacent. more saline offshore waters. We name this feature the Gulf of Maine Coastal Plume (GOMCP) to reflect the freshwater inputs into the GOM that are critically important in the long-distance transport and growth of A. fundyense populations along the New England coast. The GOMCP is likely to be important for other organisms as well. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Cleanup personnel have recognized that remote sensing can increase spill cleanup efficiency. The general public expects that the government and/or the spiller know the location and the extent of the contamination. The Emergencies Science Division (ESD) of Environment Canada, (Canadian government department), is responsible for remote sensing during oil spill emergencies along Canada's three coastlines, extensive inland waterways, as well as over the entire land mass. In addition to providing operational remote sensing, ESD conducts research into the development of airborne oil spill remote sensors, including the Scanning Laser Environmental Airborne Fluorosensor (SLEAF) and the Laser Ultrasonic Remote Sensing of Oil Thickness (LURSOT) sensor. It has long been recognized that there is no one sensor or ''Magic Bullet'' which is capable of detecting oil and related petroleum products in all environments and spill scenarios. There are sensors which possess a wide field-of-view (FOV) and can therefore be used to map the overall extent of the spill. These sensors, however lack the specificity required to positively identify oil and related products. This is even more of a problem along complicated beach and shoreline environments where several substrates are present.The specific laser-based sensors under development by Environment Canada are designed to respond to special roles in oil spill response, In particular, the Scanning Laser Environmental Airborne Fluorosensor is being developed to unambiguously detect and map oil and related petroleum products in complicated marine and shoreline environments where other non-specific sensors experience difficulty. The role of the SLEAF would be to confirm or reject suspected oil contamination sites that have been targeted bl: the non-specific sensors. This confirmation will release response crews from the lime consuming task of physically inspecting each site. and direct crews to sites that require remediation. The Laser Ultrasonic Remote Sensing of Oil Thickness (LURSOT) sensor will provide an absolute measurement of oil thickness from an airborne platform There are presently no sensors available, either airborne or in the laboratory which can provide an absolute measurement of oil thickness. This information is necessary for the effective direction of spill countermeasures such as dispersant application and in-situ burning.This paper will describe the development of laser-based airborne oil spill remote sensing instrumentation at Environment Canada and identify the anticipated benefits of the use of this technology to the oil spill response community.",,,,,Conference on Remote Sensing of Vegetation and SeaConference on Remote Sensing of Vegetation and Sea,"SEP 23-26, 1996SEP 23-26, 1996","CNR; Ctr Natl Etud Spatiales; City Taormina; Univ Catania, Dept Bot; Italian Assoc Remote Sensing; European Opt Soc; Soc Photo Opt Instrumentat Engineers; Commiss European Communities, Directorate Gen Sci Res & DevCNR; Ctr Natl Etud Spatiales; City Taormina; Univ Catania, Dept Bot; Italian Assoc Remote Sensing; European Opt Soc; Soc Photo Opt Instrumentat Engineers; Commiss European Communities, Directorate Gen Sci Res & Dev","TAORMINA, ITALYTAORMINA, ITALY",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,0-8194-2363-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,1997-01-01,WOS:A1997BH14X00020,,

Results (a) confirm that a year of extreme toxicity (2005) differs from recent years but show it to be similar to strongly toxic years of the late 19805, (b) show 3 year-groups, 1980s-early 1990s of high toxicity, mid-1990s-early 2000s of lower toxicity, and 2004-2005 similar to the early years, and (c) show temporal autocorrelation suggesting that processes carrying from year to year are important in controlling toxicity. Multivariate statistics then group stations according to interannual co-variability. Resulting station-groups show strong regionality consistent with known hydrographic and circulation patterns and identify stations that differ from their neighbors. Annual means calculated within station-groups provide 21-year time series that are cross-correlated with concurrent monthly environmental metrics of Gulf of Maine oceanographic conditions calculated from field measurements, satellite data and numerical circulation model hindcasts. These analyses provide three main results. First, toxicity time series show an overall pattern of elevated magnitudes and increased duration in the 1980s, minimum values in the mid-late 1990s and then increasing again in the 2000s. Second, only station-groups geographically located in the western portion of the study area have correlations with any tested environmental metric. Third, toxicity in many western station-groups was positively correlated to interannual variability in early season (April-May) wind stress driving onshore Ekman transport, negatively correlated with summer (June-July) wind stress driving offshore Ekman transport and negatively correlated with summer (June-July) cross-shelf surface temperature gradients indicative of relatively warm coastal surface temperature patterns, consistent with patterns expected from the wind transport correlations. The data do not show significant correlation between station-group toxicity and along-shelf temperature structure (an indicator of fronts and alongshore flow connection), river discharge, surface temperature anomalies, modeled surface salinities or alongshore current velocities. These data provide a quantitative summary of Maine coastal toxicity over 21 years, a spatial toxicity geography and isolate dominant environmental forcing responsible for interannual variability.

Despite certain differences in status, all these waters are united by being part of the Russian territory. They differ from the waters that are not part of the territory of the state, but are above the continental shelf of the Russian Federation; these are the waters of the exclusive economic zone of the Russian Federation, and the open sea waters start beyond the 200-mile distance from the baseline. Even in the latter case, since a platform is stationary on the continental shelf of the Russian Federation, it is within the exclusive criminal jurisdiction of the Russian Federation. Counteraction to crimes infringing of the security of platforms fixed to the seabed includes a wide range of legal and organizational-legal measures. Besides, an important part is played by the special norms of international and national laws, including the criminal legislation of the state that has jurisdiction over the water body where a fixed platform is located. This article presents suggestions on improving Russian criminal legislation taking into account Russia's participation in the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf of 1988, other applicable norms of international law, the necessity to observe international law obligations and protect the national interests of the country. The authors suggest that unlawful acts of seizing a fixed platform or other violent actions infringing on the security of this object, the security of personnel operating it, aimed at forcing a state or an organization which is legally operating this object to perform or abstain form certain actions, and resulting in the intimidation of the population should be specifically included in the national criminal law as a separate type of terrorism crimes. The authors also recommend to add the norms on criminal liability for other unlawful, criminally punishable acts (which are not acts of terrorism and do not have the features of terrorism), including the attempts of illegal entry into a fixed platform or hindering its operation, to Chapter 24 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation Crimes against Public Safety as a separate Article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation among the norms regarding crimes that violate the security of the functioning of potentially dangerous objects (potentially dangerous operations). They recommend to use the most successful international legal experience to improve corporate acts within the framework of Russian legislation through the content specification of the scope and type of rights and obligations of business entities, including the relationships of the fixed platform's personnel with the law enforcement bodies with the purpose of a more effective inclusion of business entities in the system of measures of preventing and suppressing illegal interference in the functioning of fixed platforms in the Russian waters.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2500-4255,2500-1442,,,,,,,,,,"Moscow State Inst Int Relat Univ, Minist Foreign Affairs Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia",,,,2020-05-19,WOS:000531006600013,,

A previously conducted velocity and AVO analysis of the in-situ seismic data showed that the BSR separates hydrate-bearing sediments from sediments containing free methane. The amplitudes at the BSR are increasingly negative with increasing offset. This behavior was explained by P-wave velocity above the BSR being larger than that below the BSR, and S-wave velocity above the BSR being smaller than that below the BSR. We use these AVO and velocity results to infer the internal structure of the hydrated sediment. To do so, we examine two micromechanical models that correspond to the two extreme cases of hydrate deposition in the pore space: (1) the hydrate cements grain contacts and strongly reinforces the sediment, and (2) the hydrate is located away from grain contacts and does not affect the stiffness of the sediment frame. Only the second model can qualitatively reproduce the observed AVO response. Thus inferred internal structure of the hydrate-bearing sediment means that (1) the sediment above the BSR is uncemented and, thereby, mechanically weak, and (2) its permeability is very low because the hydrate clogs large pore-space conduits. The latter explains why free gas is trapped underneath the BSR. The seismic data also indicate the absence of strong reflections at the top of the hydrate layer. This fact suggests that the high concentration of hydrates in the sediment just above the BSR gradually decreases with decreasing depth. This effect is consistent with the fact that the low-permeability hydrated sediments above the BSR prevent free methane from migrating upwards.",,,,,,,,,247,40,1,0,9,1,287,,,0016-8033,1942-2156,,,,,,,,,,"Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,,1998-09-01,WOS:000076285600019,,

The empirical setting is the process of construction of a new system around ocean energy technologies and its contribution to the development of the sea economy in Portugal. The project combines theoretical and empirical contributions from socio-technical transitions and economic geography to contextualise the development of the new system and investigate the nature and effects of its interactions with the context where it evolves. It focuses on the transformative potential of the co-evolution of the emerging system with contiguous sectors - i.e. existing sectors not initially involved with the technology that offer complementary competences - as processes of recombination of new and existing knowledge into new configurations may be enacted along such co-evolution, ultimately leading to the transformation of these sectors. To understand these processes requires moving beyond the usual focus on the new system and also addressing the process from the standpoint of context actors. This involves examining how system actors mobilize context actors and how the latter perceive and respond to it; and investigating the processes that take place along their interaction, the effects at both levels and the conditions that influence them. These processes are also contextualised in space to investigate the implications of their multi-scalar nature and its effects on regional development.The empirical analysis addresses the past trajectory and current situation in Portugal of two technologies - wave energy and offshore wind - and is complemented with a comparative analysis with Norway. It combines an assessment of the dynamics of interactions at system level, with an in-depth analysis of actors' behaviour, and includes three cases studies of technologies that consistently conducted experiments in specific locations. The results will unveil factors that explain: the engagement, alignment and competence upgrading of contiguous complementary sectors; processes of recombination of previous unrelated knowledge carried out by different actors and their implications for regions where such processes (partly) occur. The results contribute to a theoretical discussion on the modes of conduction of sustainable transitions and also to debates on (un)relatedness in firm and regional diversification. They will be widely disseminated to relevant stakeholders and support the design of policy mixes that aim at inducing pervasive effects in the economy, promoting a sustained industrial diversification.

Although isolated mesoscale eddies have previously been documented for this eastern boundary region, the composite image provides the first evidence that trains of such eddies can develop simultaneously along the entire coast. The 80 km radius and 250 km spacing of these warm-core eddies are consistent with a baroclinic instability event in the poleward coastal current that prevails along the northwest continental margin of North America in winter (roughly October through March). Wind data from offshore meteorological buoys, combined with partial cloud-free thermal images for January and February, suggest that the event was triggered in mid January by an abrupt, coast-wide reversal in the prevailing poleward wind. The instability event disrupted the alongshore transport of relatively warm, high-salinity water and presumably resulted in a greatly enhanced cross-shore flux of brackish, nutrient-rich coastal water into the open ocean. On the basis of its basin-scale extent and more than 2 month duration it is feasible that the event had a major impact on the early spring recruitment and survival of zooplankton and pelagic fish within the highly productive fishery zones of coastal British Columbia and Alaska. Less extensive eddy sequences found in several earlier satellite images for the region suggest that these instability events are fairly common. If so, this indicates that the poleward current that forms over the eastern Pacific continental slope in late fall (herein, the Northeast Pacific Coastal Current) is marginally stable and likely to deform into a series of mesoscale eddies following abrupt, basin-scale reversals in the seasonally dominant wind. Provided these wind events occur early enough in the season, the coastal current could reform with the onset of poleward winter winds.",,,,,,,,,83,0,0,0,15,1,93,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Fisheries Oceans Canada Inst Ocean Sci, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada",,,,1998-02-15,WOS:000072115500017,,

The aim is to develop a floating-bridge type 15 kW-class small horizontal axis tidal current turbine. As part of the research for the reduced model experiment of hydrofoils, a 50 W-class horizontal axis tidal current turbine model was investigated. Therefore, for this study, blade design was carried out using two different hydrofoils (MNU26 and NACA63421). Performance and hydrodynamic characteristics are investigated by using computational fluid dynamics and experimental methods. Among the two blades, NACA63421 blade showed the best power coefficient at low Reynolds number, whereas MNU26 blade performed better for higher Reynolds number. The MNU26 hydrofoil was applied to the blade design from the previous study. The MNU26 hydrofoil has a 26% thickness in contrast to the NACA63421, which has a 21% thickness. This indicates that the MNU26 can be applied throughout the blade length for the 15 kW-class turbine whilst providing good structural strength. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Our view of the landscape, and the actions we take to use and value it, are steered by a complex mix of factors, many of which are often unconscious. Some of these factors are related to the rise of technology-mediated experiences changing the way we interact with nature, whilst others are imposed on us when decisions have to be made about resource management and sustainable urbanisation. Increasingly, decision-makers are gathering around issues about the Earth, our environment and the nexus with society, Do we want fracking or wind farms in this place?; Should a mine be opened or closed?; Should we bury our waste here?; Are we doing enough about climate change? Addressing these complex questions requires a holistic approach to both understanding the problem and the actions we take to solve it. Decision-making requires an evidence base, but this has to be greater than the sum of its parts, requiring knowledge across seemingly disparate aspects of science and society. This project aims to contribute to an evidence base to support decision making about landscape, as well as open up dialogue about the contribution and importance of the arts in environmental research. Increasingly, local-to-global challenges are being addressed by integrating knowledge from seemingly disparate disciplines, including the arts, even if collaborations between artists and 'other' researchers are slow to be endorsed. In this project, collaborating artists and geoscientists will develop new ways of working and co-create new artworks. Their focus is on the evolution of Scotland's landscape, particularly the balance between landscape conservation and adaptation to changing culture, communities and societal needs.On the surface, the core creative team of this project may seem an unlikely grouping to develop an arts-based network - a volcanologist, marine geoscientist and a soil hydrologist. Yet all three are practicing artists, and regularly use creative approaches to develop and communicate their research. The team are collaborating with award-winning contemporary sculpture park, Jupiter Artland, and Edinburgh's science centre, Dynamic Earth, to develop a network of artists and geoscientists and undertake innovative transdisciplinary activities to inspire participants to think, learn, and create in unfamiliar territories.

The OWC spar-buoy is an axisymmetric device consisting of a submerged vertical tail tube open at both ends, rigidly fixed to a floater that moves essentially in heave. The oscillating motion of the internal free surface relative to the floater-tube set, produced by the incident waves, makes the air flow through a novel self-rectifying air turbine: the biradial turbine. To reduce the losses of the PTO system at partial load, an electrical generator with a rated power twice the maximum expected average power conversion of the buoy was adopted. The control of the turbine-generator set under highly energetic sea-state conditions was experimentally investigated by means of tests performed in a PTO test rig. In the reported tests, the hydrodynamics of the OWC spar-buoy and the aerodynamics of the air turbine were numerically simulated in real-time and coupled with the experimental model of the turbine/electrical generator set in a hardware-in-the-loop configuration. The experimental results allowed the dynamic behaviour of the PTO to be characterized and provided validation of the proposed control algorithms that ensure operation within safe limits.

Due to the general heterogeneity of carbonate reservoirs, the use of an integrated approach is helpful for investigating porosity and permeability distribution along with recognizing controlling pore system factors in the reservoir. Thus, for the reservoir characterization of the Mishrif Fm., an integrated approach including facies analysis, diagenetic history and sequence stratigraphic analysis is considered. Detailed petrographic studies showed a total of eight microfacies and seven facies belts, related to inner ramp to the basin of a homoclinal carbonate ramp. Humid climatic condition and tectonic activity, associated with eustatic sea-level fluctuations during the mid-Cretaceous, led to meteoric diagenesis of the Mishrif carbonates during subaerial exposures (mid-Cenomanian and Cenomanian-Turonian disconformities). General diagenetic overprints and modifications include micritization, cementation, dissolution, compaction, dolomitization, pyritization and fracturing. Considering this reservoir in the sequence stratigraphic framework reveals that the reservoir zones development is basically related to the Cenomanian-Turonian sequence boundary, recognized in the three studied wells, and also to the mid-Cenomanian boundary, identified only in one well. In addition, pore system properties were inspected by differentiation of Hydraulic Flow Units (HFUs) within the reservoir. The identified flow units, based on their capability for fluid flow, can be classified into four main rock types with very high- (HFUD), high- (HFUC), medium- (HFUB) and low-quality (HFUA). Accordingly, this study shows that the main part of the Mishrif Reservoir is affected by diagenetic processes related to subaerial exposures, resulting in zones with higher storage capacity and fluid flow rates. So, the study of depositional and diagenetic characteristics of the Mishrif carbonates in the sequence stratigraphy framework is essential to unravel the reservoir heterogeneity, and to describe the reservoir zones and their distribution in the field and regional scale.

ACCessibility for Shipping, Efficiency Advantages and Sustainability (ACCSEAS) aims to identify issues which obstruct maritime access to the North Sea, identify solutions, prototype and demonstrate these successful solutions in an e-Navigation test-bed at the North Sea regional level as 'proof-of-concept' and to develop a sustainability plan for future e-Navigation provision in the NSR and will look to inform e-Navigation initiative globally The entire process of the implementation of prototype solutions in the e-Navigation test-bed will be supported by training and simulation, so that the test-bed will have aspects of both real-world and simulated implementation. The project is part funded through the European Regional Development Fund's INTERREG IVB NSR initiative. European transport policy provides a shift to seaborne transport, using Short Sea Shipping to avoid road bottle necks to the movement of goods, services and people. This modal shift requires efficient and effective marine navigation services. The NSR, as a maritime hub, is at risk from increased shipping congestion and transport delays, safety issues and pollution/environmental risks that would inhibit the socio-economic development of the NSR. This is exacerbated by the proliferation of offshore installations (such as wind farms) for renewable energy.Globally, there is a trend towards larger bulk cargo and container carrying ships, which operate side-by-side with fishing boats and leisure craft in the same congested waters. Without the innovative services of e-Navigation, berth-to-berth operations may become less efficient. There may be increased risk of collisions and groundings, adversely impacting accessibility of ports and the effectiveness of logistics in the region. Consequences could be severe in terms of reduced economic sustainability, more environmental pollution incidents and the threat to safety-of-life.The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) concept of e-Navigation, formally recognised by the EU and the US, provides a potential solution via harmonised, integrated and exchangeable electronic maritime information on-board and ashore. The NSR, as a crossroads of regional and global shipping, is well positioned to benefit from an implementation of e-Navigation that can increase the efficient use of resources, provide better voyage planning and track-keeping and deliver improvements in regional accessibility.ACCSEAS aims to implement and demonstrate e-Navigation systems to alleviate NSR navigation risks. The aim of ACCSEAS is to identify issues which obstruct maritime access to the NSR, identify solutions, pilot and then demonstrate these successful solutions at regional level to develop a strategy for future e-Navigation provision. ACCSEAS builds on findings of previous and currently implemented related European projects and the ACCSEAS partnership includes several partners from those projects, allowing a smooth, efficient coordination between the projects and ensuring work is seamless without overlap.A regional e-Navigation service for the North Sea inherently requires a transnational approach. Improved maritime access can only be achieved by closer cooperation between competent authorities, navigation service providers and maritime stakeholders which encompasses: technology, infrastructure, services and operations within the broad policy, guidance and regulatory frame work of the European Union (EU), the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) and IMO. ACCSEAS is a transnational project that brings together Beneficiaries (including competent navigation authorities from Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom).The North Sea presents unique challenges that will demand unique solutions both at priority locations and at the regional scale. Only through the NSR and the ACCSEAS project specifically, can the maritime administrations in the region be coordinated to address implementation of the e-Navigation solution to accessibility and to integrate with regional research providers, training organisations and suppliers.ACCSEAS produces four types of results and outputs: firstly, a practical test bed (real equipment and infrastructure in the form of e-Navigation prototypes and complementary simulations to test these); secondly, a database of information which demonstrates the effectiveness of the prototypes, primarily in the form of baseline information concerning vessel routes in the NSR and Coverage Maps of the geographical extent in the NSR of e-Navigation services for the prototypes that improve safe and efficient regional accessibility. This information will be stored within an ACCSEAS Geographical Information System (GIS); thirdly, 'system of systems engineering' documentation concerning maritime access issues in the NSR, how the e-Navigation Prototypes and Simulations were developed to address these and an assessment of best practices involved in establishing e-Navigation regional solutions; fourthly, analysis of the lessons learned, advice and training needs for practical e-Navigation solutions; with training modules developed from this analysis.By the completion of the project in 2015, the ACCSEAS Partnership will have undertaken all activities to produce validated real world prototypes and simulations (validated by test/demonstrations to satisfy user requirements) including: a ship positioning unit and terrestrial Back-up; ship-to-shore based communications; e-Navigation services on ship and shore. The project should also have put in place a structure for co-ordination of future e-Navigation development across the NSR. The structure will comprise a road map for service expansion and a plan for the sustainability and harmonisation of e-Navigation in NSR.The prototypes, systems engineering lessons and training information will advise the further extension of e-Navigation across the NSR using a sustainability plan and roadmap. The results and outputs will allow the e-Navigation Architecture developed in the NSR by ACCSEAS to be readily transferable to other EU regions and internationally. To achieve the transferability of outputs and results, ACCSEAS will disseminate information about the project to users, stakeholders, competent authorities, ports, policy and decision makers at national, regional European and International levels.",,,,,25th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite-Division of the Institute-of-Navigation25th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite-Division of the Institute-of-Navigation,"SEP 17-21, 2012SEP 17-21, 2012","Inst Nav, Satellite DivInst Nav, Satellite Div","Nashville, TNNashville, TN",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2331-5911,2331-5954,*****************,,,,,,,,,,,,,2013-12-25,WOS:000327163303067,,

This paper presents a genetic programming (GP) based approach to identifying the primary cause of oyster norovirus outbreaks and predicting oyster norovirus outbreaks in order to reduce the risks. In terms of the primary cause, it was found that oyster norovirus outbreaks were controlled by cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions characterized by low solar radiation, low water temperature, low gage height (the height of water above a gage datum), low salinity, heavy rainfall, and strong offshore wind. The six environmental variables were determined by using Random Forest (RF) and Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) methods within the framework of the GP approach. In terms of predicting norovirus outbreaks, a risk-based GP model was developed using the six environmental variables and various combinations of the variables with different time lags. The results of local and global sensitivity analyses showed that gage height, temperature, and solar radiation were by far the three most important environmental predictors for oyster norovirus outbreaks, though other variables were also important. Specifically, very low temperature and gage height significantly increased the risk of norovirus outbreaks while high solar radiation markedly reduced the risk, suggesting that low temperature and gage height were associated with the norovirus source while solar radiation was the primary sink of norovirus. The GP model was utilized to hindcast daily risks of oyster norovirus outbreaks along the Northern Gulf of Mexico coast. The daily hindcasting results indicated that the GP model was capable of hindcasting all historical oyster norovirus outbreaks from January 2002 to June 2014 in the Gulf of Mexico with only two false positive outbreaks for the 12.5-year period. The performance of the GP model was characterized with the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.86, the true positive rate (sensitivity) of 78.53% and the true negative rate (specificity) of 88.82%, respectively, demonstrating the efficacy of the GP model. The findings and results offered new insights into the oyster norovirus outbreaks in terms of source, sink, cause, and predictors. The GP model provided an efficient and effective tool for predicting potential oyster norovirus outbreaks and implementing management interventions to prevent or at least reduce norovirus risks to both the human health and the seafood industry.

Hence protection requirement of a wind mill was just restricted to simple current and voltage based measurement.This paper identifies the areas of concern where proper protection has to be introduced apart from the basic wind park requirements. Owing to the increase in the demand for renewable energy large wind parks are constructed in deep seas. Such wind parks are connected to the electrical grid on the land by comprehensive underground cables. the underground cables are a potential for a fault occurence.The next area of concern would be in the multiple mechanically switched capacitor banks or FACTS used for dynamic reactive compensation. The voltage flicker produced by large wind parks owing to the varying speed of the wind mills on the interconnected grid has a deteriorating effect on the other connected equipment and also on the grid as well. To maintain voltage stability as per NERC guidelines and to mitigate voltage flickers, dynamic reactive compensation can be provided with multiple mechanically switched capacitor banks or FACTS.Therefore the paper will discuss in detail the protection possibilities for the underground cables and the reactors for large wind parks located offshore.",,,,,Power System Conference 2009Power System Conference 2009,"MAR 10-13, 2009MAR 10-13, 2009",Clemson UnivClemson Univ,"Clemson, SCClemson, SC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-4244-5248-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000278483600017,,

The various structures have distinct characteristics that make the nanotubes suitable for various physical applications. It is due their unique electrical, mechanical and thermal attributes CNTs present thrilling opportunities for mechanical engineering, industrial, scientific research and commercial applications. There is fruitful potential for carbon nanotubes in the composites business and industry. Today, CNTs find utilization in frequent various products, and analyst continue to explore new applications. Currently applications comprise wind turbines, bicycle components, scanning probe microscopes, flat panel displays, marine paints, sensing devices, electronics, batteries with longer lifetime and electrical circuitry etc. Such applications in mind, entropy optimized dissipative CNTs based flow of nanomaterial by a stretched surface. Flow is caused due to stretching phenomenon and studied in 3D coordinates. Both types of CNTs are studied i.e., SWCNTs and MWCNTs. CNTs are considered for nanoparticles and water for continuous phase fluid. Special consideration is given to the analysis of statistical declaration and probable error for skin friction and Nusselt number. Furthermore, entropy rate is calculated. Entropy rate is discussed in the presence of four main irreversibilities i.e., heat transfer, Joule heating, porosity and dissipation.Method: Homotopy technique is utilized to develop the convergence series solutions.Results: Impacts of sundry variables subject to both SWCNTs (single) and MWCNTs (multi) are graphically discussed. Statistical analysis and probable error for surface drag force and Nusselt number are numerically calculated subject to various flow variables. Numerical results for such engineering quantities are displayed through tables. In addition, comparative analysis for SWCNTs and MWCNTs are presented for the velocity, concentration and thermal fields.Conclusions: Results for entropy rate is calculated in the presence of various sundry variable through implementation of second law of thermodynamics. It is examined from the results that velocity decreases for both CNTs via higher magnetic, inertia coefficient and porosity parameters. Secondary velocity i.e., velocity in g-direction boosts up versus rotation parameter while it declines for larger slip parameter for both CNTs. thermal field intensifies for both CNTs via larger heat generation/absorption parameter. Concentration which shows the mass transfer of species increases subject to higher homogeneous parameter and Schmidt number in case of both CNTs. Entropy rate in more for larger magnetic, Reynolds number and slip parameter. Bejan number boosts up for higher Reynold number and slip parameter while it declines for magnetic parameter.

There are abundant oil shale resources in Northwest China. Our analysis of field geological section surveys, standard mining investigations, and the laboratory analysis of important samples indicate that the oil shale in Northwest China is characterized by the following features: oil shale strata is 1-36 m thick, the color of slightly greasy, shiny and flaky oil shale is mostly brown-black, black with light brown streaks, but some oil shale outcrops appear maroon. Oil shale is of layered structure, irregular shape, conchoidal fracture, and low hardness, composed mainly of clay and silt-sized detrital minerals (feldspar and quartz). SiO(2) and Al(2)O(3) comprise a total of 52.54% of the rock, this indicates that oil shale is of the medium ash type. Organic carbon content of oil shale is 14% and that of total carbon 16.28%. Oil yield is generally 1.5-13.7%, overall caloric value 1.66-20.98 MJ/kg. Density of oil shale is 1.55-2.46 g/cc. Younger oil shale strata are characterized by progressively higher REE abundances. There are mainly three types of oil shale deposits: the littoral-neritic facies sedimentary deposits of the Middle and Upper Carboniferous - the Lower Permian, remnant lake bay-lacustrine facies sedimentary deposits of the Upper Permian, and shale which formed in inland deep water - half deep water lacustrine facies of the Mesozoic, the latter being of the major industrial type, and its origin is similar to the Black Sea model. Oil shale layers are also the main oil source rock in the Ordos Basin. Oil shale layers which formed in deltaic environments in the Middle and Late Carboniferous and the Jurassic are mostly paragenetically related to coal beds. In the area, the total amount of predicted resources of oil shale is at least 31,000 x 10(8) t which is equivalent to about 2000 x 10(8) t of shale oil. Oil shale resources in the Ordos Basin account for 99% of the total and can be compared to oil shale resources in the Green River area of western North America. In Northwest China, the identified oil shale deposits are located in the vicinity of large and medium-sized cities, with good development prospects.

J,,,,,,,,,"John, George",,RAPID: Sugar-based Recyclable Phase-Selective Gelators for Oil Spill Remediation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 01 2010,2010,"1046099 John The blowout of an oil well in the Gulf of Mexico is set to cover 120 miles of coastline and hence tremendously affect the ecosystem. The scale of such disasters has highlighted the need for effective and eco-friendly materials to contain oil spills. Here in, the investigators propose the sugar based environmentally benign phase-selective gelation agents for efficient containment of oil spills and recovery of oil as well. Phase selective oil gelators (PSGs), when added to an oil/water mixture, selectively partition into the oil phase and convert it into a gel. The proposal builds on recent preliminary results where a class of sugar amphiphiles derived from mannitol (an open chain sugar) has shown to be capable of selectively gel several oils. As shown in the image, the obtained oil gel (diesel gel) can be strong enough to hold not just its weight but also that of the water on top in the inverted vial. Selective gelation of diesel from bulk diesel water mixture and simultaneous recovery of diesel, with 80% efficiency, was demonstrated. Hence, they can be potential alternatives to the current oil spill remediation techniques. Therefore, we propose a) to conduct a comprehensive (fundamental and applied) study into the phenomenon of phase selective molecular gelation in relation to open chain sugar amphiphiles and b) to obtain design parameters (rationale) for optimizing the amphiphilic structure for better selective gelation ability and efficient oil spill clean up. Intellectual Merit: The investigators focus on the fundamental science behind the phenomenon of phase selective gelation pertaining to oil spill applications. The goal is to construct rationale for generating bio-based PTh. The PIs hypothesize that open chain sugar head groups and hydrogen bonding interactions are likely to be important for selective gelation of oils. Hence, amphiphilic structure will be accordingly varied to obtain design parameters. The nanostructure of phase selective gels (characterized by TEM, SEM, and cryo-TEM) and intermolecular interactions in the gel (probed by spectroscopic techniques) will be systematically related to amphiphilic structure. Broader Impact: The broader scientific impact will be the applications afforded by the inexpensive and eco-friendly phase selective gelators to be synthesized in this project. The phase selective gelation of oil from a mixture of oil and water could be a viable approach for the containment and remediation of oil spills on the ocean. In addition, the availability of phase selective gelators may allow engineers and scientists to devise ingenious uses for these molecules. The PI will also integrate their research with educational and mentoring activities.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1046099,,,,,,,,CUNY City College,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13770316,,

One main reason for the scientific interest in composite materials is their tailorable mechanical properties. However, because of the fiber-direction dependent nature of its physical and mechanical properties, composite material's property and failure behaviors are usually complex, typically involving various mechanisms depending on applications. Nondestructive testing plays a key role during composite fabrication and maintenance in service. Among the variety of nondestructive techniques available, ultrasound phased array technique has emerged as a promising new approach. Unlike a conventional ultrasound single element transducer, an ultrasound phased array sensor can control and focus acoustic energy to the desired directions and locations. This heightened flexibility and sensitivity is essential given complex shape of modern composite structures. Despite such promise, understanding and application of ultrasound phased array technique is limited due to the anisotropic nature of composite materials, as well as its high acoustic attenuation. Attenuation and velocity dispersion are the two major challenges to the ultrasound evaluation of composite structures; these two factors complicate the control of phased array ultrasound propagation both theoretically and experimentally. This is especially true for thick high attenuation carbon fiber or glass fiber composite materials that have been widely applied in aerospace and wind turbine industries.In our study, ultrasound phased array technique was applied to increase the acoustic penetration power in high acoustic attenuation composite materials. First, ultrasound phased array signal in isotropic materials was studied to calibrate the probe parameters. Then for composite materials, the dependence of ultrasound field on the number of active elements, steering angles, beam focusing laws and on the characteristics of materials was analyzed and optimized through theoretical simulations and experimental evaluations. Results showed that the steering angles and the parameters of beam focusing laws might change the ultrasound beam intensity and uniformity, which had a significant influence on the sensitivity and resolution of the technique; the anisotropic properties of composite materials could distort the ultrasound beam, which made the calibration a necessary and important procedure during practical inspections. The influence of ultrasound frequency and beam angle were also quantitatively evaluated. The proposed research has the potential to apply ultrasound phased array technique to the detection of defects in composite materials and the evaluation of composite structural health. The study of the interaction between ultrasound and composite structures will open the window for the successful application of ultrasound phased array technique.",,,,,ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE2015)ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE2015),"NOV 13-19, 2015NOV 13-19, 2015",ASMEASME,"Houston, TXHouston, TX",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5756-4,,,,,,,,,"S Dakota State Univ, Brookings, SD 57007 USA",,,,2016-06-29,WOS:000377420100005,,

A passive tracer was introduced in the model to delineate the growth and decay of the plume and to diagnose the spread of the CR discharge in the shelf, into Prince William Sound (PWS) and offshore. Furthermore, a model experiment with doubled discharge was conducted to investigate potential impacts of accelerated glacier melt in future climate scenarios. The 2010 and 2011 simulation revealed that the upstream (eastward) transport in the NGoA is negligible. About 60 % of the passive tracer released in the CR discharge is transported southwestward on the shelf, while another one third goes into PWS with close to 60 % of which exiting PWS to the shelf from Montague Strait. The rest few percent is transported across the shelf break and exported to the GoA basin. The downstream transport and the transport into PWS are strongly regulated by the downwelling-favorable wind, while the offshore transport is related to the accumulation of plume water in the shelf, frontal instability, and the Alaskan Stream. It takes weeks in spring for the buoyancy to accumulate so that a bulge forms outside of the CR estuary. The absence of strong storms as in the summer of 2010 allows the bulge continue growing to trigger frontal instability. These frontal features can interact with the Alaskan Stream to induce transport pulses across the shelf break. Alternatively as in 2011, a downwelling-favorable wind event in early August (near the peak discharge) accelerates the southwestward coastal current and produces an intense downstream transport event. Both processes result in fast drains of the buoyancy and the plume content, thereby rapid disintegration of the plume in the shelf. The plume in the doubled discharge case can be two to three times in size, which affects not only the magnitude but also the timing of certain transport events. In particular, the offshore transport increases by several folds because the plume appears to be more easily entrained by the seaward flow along the side of Hinchinbrook Canyon.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,0,14,,,1616-7341,1616-7228,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME USAUniv Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA USARemote Sensing Solut, Pasadena, CA USA",Remote Sensing Solut,,,2014-03-19,WOS:000331200500005,,

In this area of research, the Tidal Stream Generator (TSG) power plant is one of the most recent forms of renewable energy to be developed. The main feature of this energy converter is related to the input resource which is the tidal current speed. Since its behaviour is variable and with disturbances, these systems must be able to maintain performance despite the input variations. This article deals with the design and control of a tidal stream converter system. The Fuzzy Gain Scheduling (FGS) technique is used to control the blade pitch angle of the turbine, in order to protect the plant in the case of a strong tidal range. Rotational speed control is investigated by means of the back-to-back power converters.

In addition to the most pronounced biodiversity loss at the Frasnian-Famennian (F-F) boundary and the end Famennian, there were also less extensively studied extinction pulses in the Middle to Late Givetian and the Frasnian. Here we used a combination of palynological, elemental, molecular and stable isotope analyses to investigate a sedimentary record of reef-systems from this time period in the Canning Basin, Western Australia.The acquired data generally showed distinct variations between sediments from (i) the time around the Givetian-Frasnian (G-F) boundary and (ii) later in the Frasnian and indicated a distinct interval of biotic stress, particularly for reef-builders, in the older sediments. Alterations of pristane/phytane ratios, gammacerane indices, Chlorobi biomarkers, delta D-kerogen and chroman ratios describe the change from a restricted marine palaeoenvironment with an anoxic/euxinic hypolimnion towards a presumably open marine setting with a vertically mixed oxic to suboxic water column. Simultaneous excursions in delta C-13 profiles of carbonates, organic matter (OM) and hydrocarbons in the older sediments reflect the stratification-induced enhancement of OM-recycling by sulfate reducing bacteria. Alterations in sterane distributions and elevated abundances of methyltrimethyltridecylchromans (MTTCs) and perylene indicate an increased terrigenous nutrient input via riverine influx, which would have promoted stratification, phytoplankton blooms and the development of lower water column anoxia.The detected palaeoenvironmental conditions around the G-F boundary may reflect a local or global extinction event Our data furthermore suggest a contribution of the higher plant-expansion and photic zone euxinia to the Late Devonian extinctions, consistent with previous hypotheses. Furthermore, this work might contribute to the understanding of variations in Devonian reef margin and platform-top architecture, relevant for petroleum exploration and development in the global Devonian hydrocarbon resources.

J,,,,,,,,,Onno Bokhove,,FastFEM: Behaviour of fast ships in waves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 29 2014,2014,"The use of fast (10 to 60m) ships has become popular in maritime operations. They nowadays emerge in search and rescue operations, surveillance, Coast Guard activities, interceptor and security missions, anti drugs and piracy actions, in fast supply to offshore platforms, and for crew transport and wind farm maintenance. The main advantage is their speed, while the challenge is to maintain safe seakeeping at high speeds in mild to heavy seaway, while also keeping these ships affordable, reliable, fuel efficient and comfortable. We propose to develop new simulation tools for the dynamics of fast ships and surrounding waves in breaking seas, and to validate these simulations with advanced and novel towing tank laboratory experiments.Classical calculations of waves are based on (non)linear potential flow wave theory. Such simulations are quite good provided accurate numerical methods are used, but can never deal with wave breaking due to the potential flow Ansatz. In addition, potential flow wave codes in three dimensions need to become computationally more efficient. This requires further scientific development (work package WP1 at the University of Twente, The Netherlands by Jaap van der Vegt with Onno Bokhove), especially when wave and ship dynamics are fully and nonlinearly coupled, as proposed. Another key issue in WP1 is preservation of the variational formulation of wave dynamics, to ensure numerical stability, within our partially existing discontinuous Galerkin finite element methodology (DGFEM). Our first innovation is to simulate wave breaking around the ships, as well as incoming breaking waves, with a new, advanced single-phase mixture theory for the water-air mixture (in WP2 at the University of Leeds). In contrast to other numerical methods that can deal with wave breaking (such as Volume of Fluid methods and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics), our method does not lead to (unwanted) numerical wave damping in areas with smooth waves. Our second innovation is that the new method is by design constructed to include our (variational) potential flow limit with nonlinear ship dynamics. Hence, this new methodology for fast ships in breaking seas does require that the DGFEM for the combined ship and potential flow wave dynamics is fully developed as well (in WP1). Essential is the anticipated validation of both (integrated) simulation tools against advanced and new towing tank experiments. Beyond the numerical validation, these towing tank experiments (in WP3 at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands by Rene Huijsmans) provide direct and new data to the users in the form of the measured (nonlinear and breaking) wave environment around fast ships, pressures on their hulls as well as onboard accelerations. These laboratory measurements will be directly used by our users: Damen Shipyards, MARIN, Royal Netherlands Navy, Royal Netherlands Rescue Organisation (KNRM), Bureau Veritas, and Lloyds Register, while the proposed simulation tools supporting new hull designs will form a sustained investment.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/L025388/1,,,,,,,,University of Leeds,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15352453,,

The melting temperature of ice I decreases to -22 degreesC when pressure increases to 207.5 MPa. It is possible to freeze a biological or food sample under pressure (obtaining ice I, III, V, VI, or VII), to enhance ice nucleation by fast pressure release, to keep a sample at subzero temperatures without ice crystal formation, to generate pressure through freezing, to reach the glassy state of water by fast cooling under pressure, or to thaw a frozen sample under pressure below 0 degreesC. Fast pressure release from -10 or -20% and 100 or 200 MPa (with a prior cooling step under pressure), called pressure-shift freezing, induces significant supercooling (as detected by fast data acquisition) and enhances uniform ice nucleation throughout the sample. When freezing is then completed at atmospheric pressure, different microscopy techniques reveal numerous small ice crystals with no specific orientation or marked size gradient. Crystals are smaller in pressure-shift frozen gels than in similarly frozen oil-in-water emulsions. In the latter, increasing solute concentrations in the aqueous phase tends to reduce ice crystal size. Modeling is proposed for pressure-shift freezing, although the supercooling and nucleation steps are not taken into account. Both freezing under various pressure levels and pressure-shift freezing are reported for gels (mainly heat-induced protein gels), emulsions, and plant and animal tissues. In spite of some discrepancies, gel or tissue structure and texture are generally better maintained after thawing, as compared to control samples frozen by air blast or immersion in a cooling medium at 0.1 MPa. Less liquid exudation is also observed. However, some protein denaturation is detected (unfolding of myofibrillar proteins, toughening of meat or seafood), especially when the initial cooling step is carried out at a high pressure level for a long time. Pressure application at subzero temperature is found to inactivate only some enzymes, but causes a significant degree of microbial inactivation for several species of micro-organisms, Freezing gels or vegetables under pressure with the formation of ice III, V, or VI appears to maintain tissue structure and texture, but the mechanisms for these effects are not fully understood. Pressure-assisted thawing markedly enhances the rate of thawing, mainly due to a greater DeltaT between the subzero thawing temperature and that of the heating medium. Specific packaging and equipment requirements for pressure-assisted freezing and thawing are discussed. Suggestions are made for further Studies on high pressure-subzero temperature treatments, such as the influence of sample size and composition; the effects on cell membranes; the reduced need for blanching before freezing; the viability of pressure-shift frozen cells, embryos, or organs; the mechanisms of protein denaturation; and texture-promoting effects, especially in ice creams.",,,,,,,,,84,0,0,0,23,0,89,,,8755-9129,1525-6103,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sci & Tech, Lab Genie Biol & Sci Aliments, Unite Biochim & Technol Alimentaires, F-34095 Montpellier, France",Univ Sci & Tech,,,2000-01-01,WOS:000166049900003,,

Findings indicated strong support for the project, arising from beliefs that the project enhanced local distinctiveness by 'putting the area on the map worldwide': appeared visually familiar and helped tackle climate change. These positive beliefs outweighed concerns about outcome and process aspects, which were preponderant in one of the two villages. The project was interpreted to have few positive local economic outcomes, to potentially threaten local livelihoods and local ecology.

J,,,,,,,,,"Huettel, Markus","Kostka, Joel",RAPID:Rates and mechanisms controlling the microbial degradation of crude oil from the MC252 spill in Gulf of Mexico beach sands,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 15 2010,2010,"With funding through this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID), scientists at the Florida State University will study the transport and biodegradation of Deepwater Horizon crude oil in Gulf beach sands. The study will place emphasis on the sediment clogging caused by oil filtration and ensuing changes to the structure and function of indigenous microbial communities. Although the process of oil contamination of beaches has been investigated in great detail, little is known about the effect of crude oil on beach filtration and the effect of oil-related reduction of beach pore water flows on oil transport and microbial degradation within the sandy sediment. This filtration process, caused by wave set up and tidal water level changes, constitutes an effective pumping mechanism that can drive low-viscosity crude oil and detergent-oil mixtures deep into beach sediments. Oil transport into deeper, anoxic layers may decrease oil degradation rates, thereby extending the period of toxin release to nearshore waters. Goals of the project are to assess 1) how much and how deep oil is filtered into the beach, 2) how oil alters the beach filtration rate and thereby sediment oxygenation, 4) how oil contamination changes structure and function of the sand microbial community and 5) which factors regulate oil degradation by microbial communities in marine sands. To quantify these processes, sets of sediment cores will be taken at time intervals along a short transect from the supralittoral to the sublittoral zone at a sandy beach in the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico. The sediment will be analyzed for oil content (amount, composition and distribution), sediment characteristics (permeability, porosity, grain size spectrum, oxygen penetration), and the microbial community (composition and activity). Oil will be characterized using a GC-MS. Changes in microbial community composition and activity will be assessed using a combination of culture-based and cultivation-independent molecular techniques. The results will quantify the uptake of oil and detergent-oil mixtures into Gulf sand beaches, the effect of these substances on sediment physical and biogeochemical properties, the response of the sedimentary microbial community, and oil degradation rates. Broader Impacts: The sandy beaches of the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico are of high ecological and economical value as they are biotope, foraging and breeding area of a large number species, and present a main tourist attraction. Tourism is Florida?s largest sector of the state economy with about 60 million visitors every year and a $57 billion impact. The pollution of the beaches by crude oil thus presents a major threat to Florida?s economy. Previous research indicates that oil can penetrate deep into sandy beaches, which may change microbial community activities and decrease the oil degradation rates. Consequences include toxin release from such beaches extending over many years. Understanding the uptake, transport and degradation of oil in sandy Gulf beaches is prerequisite for designing clean up and remediation procedures. Research of this project focuses on pristine Gulf beaches for which no data on oil penetration and degradation exist and that now are threatened by the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The project combines research with education and training of two graduate students. Project results will be published in scientific journals, local outlets and the internet. The data collected in this rapid response project will provide data for a proposal of a three year project focusing on transport and degradation of crude oil components in permeable shore sediments. The project goal is to generate quantitative data that permit forecasting of the oil degradation process and optimization of bioremediation procedures.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1044939,,,,,,,,Florida State University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13800945,,

The determination of the abundance of volatiles in extrasolar planets is very important as it can provide constraints on transport in protoplanetary disks and on the formation location of planets. However, constraining the internal structure of low-mass planets from transit measurements is known to be a degenerate problem.Aims. Using planetary structure and evolution models, we show how observations of transiting planets can be used to constrain their internal composition, in particular the amount of volatiles in the planetary interior, and consequently the amount of gas (defined in this paper to be only H and He) that the planet harbors. We first explore planets that are located close enough to their star to have lost their gas envelope. We then concentrate on planets at larger distances and show that the observation of transiting planets at different evolutionary ages can provide statistical information on their internal composition, in particular on their volatile fraction.Methods. We computed the evolution of low-mass planets (super-Earths to Neptune-like) for different fractions of volatiles and gas. We used a four-layer model (core, silicate mantle, icy mantle, and gas envelope) and computed the internal structure of planets for different luminosities. With this internal structure model, we computed the internal and gravitational energy of planets, which was then used to derive the time evolution of the planet. Since the total energy of a planet depends on its heat capacity and density distribution and therefore on its composition, planets with different ice fractions have different evolution tracks.Results. We show for low-mass gas-poor planets that are located close to their central star that assuming evaporation has efficiently removed the entire gas envelope, it is possible to constrain the volatile fraction of close-in transiting planets. We illustrate this method on the example of 55 Cnc e and show that under the assumption of the absence of gas, the measured mass and radius imply at least 20% of volatiles in the interior. For planets at larger distances, we show that the observation of transiting planets at different evolutionary ages can be used to set statistical constraints on the volatile content of planets.Conclusions. These results can be used in the context of future missions like PLATO to better understand the internal composition of planets, and based on this, their formation process and potential habitability.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,0004-6361,1432-0746,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, SwitzerlandUniv Bern, Ctr Space & Habitabil, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",,,,2016-08-03,WOS:000379141300088,,

Such wind parks are connected to the electrical grid on the land by comprehensive underground cables. The underground cables are a potential for a fault occurrence.The next area of concern would be in the multiple mechanically switched capacitor banks or FACTS used for dynamic reactive compensation. The voltage flicker produced by large wind parks owing to the varying speed of the wind mills on the interconnected grid has a deteriorating effect on the other connected equipment and also on the grid as well. To maintain voltage stability as per NERC guidelines and to mitigate voltage flickers, dynamic reactive compensation can be provided with multiple mechanically switched capacitor banks or FACTS.Therefore the paper will discuss in detail the protection possibilities for the underground cables and the reactors for large wind parks located offshore.",,,,,62nd Annual Conference for Protective Relay Engineers62nd Annual Conference for Protective Relay Engineers,"MAR 30-APR 02, 2009MAR 30-APR 02, 2009",,"Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TXTexas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,2474-9753,,978-1-4244-4182-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000271534700037,,

This code uses the p-FFT method, which enables to handle dozens of elastic modes with about 100,000 hydrodynamic panels in a practical CPU time. In addition, in order to simplify the input and output of the structural data and elastic modes computation, the combination of MSC NASTRAN and MSC PATRAN, which are popular commercial codes, is used. The interface between these commercial codes and the hydrodynamic code also has been developed. From the theoretical aspect, the code features that the consistency between the structural discretization and the hydrodynamic discretization is maintained so that the energy conservation between the wave making damping and the modal damping is satisfied.2.Validation of the computer codeA detailed convergence test of the code has been carried out and it is find that the code has enough convergence to carry out the computation of full scale structure. The effect of viscous damping has been investigated with the experimental data of the viscous damping. Comparisons between the numerical results and experimental data by NIES have been carried out, and it is confirmed that the numerical results have enough accuracy.3.Establishment of the analysis of the very large mobile offshore structureSummarizing overall results a concept of VLMOS has been presented.

Computational fluid dynamics approaches were used to simulate unsteady flow fields. The Transition SST turbulence model was used to compute the turbulent characteristics, and second-order temporal/spatial schemes were used to reduce dissipation effects. To investigate the behavior of vortices individually, each main vortex core was targeted manually and its strength is computed. It is shown that despite the existence of coherent structures, the interaction of organized vortices is responsible for the complexity of the flow beyond the hydrofoil in post-stall. The primary LEV and primary TEV have the longest lifetime among the LEVs and TEVs, respectively. The Primary LEV loses strength quickly due to counteraction with the TEV and disruption of the energy source provided by the leading edge shear. The secondary LEV plays an important role when dynamic stall occurs and provides a lift peak in post-stall. There are time delays between the maximum circulation of main vortices and corresponding peak of the lift coefficient loop. The general interaction of counter-rotating vortices is responsible for these delays between peaks of the lift coefficient and maximum circulations.",,,,,,,,,48,8,0,0,0,1,54,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Pusan Natl Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Pusan 609735, South Korea",,,,2016-12-07,WOS:000388050400018,,

These vehicles are commonly used by several industries such as offshore oil companies, offshore wind energy companies and environmental organizations. These underwater vehicles may be classified as Free-Swimming Systems, FSS, or Tether Management Systems, TMS. Tether Management Systems use the cable to transmit data and steering commands, and as a mean for power supply. It is known that the cable has a strong influence on the dynamics and maneuverability of a ROV. To improve the motion accuracy and stability of the control of a ROV, it is necessary to understand the nature and to estimate the value of the mutual reaction forces between the ROV and the cable.This research seeks the modeling of the overall underwater tethered vehicle, by iteratively coupling the results from the finite element analysis, FEA, of the cable with the dynamic model of the ROV, as obtained by using the standard NewtonEuler formulation. Morison equation is employed to obtain the cable transient response. In this work, the ROV tether is defined as a flexible, slender cylinder, with circular cross section and made of a material with nonlinear elastic behavior. The cable is assumed to be in a specific extended initial configuration, with one of its ends fixed in ground. The FEA analysis of the cable is performed with the help of the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics. A commercial small ROV is selected as the case study to apply the Newton-Euler method, considering the location of its actuators and other actual parameters such as mass, matrix of mass moments of inertia and drag coefficients. To include the cable forces into the dynamic model of the ROV, it is necessary to perform an iterative process between the cable analysis results and the ROV open loop response. The modeling approach starts with an FSS system initial velocity, which is fed into the cable FEA analysis. Both analyses are iterated, following a mutual feedback scheme, until results converge, obtaining the complete tethered vehicle model.

The platform is an extraordinary and oldest productive petroleum system on the earth where oils were generated in Precambrian and kept intact since. The platform established on a stable craton consolidated through Archean to the end of Early Proterozoic, and flat-lying, largely undeformed strata of geologic ages covering from Riphean to Neogene were deposited. The source rock is hypothesized to be Riphean organic-rich shales that were deposited in passive type platform margin. Presently, these shales are strongly deformed, variably metamorphosed, and exposed in orogenic belts such as the Baikal-Patom and Yenisey complexes. The major reservoirs are Lower Vendian continental and/or shallow marine sandstones. Porosity of productive intervals ranges from 10 to 15%. Permeability varies widely from near zero to hundreds of millidarcies, and is strongly related to fracturing and diagenetic changes. The preservation of oil and gas for such an extremely long period is attributed to the presence of thick Lower Cambrian salt beds that act as excellent seals. Both structure and stratigraphy played important roles in hydrocarbon generation, migration and trapping. Major hydrocarbon accumulations occurred in structural traps except for the Kovykta field. The traps are anticlinal drapes over basement highs. The Lena-Viluy oil and gas province has the different petroleum system. The source rock is the Permian coal beds, and the Upper Paleozoic to Jurassic clastic rocks consist of reservoir and seal. The Permian coals generate gases owing to the type of organic matter (Type III) and deep burial. According to the maturity data, the Permian sequence entered the oil window in Triassic, and the gas window in Jurassic. The Upper Paleozoic to Jurassic clastics were deposited in variable environments from continental to paralic that include fluvial, lacustrine, paludal, and deltaic environments.",,,,"동 시베리아 대지는 추정 자원량이 석유 80~100억톤, 가스 26조~30조 m3에 달하는 거대한 자원의 보고이다. 대지는 석유가스가 선캄브리아 층에서 생성되고 부존하여 지구상에서 가장 오래된, 그리고 매우 이례적인 석유시스템을 형성하고 있다. 대지는 구조운동과 변성작용의 영향을 거의 받지 않은 광대한 조구조 단위로, 시원대~원생대 전기까지 안정된 대륙지괴를 형성하고, 원생대 후기 리페안에서 신 제3기의 지질시대를 망라하는 층서가 평탄하게 퇴적되었다. 근원암은 대지 주변부에서 퇴적되고 유기물을 풍부하게 함유한 리페안층이 가상적으로 설정되어 있는데 바이칼-파톰, 예니세이 등 구조대에서 흔적을 찾을 수 있다. 주요 저류암은 벤디안 하부의 육상 또는 천해성 사암으로 속성작용과 단열의 영향으로 10~15% 공극률, 수백 mD의 투과도를 보이며, 층준의 두께는 수~수십 m이다. 대지의 석유가스가 오랜 기간 보존될 수 있었던 것은 캄브리아 전기에 석호형 대륙해 환경에서 광범위하게 순환 퇴적되었던 탄산염암과 증발암에 포함된 암염의 뛰어난 덮개 효과에 기인한다. 트랩은 층서 및 구조가 석유가스의 생성, 이동 및 집적에 모두 중요하게 작용하였으나 코빅타를 제외한 대부분의 유전에서 융기된 기반암에 형성된 배사구조 등이 보다 우세하다. 레나-빌루이 지대는 레나-퉁구스카 지대와 다른 석유시스템을 구성하는데 근원암은 페름기 석탄층이고, 저류암과 덮개암은 고생대 상부~쥐라기 쇄설암이다. 페름기 석탄층은 유기물 특성상 주로 가스가 생성했는데 트라이아스기에 석유 생성단계, 쥐라기에 가스 생성단계에 도달하였다. 고생대 상부~쥐라기 쇄설암은 육성 또는 반해성의 하상, 호상, 삼각주상, 소택지상의 다양한 환경에서 퇴적된 사암, 이암, 셰일 등이 교호하여 저류암-덮개암을 형성한다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2288-0291,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-01-01,KJD:ART001399551,,

Seven pages are given to the rhaphe as the accepted means by which the diatoms perform their as yet dimly understood act of locomotion. Considerable new light is thrown on the minute openings in the silica envelope by which the living plant holds contact with its environment. Under Internal Structure, the cytoplasm, nucleus, pyre-noids, oil content, chromatophores, have each separate chapters, with a full discussion of the wide differences of the last named bodies and their reputed worth for systematic classification. Here, as throughout the book, each subject is followed with a bibliography and the descriptions are aided by new illustrations[long dash]114 in all. Under Diatom Biology, the solitary, attached and colony-forming species are separately described. This is followed by a chapter on reproduction, including cell division, wall formation, production of auxospores for restoring the ancestral size of the species, and resting-spores for hibernation. Another chapter is given to the dimly understood microspores of certain genera. Dimorphism and polymorphism are also discussed. Ten pages are devoted to the 100-year-old puzzle of diatom locomotion. Monstrosities, parasitism and symbiosis are discussed. Under Organography or diatom functions the matter is divided into turgor, nutri-. tion, excretion, response to light and temperature, and service to other organisms. The functions of the separate elements of the diatom cell,[long dash]its cytoplasm, chromatophores, pyrenoids, oil drops, nucleus, centrosome, together with the external gelatinous envelope, pedicels of attachment and the secreted matrix of colonies[long dash]are explained. Brief directions are offered for collecting, growing, cleaning and mounting diatoms, with receipts for the most approved mounting media.

Learning from Nature or biomimicry can be a powerful tool in designing, developing and accessing the next generation of synthetic materials and systems. Furthermore, biomimetic concepts will account for an estimated $1.2 trillion in global economic development, and have already contributed to familiar products like Velcro and wind turbines. Thus, there is a critical need for the US to educate the next generation of internationally-minded biomimicry thinkers to develop a new wave of innovative materials. As such, this PIRE brings together an interdisciplinary team of US and Swiss collaborators to carry out research and education in the area of Bio-Inspired Materials & Systems. Specifically, the PIRE will utilize inspiration from Nature to design new materials that can change toughness in response to their environment, are safer and more effective biological implants, will transmit nerve-like electrical signals, and can respond to the environment to initiate biological processes, all for use in soft robotic applications. A range of innovative educational and outreach activities will train US students in learning from Nature and in a bio-inspired philosophy. This training will happen in an international context with Swiss collaborators, world leaders in biomimetic concepts and research. Students will gain exposure to themes cutting across chemistry, polymers, physics, biology, and engineering in the development of multi-functional, active materials. Mentoring, diversity, cultural competency, globalization, and effective scientific communication are emphasized as critical elements of the PIRE. Nature has a multitude of examples of complex materials and systems that go well beyond the current capabilities of synthetic systems. The innovation potential in this domain is vast and a large-scale interdisciplinary effort is required to realize paradigm-changing scientific breakthroughs. To that end, an international partnership between biomimicry experts at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), the University of Chicago (UoC), and the University of Fribourg/Adolphe Merkle Institute in Switzerland in Bio-inspired Materials and Systems is established. Building upon collaborative strengths in polymer synthesis, computational modeling, mechanical characterization, robotics, imaging, manufacturing, biology, biomedical engineering, physics, and molecular engineering, five Bio-inspired Materials and Systems projects are envisioned: (1) Silk-inspired Nanocomposites: Spider/Caddisfly Silk Mimics; (2) Sea Cucumber, Squid Beak and Pine Cone Inspired Adaptive Composites; (3) Excitable Polyelectrolyte Fiber Networks/Gels: Toward Artificial Neurons; (4) Dynamic and Functional Fibers Inspired by the Extracellular Matrix; and (5) Soft Robotics Inspired by Worm Locomotion. These research thrusts are directed toward the development of functional, programmable, and responsive materials for deployment in soft robotic systems. Faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students will spend time in Switzerland engaging in synergistic research/educational activities. An educational and innovation partnership with local thought leaders in biomimicry will guide the training of the next-generation of global scientists and engineers in this interdisciplinary endeavor. Effective science communication will be highlighted via existing programming with the Museum of Science and Industry (MSI) of Chicago. Community outreach activities include research opportunities at CWRU and UoC for underrepresented high school students in STEM as part of an expanded Biomimetic Envoys program and the development of biomimetic hands-on demonstrations for annual participation in the Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) Discovery Day at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1844463,,,,,,,,University of Delaware,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14030338,,

The formation consists of a shallow-water carbonates that include limestones, dolomitic limestones with subordinate anhydrite and dolomites. It reaches a thickness of as much as 625-970 m (2,050-3,182 ft) in the subsurface and 125-960 m (410-3,149 ft) in outcrops. The Khuff Formation is interpreted as a second-order composite sequence represented by the KS1 through KS7 third-order sequences. The Khuff transgressive systems set starts with the KS7 event and ends at the maximum flooding surface of KS4. The highstand systems set starts in the upper portion of the Khuff with a second-order maximum flooding surface (MFS-4) and ends with a sequence boundary at the top of KS1 that characterizes the top of the Khuff Formation. The formation is subdivided into ten facies units distinguished on the basis of their depositional textures that represent an overall regressive carbonate-evaporite sequence. Based oil the paleoecology, sedimentary structures and lithology, four distinct depositional settings can be recognized: (1) supratidal (sabkha), (2) lagoon, (3) shoal and (4) shallow shelf. The formation can be broadly subdivided into two major carbonate units deposited in two different hydraulic regimes, which are separated by an anhydrite bed (the Middle Anhydrite marker).A detailed petrographic study of the Khuff carbonates reveals a complicated diagenetic history. Four diagenetic settings have been identified: (1) marine phreatic, (2) mixed phreatic, (3) meteoric phreatic, and (4) burial. The Khuff Formation has both primary and secondary porosity. Most open pores are a result of interparticle, intercrystalline, dissolution vug or enlarged mouldic porosity The diagenetic features in these sediments are mainly partial cementation, dolomitization and the development of secondary anhydrite. Porosity ranges from 6-20% and permeability from less than 1.0 to more than 500 md. Horizontal permeability is greatly enhanced by subvertical partings of the open pores, common in microcrystalline dolomites. Stylolites are common, but unimportant as vertical barriers. Extensive fracturing of the reservoir has produced a dense network of intersecting vertical and subvertical fractures. These fractures have a significant impact on the enhancement of the effective porosity and permeability.The Khuff Formation has large volumes of proven gas reserves in Bahrain, Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and minor oil in Oman. While the Khuff Formation forms prolific gas and condensate reservoirs in the offshore United Arab Emirates, no hydrocarbons have been found in the onshore area. Locally here the reservoir is capped by the shales and dolomites of the overlying Sudair Formation (Early Triassic).

Most of the fields have more than one pay zone and produce from shallow-water carbonates and clastics that range in age from Infracambrian to Oligo-Miocene. A providential juxtaposition of source-reservoir-seal, migration history and trapping mechanism has lead to the entrapment of hydrocarbons throughout the Phanerozoic strata of the Middle East. Each occurrence shares some characteristics but each also has unique features. The geographic occurrence of hydrocarbons in the region reflects the original facies variations across the depositional shelf and basin and the tectonic history of basement faults and halokinetic activity. The evaluation and integration of these critical variables, together with an appreciation of the maturation, migration history and trapping mechanisms, drives the search for new fields. The continued discovery of new fields proves that the region has not yielded all its treasure and stimulates future exploration. Although evidence for orogenic deformation is lacking in the Middle East, epeirogenic warping is common. The latter is attributed to the reactivation of basement faults, and evaporite structures and flow at depth. A prominent sedimentary and erosional break, locally marked by eroded Hercynian unconformities, followed an important Late Palaeozoic epeirogenic uplift. Similarly, Mesozoic sedimentary fill is broken by a major change in tectonic and depositional regimes, and numerous unconformities thought to be primarily controlled by high-frequency fluctuations in eustatic sea level and a low uniform rate of tectonic movement. Late Cretaceous and Tertiary events followed the collision and partial subduction of the east and southeastern margin of the Arabian Plate and involved vertical epeirogenic uplift of the resulting folded and thrusted gravity features. Vast areas of the Middle East Basin have yet to be extensively drilled. Although the long-lived stability of the shelf has influenced the development of the giant oil pools, and to some extent reduced the potential for stratigraphic traps, it has not eliminated the potential for smaller structures and the exploration for new oil and gas reserves. Future exploration is expected to focus on the discovery of smaller structures and subtle traps revealed by analysis of existing geological data and special seismic processing. Exploration will involve extensive regional and local geological-sedimentological studies, 3D or 4D seismic surveys and drilling progrmmes, and proposed better petroleum system model(s) for each basin (or sub-basin).",,,,,,,,,45,1,0,0,2,0,45,,,0305-8719,,978-1-86239-378-3,,,,,,,,,"Middle East Geol & Environm Estab, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",Middle East Geol & Environm Estab,,,2014-08-20,WOS:000337180000019,,

Most importantly, it is necessary to disperse the oil over a wide range of the ocean water column and prevent the oil from reaching the shore where it can accumulate and create long term ecological hazards. The proposed research addresses the issues relating to creating oil droplets which can be effectively dispersed in the ocean water column. Requirements for dispersant efficacy include the following (1) The dispersant must be applied at the target oil at sufficient dosage to form droplets (2) It is important that the dispersant be applied early before the lighter components of the oil evaporate (3) The dispersant must be able to lower the oil-water interfacial tension sufficiently so that small oil droplets can be created which can be dispersed over the water column (4) It is preferable that the oil droplets remain dispersed long enough to be biodegraded by marine organisms. Alternatively, if the droplets are widely dispersed, it may be preferable to find a method to sediment the oil to the ocean floor where they can be biodegraded. The PIs propose to conduct research that will address the following aspects of dispersant design and efficacy evaluation (1) studies on the compositional variations of dispersants and their effects on droplet microstructure and stability (2) effects of compositional variations of oil characteristics to understand if droplet solidification can occur at the low temperatures and enhanced pressures relevant to deepwater injection of dispersants (3) introduction of methane into the system at high pressures and low temperatures to define the existence of gas hydrates in emulsion droplets (4) the implementation of highly biodegradable surfactants and biosurfactants to reduce toxicity potential significantly (5) the implementation of particle stabilized emulsions to gradually sediment the hydrocarbons and subject them to biodegradation. The impact of this research would be broad, as several large constituencies are being affected by this deepwater oil spill. They include livelihoods for the fishermen in the Gulf area, the ecological impact on the wetlands which may cause unsustainable inland erosion around the Louisiana coastline and a threat to wildlife that may undermine the prevailing ecosystem. And, indeed the future of oil drilling at these extreme undersea environments may be at stake. The PIs plan to disseminate the results of our research through on line postings as quickly as we can confirm their scientific validity, so that the broader scientific community can take advantage of them rapidly. Over the longer term (but clearly of less consequence at this moment of crisis), this research, which has a strong scientific underpinning but is focused on rapidly solving a critical national problem represents an ideal learning experience for graduate students. They plan to present the results of this work, as well as the broader problem and potential solutions to the local community through evening lectures, to students in our colloidal phenomena classes, and to high school students and teachers so that they are well-educated on the different aspects of oil spills. Both Tulane and URI have strong, streamlined programs at the universities for pursuing these avenues.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1043163,,,,,,,,Tulane University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13800922,,
J,,,,,,,,,,,PIRE: Bio-Inspired Materials and Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 01 2017,2017,"LaShanda Korley, Jonathan Pokorski, Gary Wnek (Case Western Reserve University), Stuart Rowan (University of Chicago) Materials that are found in Nature display a wide range of properties including responsiveness to the environment, signal transmission, and the ability to adapt to support life. Learning from Nature or biomimicry can be a powerful tool in designing, developing and accessing the next generation of synthetic materials and systems. Furthermore, biomimetic concepts will account for an estimated $1.2 trillion in global economic development, and have already contributed to familiar products like Velcro and wind turbines. Thus, there is a critical need for the US to educate the next generation of internationally-minded biomimicry thinkers to develop a new wave of innovative materials. As such, this PIRE brings together an interdisciplinary team of US and Swiss collaborators to carry out research and education in the area of Bio-Inspired Materials & Systems. Specifically, the PIRE will utilize inspiration from Nature to design new materials that can change toughness in response to their environment, are safer and more effective biological implants, will transmit nerve-like electrical signals, and can respond to the environment to initiate biological processes, all for use in soft robotic applications. A range of innovative educational and outreach activities will train US students in learning from Nature and in a bio-inspired philosophy. This training will happen in an international context with Swiss collaborators, world leaders in biomimetic concepts and research. Students will gain exposure to themes cutting across chemistry, polymers, physics, biology, and engineering in the development of multi-functional, active materials. Mentoring, diversity, cultural competency, globalization, and effective scientific communication are emphasized as critical elements of the PIRE. Nature has a multitude of examples of complex materials and systems that go well beyond the current capabilities of synthetic systems. The innovation potential in this domain is vast and a large-scale interdisciplinary effort is required to realize paradigm-changing scientific breakthroughs. To that end, an international partnership between biomimicry experts at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), the University of Chicago (UoC), and the University of Fribourg/Adolphe Merkle Institute in Switzerland in Bio-inspired Materials and Systems is established. Building upon collaborative strengths in polymer synthesis, computational modeling, mechanical characterization, robotics, imaging, manufacturing, biology, biomedical engineering, physics, and molecular engineering, five Bio-inspired Materials and Systems projects are envisioned: (1) Silk-inspired Nanocomposites: Spider/Caddisfly Silk Mimics; (2) Sea Cucumber, Squid Beak and Pine Cone Inspired Adaptive Composites; (3) Excitable Polyelectrolyte Fiber Networks/Gels: Toward Artificial Neurons; (4) Dynamic and Functional Fibers Inspired by the Extracellular Matrix; and (5) Soft Robotics Inspired by Worm Locomotion. These research thrusts are directed toward the development of functional, programmable, and responsive materials for deployment in soft robotic systems. Faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students will spend time in Switzerland engaging in synergistic research/educational activities. An educational and innovation partnership with local thought leaders in biomimicry will guide the training of the next-generation of global scientists and engineers in this interdisciplinary endeavor. Effective science communication will be highlighted via existing programming with the Museum of Science and Industry (MSI) of Chicago. Community outreach activities include research opportunities at CWRU and UoC for underrepresented high school students in STEM as part of an expanded Biomimetic Envoys program and the development of biomimetic hands-on demonstrations for annual participation in the Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) Discovery Day at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1743475,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13620056,,

DISCO will support research in a range of science and engineering areas including wind energy, ocean circulation, materials by design, additive manufacturing, big data, genomics, and biological function on membrane to organ scales. It provides a framework for creating new data from simulations, analyzing data, and making data available for analysis by remote users. DISCO will also enable the development and sharing of new code and data analysis methods across institutions. This project addresses two of NSF's big ideas: Growing Convergence Research and Harnessing the Data Revolution, as well as the Materials Genome initiative. DISCO will immediately support over 40 faculty research projects involving over 200 scientists. DISCO will be managed in collaboration with Morgan State University, a historically black university, which will be allocated at least 5% of resources to support its educational and computational research programs. Other users nationally will be offered 20% of the resources to be managed through a partnership with XSEDE. Opportunities for training on a diverse set of scientific computing topics will be directly integrated into regular courses across JHU and Morgan State. Courses on computational chemistry, genomics, molecular dynamics, machine learning and protein chemistry are planned. Course materials will be made available through the web and the existing set of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) at JHU will be expanded. These materials will ensure training in the proper use of resources, share best practices between different disciplines and promote interdisciplinary collaboration. The objective of this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project is to create a Data Intensive Scientific Computing (DISCO) environment that integrates high performance computing with tools for generating, analyzing and disseminating data sets of ever increasing size. The cluster will contain over 5 petabytes of storage and heterogeneous compute nodes optimized for different research projects and complex, optimized work flows: standard dual processor nodes, large memory nodes, and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) enhanced nodes. An instance of SciServer software will enhance analysis and provide a platform for disseminating data through a web portal. This robust capability will become a powerful resource for developing and sharing code and infrastructure tools used by interdisciplinary data scientists at Johns Hopkins University, Morgan State University and beyond. DISCO will enable computational fluid dynamics studies of wind farms, ocean flow and physiological fluid dynamics. Research in multiscale modeling of materials will use machine learning to tailor material properties and integrate physical models at different scales to improve performance of additive manufacturing and connect defects and microstructures to macroscopic performance of crystals, polymers and other soft materials. DISCO will also enable sequencing of new genomes, study of variance within species and research on the microbiome. On larger scales, research on the dynamics of biological systems will examine function of proteins, membranes, cells and organs, including the impact of nanoparticles on function. This new integrated environment will reshape computational research practices and will be conducive to radical transformative research.

The turbine blades are designed to achieve the optimal angle of attack based on maximizing lift-to-drag ratio, and then the distribution of chord lengths and pitch angles is determined. In this way, a highly efficient but a lightly loaded tidal turbine model design utilizing the S814 profile, is achieved. Oscillatory motions of flows with single frequency over a range of current numbers and reduced frequencies have been considered. The investigation shows that the unsteadiness of the hydrodynamics on the blades is governed by the dynamic inflow phenomenon. The mean angle of attack along the blade is maintained at or very near the initial optimal value. The effects of the oscillatory frequency and velocity amplitude on the unsteady hydrodynamic loading are explored. A quasi-steady analysis is used to clarify the hydrodynamic response of the model as a lightly loaded rotor. A mathematical model is added to the investigation to analyse the role of the forcing components relative to oscillatory velocity and acceleration on the phase of the unsteady loading.

The small-signal model of a WRIM-based electric drivetrain (WRIM-ED) is established in the electromechanical control timescale. Besides, the external dynamic behaviors of the propulsion load are investigated in detail according to the phase and amplitude of SIVV. The control effects of phase-locked loop (PLL), rotor speed control (RSC), and reactive power control (RPC) are taken into account. In addition, the control schemes by applying the traditional PLL-based vector control (PLL-VC) and an emulated stator voltage-oriented VC (ESVO-VC) for WRIM-ED are described. Moreover, with ESVO-VC, the expression of equivalent inertia for WRIM-ED is much simplified, and there is no need to tune the PLL controller gains.

Interactions between diel and seasonal cycles have been reported to influence fish behaviour but little is known about such interactions in marine top predators. Here, we studied the combined effect of seasonal, tidal and diel cycles on the occurrence of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) within a Marine Protected Area in Scotland. Our analyses were based on echolocation detections from passive acoustic devices (CPODs) deployed at three coastal sites between 2010 and 2016. We described patterns of dolphins occurrence using circular statistics and then used generalised additive mixed models to explore the relative importance of each cycle and any interactions between them. We found site-specific cyclical patterns of presence that remained constant across years. There was a highly significant interaction between seasonal and diel cycles at two sites around deep channels, where occurrence was diurnal in summer but became nocturnal in autumn. The study demonstrates the highly plastic behaviour of bottlenose dolphins and shows a previously unreported behaviour that has management implications for this and other marine protected areas.

During the pile driving process, the pile emits pressure waves directly into the water and the seabed. These waves lead to high underwater noise levels that are potentially harmful to the marine environment. Therefore, several countries have defined limiting values for the noise levels, in order to protect the marine fauna. Noise mitigation systems, such as bubble curtains or mitigation screens, have been developed in order to fulfil these limits. There are several factors influencing the considered noise levels, e.g., the hammer type, the applied hammer energy, the pile geometry, the water depth, the soil type, and the layering of the sediments. All listed factors vary for different piling locations, especially the water depth and sediment characteristics. In order to take all these influences and their interaction into account, numerical models are necessary. An accurate prediction of pile driving noise is often mandatory to check, if noise mitigation systems are needed or to improve the set-up of existing noise reduction measures. Pile driving noise models have been developed by only a few institutions. Most of them are based on a 2D-model for the close vicinity of the pile solved with the finite element method (FEM) and a far-field model for long range predictions. In the current contribution a well validated 2D-FE-model in time domain for the computation of pile driving noise up to distances of 1 km is used. The far-field prediction of noise levels is done by employing the parabolic equations (PE) method, which is also able to take 3D-effects into account. The FE-model for the near-field is split into a pre-calculation, which computes the interaction of hammer and pile, and the main acoustical model. Within the pre-calculation, all parts of the hammer and the pile are discretized in detail and an excitation signal (e.g. force or velocity) at the pile head is derived. This excitation is used as a boundary condition at the pile head within the main acoustical model, which incorporates pile, water column, and soil. Furthermore, in the model it is possible to consider noise mitigation systems. For the far-field PE computation the split-step Pade technique is used. The necessary starting field is derived from the results of the FE-model. Within the PE-model, the characteristic acoustical properties of the seabed are incorporated. The PE-model is able to compute 3D-effects, which occur, e.g., due to a varying water depth caused by canyons, shores, or sand dunes. Within this contribution a validation of the hybrid FEM/PE-model for a case with a flat bathymetry is shown. Moreover, the validated case is used to show possible 3D-effects induced by a varying bathymetry. Finally, the influence of a heavily changing bathymetry of a real-life future pile driving scenario is shown.",,,,,OCEANS - Marseille ConferenceOCEANS - Marseille Conference,"JUN 17-20, 2019JUN 17-20, 2019",,"Marseille, FRANCEMarseille, FRANCE",3,0,0,0,1,0,3,,,0197-7385,,978-1-7281-1450-7,,,,,,,,,"Hamburg Univ Technol TUHH, Inst Modelling & Computat, Hamburg, Germany",,,,2019-01-01,WOS:000591652100252,,

Furthermore, recently developed facilities and sensors around the globe are now allowing access to turbulence structure at significantly higher Reynolds numbers than previously studied. As a result, our understanding of boundary layer dynamics is now progressing at an ever increasing pace. It is timely to review, discuss and advance beyond these developments. The proposal seeks funds to partially cover expenses related to the organization of a workshop on High Reynolds Number Boundary Layer Turbulence: Integrating Descriptions of Statistical Structure, Scaling and Dynamical Evolution, to be held at the campus of the University of New Hampshire, from November 20-22, 2013. The workshop will be targeted specifically to high Reynolds number turbulence. Intellectual Merit Boundary layer dynamics are pervasive in numerous scientific processes and technologically important applications. For these reasons, the capacity to better predict boundary layer behavior, and especially at high Reynolds numbers, persists as a high value objective. The specific aims of this workshop are to (i) provide an interactive setting where the latest findings of this rapidly advancing field can be presented and discussed at length, and (ii) bring together the established and emerging protagonists of boundary layer research (experts in experiments, simulation and analysis) with a cadre of applied mathematicians who are leaders in advancing the systematic development of reduced order models of complex fluid flows. An overarching aim is to more deeply explore how our new and emerging understandings of boundary layer dynamics can be used to benefit the development of more accurate, computationally efficient and more well-founded models of the high Reynolds number boundary layer. Broader Impact Better understanding of turbulent boundary layers at very high Reynolds numbers will lead to improved understanding of a number of engineering and physics problems, such as aerospace applications, meteorology and weather prediction, pollutant dispersion in the atmosphere and in rivers and oceans, energy production with wind farms, etc. This understanding may also allow the design of fluid transportation systems or vessels that require less energy to operate. The proposed workshop will bring together researchers who work on a number of allied problems, but, in many cases, are not yet natural collaborators. The expertise of the attendees is chosen to cover the disciplinary foci that are deemed to span the elements required to develop and refine the systematic construction of the accurate reduced order models for the high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layer; a timely goal that now seems within reach. Given this, the proposed workshop will promote two primary broader impacts. The first is directed toward the formation of a research community whose members have an understanding of the full scope of elements that must rationally be understood if the envisioned modeling paradigm(s) are to be realized. The second is to initiate collaborations amongst the participants, and thus substantively promote the specific areas of inquiry required to advance reduced order model development and implementation. While there will be no formal proceedings of the workshop, the individual presentations will be collected in electronic form, and will subsequently be made available on a public website.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1359025,,,,,,,,University of New Hampshire,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13569267,,

The vertical axis water turbine (VAWT) is an interesting option to harness this energy due to its advantages of facile installation, maintenance and operation. However, it is known that its efficiency is lower than that of other types of turbines due to the unsteady effects present in its flow physics. This work aims to analyse through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) the turbulent flow dynamics around a small scale VAWT confined in a hydrodynamic tunnel. The simulations were developed using the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS), Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) and Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES) turbulence models, all of them based on k-omega Shear Stress Transport (SST). The results and analysis of the simulations are presented, illustrating the influence of the tip speed ratio. The numerical results of the URANS model show a similar behaviour with respect to the experimental power curve of the turbine using a lower number of elements than those used in the DES and DDES models.

AIS and RADAR data resulted in 1.2 and 0.9 transits per hour respectively. We corrected the AIS data to match RADAR effort, and, when effort was equal, AIS data represented only 49.7% of the total large vessel transits observed, and transits per hour were equal for corrected AIS and RADAR data. We recorded more inbound vessels using AIS and more outbound vessels with RADAR. The density pattern of vessels recorded using AIS differed from the RADAR pattern. There was a very discrete pattern for vessels broadcasting an AIS signal that corresponded with the shipping lane buoys. Vessels recorded using RADAR, on the other hand, were more dispersed and displayed a less discrete pattern covering a large area outside of the ship buoys. Winter was the season with the fewest vessel transits for both data collection methods (23.8% AIS; 17.0% RADAR), though there was not a substantial decrease over other seasons in the AIS data. Spring, summer and fall were similar for AIS (24.2%, 25.7%, 26.3% respectively), but fall (31.4%) had considerably more vessels recorded by RADAR than spring and summer (26.5%, 25.1% respectively). When examining vessel type data, more than two thirds of the vessel transits recorded using AIS were cargo vessels (68%; n= 337). Excluding unknown vessels, military vessels made up 47% (n= 179) of the vessels we identified with RADAR, followed by fishing (32%; n= 120) and federal law enforcement (USCG) vessels (10%, n= 38). Spatial analysis was necessary to accurately evaluate ship speed over the entire study area. Spatial analyses of these data allowed us to examine speed behavior in a grid format, reducing the effect of directional bias from an overrepresentation of records from relatively slow moving vessels. Without utilizing spatial analysis, one could draw the conclusion that vessels were transiting the area more slowly than they actually were because AIS speed records are skewed by the greater number of speed points for slower vessels. There was an obvious reduction in speed of vessels transmitting AIS in the shipping lanes from before to after the Ship Strike Rule that was enacted in December 2008 to protect the western North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). The Ship Strike Rule identified a Seasonal Management Area (SMA) within which commercial ships > 65 ft. in length were required to slow to 10kts or less for part of the year (50 CFR224.105). Although vessels slowed, many were not in compliance with the mandatory speed limit of the Rule. Speed restrictions had no effect on vessels observed using RADAR, most of which were not required to comply with the regulations. Cargo ships can be quite large and travel at speeds in excess of 20kt, and were required to broadcast AIS signals, so their behavior was relatively easy to assess. Few cargo vessels traveled 10kt or less for an entire transit through the SMA.Thus, we observed an apparent reaction to the speed restrictions in the SMA, but did not observe strict compliance. Recently the US Coast Guard has begun issuing speeding citations to vessels that have been recorded blatantly disregarding the speed restrictions in SMAs. We applaud these efforts and suspect that if the effort continues consistently it will encourage compliance. Our data suggest that AIS traffic levels were relatively constant (similar to 1.2 transits/ hr) around the clock. For this project, we chose to operate the RADAR unit during daylight hours in order to assess vessel type and approximate length from the shore-based platform. In the future, we need to assess RADAR vessel traffic during all hours in order to better compare it to AIS traffic. In 2007, Virginia ports were listed as the third busiest port on the U. S. Atlantic coast for vessel calls. A large portion of the vessels calls for the port of Baltimore also enter at Chesapeake Bay. The addition of commercial Baltimore traffic as well as federal and fishing vessels not broadcasting AIS very likely makes the Chesapeake Bay approach one of the two busiest coastal port approaches and may make it the busiest in the western North Atlantic. This project raises numerous questions about vessel traffic patterns, vessel speeds, risks to whales and data incorporated into marine spatial planning efforts. There is a definite need for both longer-reaching ship RADAR data and more detailed whale presence data in the mid-Atlantic region, especially off its busiest port. Without data on whale presence, it is nearly impossible to answer questions about the level of risk that the vessel traffic patterns present for whales and on how installations of offshore wind and other energy ventures may affect whales and ships. This project brings into question the use of AIS data alone as an accurate representation of large vessel traffic in coastal regions of the United States, especially in areas with high fishing and military traffic. In Virginia, during daylight hours, AIS data represent a maximum of two thirds, and, as little as one half, of the large vessel (> 65 feet) traffic in the Chesapeake Bay approach. Further research is needed to address the accurate determination of vessel size when using RADAR. A mobile research platform with the capability of assessing RADAR targets on the water or an offshore platform with a greater range and use of night vision technology may provide solutions.",,,,,MTS/IEEE Oceans ConferenceMTS/IEEE Oceans Conference,"OCT 14-19, 2012OCT 14-19, 2012",IEEE; Marine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE OES (IEEE/OES)IEEE; Marine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE OES (IEEE/OES),"Virginia Beach, VAVirginia Beach, VA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-4673-0829-8,,,,,,,,,"Virginia Aquarium & Marine Sci Ctr Fdn, Res & Conservat Sect, Virginia Beach, VA USA",Virginia Aquarium & Marine Sci Ctr Fdn,,,2013-05-05,WOS:000315350300092,,

This paper proposes an innovative approach applied to optimization of horizontal axis hydrokinetic turbines (HAHTs) considering the possibility of cavitation. The minimum pressure coefficient is the criterion used for identifying cavitation on blades. Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory is employed for the rotor design. During the optimization procedure, chord length at each blade section is corrected by a modification on the local thrust coefficient in order to prevent cavitation. The hydraulic parameters as lift, drag and minimum pressure coefficients are calculated by XFoil. Additionally, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques are used to validate the proposed methodology. Cavitation volume in the water flow through the rotor, with and without geometrical modifications, is evaluated using a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach coupled to the Rayleigh-Plesset model to estimate the vapor production rate. The methodology is applied to the design of a 10 m diameter Hydrokinetic Turbine (HT) rated to 250 kW output power, for a flow velocity of 2.5 m/s. The flow around the optimized rotor presents a reduction of the vapor volume without a major variation upon the turbine output power. A comparison with the Horizontal Axis Rotor Performance Optimization (HARP_opt) code was carried out, demonstrating good behavior. CFD simulations revealed that the proposed design method minimizes cavitation inception, yielding a useful tool for efficient HT design at rated conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of wind induced hydrodynamic changes on destratification and hypoxia reduction were investigated at the Meiling bay (N 31 degrees 22 ' 56.4 '', E 120 degrees 9 ' 38.3 '') of Lake Taihu, China. Vertical flow velocity profile analysis showed surface flow velocities consistency with the wind field and lower flow velocity profiles were also consistent (but with delay response time) when the wind speed was higher than 6.2 m/s. Wind field and temperature found the control parameters for hypoxia reduction and for water quality conditions at the surface and bottom profiles of lake. The critical temperature for hypoxia reduction at the surface and the bottom profile was <= 24.1C degrees (below which hypoxic conditions were found reduced). Strong prevailing wind field (onshore wind directions ESE, SE, SSE and E, wind speed ranges of 2.4-9.1 m/s) reduced the temperature (22C degrees to 24.1C degrees) caused reduction of hypoxia at the near surface with a rise in water levels whereas, low to medium prevailing wind field did not supported destratification which increased temperature resulting in increased hypoxia. Non-prevailing wind directions (offshore) were not found supportive for the reduction of hypoxia in study area due to less variable wind field. Daytime wind field found more variable (as compared to night time) which increased the thermal destratification during daytime and found supportive for destratification and hypoxia reduction. The second order exponential correlation found between surface temperature and Chlorophyll-a (R-2:0.2858, Adjusted R-square: 0.2144 RMSE: 4.395), Dissolved Oxygen (R-2: 0.596, Adjusted R-square: 0.5942, RMSE: 0.3042) concentrations. The findings of the present study reveal the driving mechanism of wind induced thermal destratification and hypoxic conditions, which may further help to evaluate the wind role in eutrophication process and algal blooms formation in shallow water environments.Outcome: Wind field is the key control factor for thermal destratification and hypoxia reduction. 24.1C degrees is the critical/threshold temperature for hypoxia, Chlorophyll-a and NH3-N concentrations of the shallow freshwater lake.

However, a small number of them have taken into account mobile sediment bed effects. The aim of the present work is to study the impact of the presence of a horizontal-axis three bladed turbine with the flow and a mobile sediment bed. We use a series of laboratory experiments with a scaled modelled turbine installed in a flume with a mobile sandy bed at the bottom. Acoustic instruments were used to monitor flow, suspended sediment and bed behaviour. Results show a velocity decrease of about 50% throughout the water column and no flow recovery after a distance of 15 rotor diameters. Clearly visible ripples in the absence of the model turbine were replaced by horseshoe-shaped scour pit in the near wake region, and a depositional heap in the far wake. Suspended sediment differences were recorded in the streamwise direction with a possible effect of the wake as far as 15 rotor diameters. These results imply potentially important effects on the efficiency of turbine arrays, if the flow were to be lower than expected, on turbine foundations and modify coastal sediment transport.

This paper presents a case study of the Upper Ordovician Wufeng-Lower Silurian Longmaxi formation in southeast Sichuan Basin to fully describe the characteristics of shale pore structure in different lithofacies. 16 types of shale lithofacies were classified using ternary diagram of siliceous minerals (quartz + feldspar, QF), carbonate minerals (Ca) and clay minerals (Cl). Among all, argillaceous-rich siliceous shale lithofacies (S-3), argillaceous/siliceous mixed shale lithofacies (M-2) and siliceous-rich argillaceous shale lithofacies (CM-1) are the predominant lithofacies. According to scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, combined with focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and gas adsorption (N-2 and CO2), the pore structure characteristics and its influencing factors were systematically analyzed. The results show that Illite + illite/smectite minerals primarily influence the development of the inorganic pores in mixed clay and silica lithofacies (CM-1). Clay minerals are protected from compaction by the rigid minerals, which significantly favors the development of mesopores (2-50 nm) and macropores ( > 50 nm). The abundance of organic matter is an important determinant for the organic pores in the siliceous lithofacies (S-3), and TOC has a positive contribution to the development of micropores ( < 2 nm) in this lithofacies. Shale with high TOC content tends to be easily affected by compaction, which results in reduction of some organic pores. Even though the siliceous S-3 reservoir has slightly lower porosity than CM-1, it is currently the primary reservoir target due to its brittle response to hydraulic fracturing.",,,,,,,,,34,4,0,0,0,0,38,,,1875-5100,2212-3865,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Geosci Wuhan, Minist Educ, Key Lab Tecton & Petr Resources, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R ChinaUniv Utah, EGI, Salt Lake City, UT 84108 USAChina Univ Petr East China, Res Inst Unconvent Oil & Gas & Renewable Energy, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R ChinaYangtze Univ, Sch Geosci, Wuhan 430100, Hubei, Peoples R China",,,,2018-09-25,WOS:000444521300017,,

Obtaining an accurate mathematical representation of the shale pore system, which can potentially aid in the numerical modeling of its hydraulic and mechanical behavior under a variety of field conditions, has been one of the most significant challenges in the studies of shale gas. In this study, a numerical fitting model was proposed to quantitatively characterize the multimodal pore size distribution (PSD) of the shale pore structure and produce fitting parameters with physical significance. Based on the fitting model and experimental data from mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) and nitrogen gas (N-2) adsorption tests, the pore structure evolution of marine Longmaxi shale was investigated. The sample was tested in various field conditions, such as with different extents of heterogeneity, quantities of clay and organic matter, cryogenic treatments and types of fracturing fluids. It was found that specimen milling decreased the macropore volume. Upon hydration and oven drying, the reorganization of clay and organic matter decreased the mesopore space and increased the micropore space, while the total pore volume remained relatively constant. In addition, cryogenic treatment of hydrated specimens gave rise to a remarkable expansion in either macro- or mesopore volume, especially when hydrated by a viscous fluid. Based on this analysis, a method for estimating the pore volume of shale under reservoir conditions is recommended. Supplemental field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) tests were also conducted to reveal the evolution of internal surface structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J,,,,,,,,,Qing-Chang Zhong,,Developing Fundamental Theory and Enabling Technologies for Parallel Operation of Inverters to Facilitate Large-scale Utilisation of Renewable Energy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 01 2013,2013,"UK Research Councils have set up a RCUK Energy Programme, investing more than £530 million in research and skills to pioneer a low carbon future. Energy is also a major application area funded by TSB. Several major global companies, including BP, Caterpillar, EDF Energy, E.On, Rolls-Royce and Shell, have joined their forces with the UK government to establish the Energy Technologies Institute, creating a potential £1billion investment fund for new energy technologies. The ongoing research programmes cover various aspects of energy from generation, transmission to end use, in order to create affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for heat, power and transport. Increasing the share of renewable energy, e.g. wind, solar, marine and biomass, and improving energy efficiency are the two most important ultimate goals for all energy-related programmes. The renewable energy needs to be connected to the grid, preferably, via inverters in order for them to take part in the grid regulation, in particular, for large-scale renewable installations. However, the capacity of individual power inverters is limited and multiple inverters are needed to be operated in parallel to achieve the power capacity needed. For a 5GW offshore wind power site, 1000 of 5MW inverters are needed. How to make sure that the inverters will share the load proportionally/evenly is a challenge. It should not be assumed that inverters could be connected in parallel automatically. Without proper mechanisms in place, circulating currents may appear and some inverters may be overloaded, which may cause damage. The system may even become unstable and lead to unwanted behaviours. The parallel operation of inverters has been a major problem in industry that prevents the large-scale utilisation of renewable energy sources. This is a simple problem which has not been solved properly for many years. The conventional droop control strategy is a promising technology but the sharing accuracy cannot be guaranteed. Very recently, the PI has revealed that the conventional droop control scheme and its variants do not possess a mechanism to make sure that the sharing accuracy is robust against numerical computational errors, parameter drifts and component mismatches. A robust droop controller is then proposed, which is able to maintain accurate sharing of real power and reactive power at the same time and also to maintain good voltage regulation when the inverters are of the same type. The problem is still unsolved when the inverters are different. The major aims of the project are to develop fundamental understanding about parallel-operated inverters and to develop enabling contorl technologies to facilitate the large-scale utilisation of renewable energy and distributed generation. The ultimate goals of the project are to develop universal control strategies that allow the parallel operation of inverters with different types of output impedances and to develop a fundamental theory to guarantee the stable operation of power systems with parallel-operated inverters.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/J01558X/1,,,,,,,,University of Sheffield,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15304475,,

A series of filled fiber assemblies were prepared from 100% polypropylene, kapok, and milkweed fibers and another series of bonded structured fiber assemblies were prepared from a 70/30 blend of kapok and polypropylene fibers and a 70/30 blend of milkweed and polypropylene fibers. It was observed that the porosity of the fiber assemblies played a very important role in determining its oil sorption capacity. The polypropylene fiber assembly exhibited the highest sorption capacity (g/g) followed by the kapok and milkweed fiber assemblies at porosity < 0.98. At higher porosities (above 0.98). polypropylene filled fiber assembly has poor sorption capacity due to large sized inter fiber pore. The kapok and milkweed fibers have intra fiber porosities of 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. All the fiber assemblies showed higher oil sorption capacity with the high density oil as compared to the diesel oil. As the kapok and milkweed fiber have low cellulose content, hence their slow degradation is an advantage in fresh and marine water applications. The good sorption capacity of kapok and milkweed fiber assemblies along with their biodegradable nature offer great scope for structuring them into fiber assemblies with large porosity and uniform pores to have efficient oil sorbents.

An experimental measurement from structural behavior under harsh marine environmental conditions is necessary to reduce this uncertainty in practical structural monitoring process of jacket structures. As an alternative, a novel and robust simplified methodology based on the empirical investigation could be a practical approach of better understanding the structures integrity. Hence, these methodologies are often termed as model reduction schemes. In this article, model reduction schemes include simplified platform model and static reduction. This work introduces a structural integrity assessment strategy for jacket structures based on the finite element (FE) model updating and a novel simplified method. Hereof, model reducing and model updating procedure is established based on a novel optimization technique. Since the number of measured degrees of freedom is most of the time restricted in practice, this paper represents a methodology using the cross model cross mode (CMCM) method in combination with an iterative procedure which uses limited, spatially incomplete modal information. One of the important advantages associated with the proposed method is that measuring the rotational degrees of freedoms, which is most of the time very expensive and inaccurate, is not needed.This research is an empirical study on a laboratory model of a jacket structure with the aim of establishing Refined Simplified FE Model (i.e. RSM) to conduct damage detection. The studied jacket structure is a reduced scale 2D frame fabricated and tested at the Laboratory of Modal Analysis of the Tabriz University, Iran. Hereof, experimental vibration tests are accomplished on a physical 2D platform model to record dynamic responses and acquire dynamic features of damaged structure. In addition to eliminate the uncertainty effects in the damage detection results, FtSM technique is employed because of practical considerations and also this technique provides a fast damage zone diagnosis procedure. Also, improved reduction scheme is utilized based on static reduction scheme to carry out damage detection in jacket structure. Improved reduction technique eliminates the bad influence of model reduction procedure on the proposed new methodology. The results demonstrate that the presented new technique is completely successful in conducing damage identification in jacket structures.",,,,,,,,,8,1,0,0,0,0,8,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tabriz, Civil Engn Dept, Tabriz 5166616471, Iran",,,,2017-11-15,WOS:000414886600013,,

Then, the Ni(II)/(Zn(II) + Ni(II)) atomic ratio in starting solution (X-Ni) was 0-0.10. XRD results indicated that crystallization of the layered structure of ZHC was strongly inhibited with an increase of X-Ni and no new particles were generated. The Ni(II) was incorporated into ZHC crystal by substitution with Zn(II) and the Ni/(Zn + Ni) molar ratio in the particles was almost consistent with X-Ni. The ZHC particles formed at X-Ni = 0 were hexagonal plate with a size of ca. 3.2 mu m and a thickness of ca. 0.3 mu m. Increasing X-Ni reduced the size and thickness of ZHC particles. Besides, addition of Ni(II) suppressed the adsorption of CO2 and SO2 gasses on ZHC, because of layered structure of this material to be disintegrated. The foregoing results suggest that atmospheric corrosion of Zn-Ni alloy coating in marine zone forms dense and compact zinc rust layer composed of fine Ni(II)-doped ZHC particles with a low affinity to corrosive gasses on the steels, leading to the suppression of further corrosion of steel. Also, role of Ni on the atmospheric corrosion of Zn-Ni alloy coating in marine zone can be suggested by studying the structure and properties of artificial Ni(II)-doped ZHC rust particles.

The purpose of this study is to investigate dynamic response of pipes conveying fluid with variable wall thickness through both circumferential and axial directions. Pipes with variable wall thickness have different flexural rigidities about two different principal axes. This property allows these pipes to be oriented efficiently, meet various design requirements and resist the applied loads. The results of this investigation provide a better insight into the physics and dynamic behavior of noncircular pipes conveying fluid. Two different geometries are studied, (i) the pipe is assumed with a general non-circular cross section with variable wall thickness along the circumferential direction, (ii) both inner and outer boundaries of the pipe cross section are assumed to be circles whereas the wall thickness of the pipe along axial direction is varied with a specified function. The governing differential equations of the problem are derived using Timoshenko beam theory with the effect of shear deformation included in the formulation. The discretization of the problem domain is done using the finite element method. Consequently, a modal analysis is employed to calculate the critical flow velocities of the pipe with clamped-clamped end conditions. The effects of different cross sections on the critical flow velocity are investigated.

However, CH4 in the martian atmosphere also could be attributable to geologic emissions released through pathways similar to those occurring on Earth. Using recent data on methane degassing of the Earth, we have estimated the relative terrestrial contributions of fossil geologic methane vs. modern methane from living methanogens, and have examined the significance that various geologic sources might have for Mars.Geologic degassing includes microbial methane (produced by ancient methanogens), thermogenic methane (from maturation of sedimentary organic matter), and subordinately geothermal and volcanic methane (mainly produced abiogenically). Our analysis suggests that similar to 80% of the natural emission to the terrestrial atmosphere originates from modern microbial activity and similar to 20% originates from geologic degassing, for a total CH4 emission of similar to 28.0 x 10(7) tonnes year(-1).Estimates of methane emission on Mars range from 12.6 x 10(1) to 57.0 x 10(4) tonnes year(-1) and are 3-6 orders of magnitude lower than that estimated for Earth. Nevertheless, the recently detected martian, Northern-Summer-2003 CH4 plume could be compared with methane expulsion from large mud volcanoes or from the integrated emission of a few hundred gas seeps, such as many of those located in Europe, USA, Mid-East or Asia. Methane could also be released by diffuse microseepage from martian soil, even if macro-seeps or mud volcanoes were lacking or inactive. We calculated that a weak microseepage spread over a few tens of km(2), as frequently occurs on Earth, may be sufficient to generate the lower estimate of methane emission in the martian atmosphere.At least 65% of Earth's degassing is provided by kerogen thermogenesis. A similar process may exist on Mars, where kerogen might include abiogenic organics (delivered by meteorites and comets) and remnants of possible, past martian life. The remainder of terrestrial degassed methane is attributed to fossil microbial gas (similar to 25%) and geothermal-volcanic emissions (similar to 10%). Global abiogenic emissions from serpentinization are negligible on Earth, but, on Mars, individual seeps from serpentinization could be significant. Gas discharge from clathrate-permafrost destabilization should also be considered.Finally, we have shown examples of potential degassing pathways on Mars, including mud volcano-like structures, fault and fracture systems, and major volcanic edifices. All these types of structures could provide avenues for extensive gas expulsion, as on Earth. Future investigations of martian methane should be focused on such potential pathways.

The ramp developed near the equator in the Mount Head Embayment: a broad, basement-controlled regional domnwarp and oceanic bight. The ramp is divided into inner, middle and outer zones based on gross lithology and degree of winnowing. The inner ramp comprises muddy carbonates that accumulated predominantly in calm-water in shallow-subtidal settings and subaerially on sabkhas. The middle ramp is characterized by grainy carbonates deposited in shoals and current-swept banks under turbulent-cater and wave-agitated conditions. The outer ramp consists of muddy carbonates that accumulated predominantly as tempestites and periplatform ooze in open-marine and slope settings.Evolution of the ramp is constrained by multiple-group biostratigraphy and sequence stratigraphy and is shown on eight chronostratigraphic slice maps of approximately 1.5 Ma duration each. In addition, the ramp is characterized by three distinct biotic associations, chloroforam, bryoderm-extended and bryoderm. These are similar to Upper Carboniferous-Permian biotic associations interpreted by others to be indicators of depositional temperature; namely warm-water for the first association, cool-water for the second and cold-water for the third. Deposits of the warm-water chloroforam association in Mount Head Embayment are represented by ooid grainstone shoals, shallow-subtidal limestones and peritidal sabkha dolostones with anhydrite. In contrast, cool-waters are represented by shallow-subtidal dolo-mudstones that have a bryoderm-extended biotic association. Cold-waters are represented by reworked pelmatozoan-grainstone banks that have a bryoderm biotic association. Mixed warm- and cool-water indicators occur in deeper-water winnowed grainy carbonates, open-marine wackestones and slope mudstones of the mid and outer ramp. These rocks contain faunal elements of the cool-water bryoderm-extended association along with ooids and dasycladacean algae of the chloroforam association. Ooids and dasyclads are transported, occur with tempestites and represent redistribution of materials from higher on the ramp. The ooids and dasyclads do not reflect conditions at the site of accumulation. Additional evidence for cold-water sedimentation is provided by syndepositional pseudomorphs after ikaite. These are common in deep, outer-ramp rocks and rare in inner-ramp, shallow-subtidal dolostones. Ikaite is a known carbonate paleothermometer that is thermodynamically constrained to temperatures less than 7 degrees C.Biotic association/temperature maps indicate that during lowstand systems tracts, cool- and cold-water masses blanketed most of the ramp and occurred in well-defined belts. Warm-water masses were rare. In contrast, during transgressive systems tracts, the pattern is more complex, with a mosaic of warm, warm and cool, cool and cold waters occurring over the ramp. The presence of both cold- and warm-water masses is probably the result of upwelling cold waters and solar heating of shallow, nearshore and offshore water. Upwelling would be driven by trade winds or by offshore oceanic current systems. Differences between lowstand and transgressive systems tracts may be the result of more efficient redistribution of ramp waters during lowstands. At these times, trade winds forcing surficial waters offshore over a much-narrowed ramp would more effectively maintain upwelling. Alternatively, on a narrower ramp, offshore oceanic currents may accelerate during lowstands and therefore intensify upwelling conditions. Lastly, palinspastic restorations indicate that the middle-ramp grainy carbonate belt was extremely broad. The width of this belt may have been the result of swell- and storm-wave sweeping beginning in deep, offshore waters and extending progressively shoreward into shallow water, as occurs along the present day coast of south Australia.",,,,,Conference on Cool-Water CarbonatesConference on Cool-Water Carbonates,"JAN 14-19, 1995JAN 14-19, 1995","Geol Soc Austr, Austr Sedimentol Res GrpGeol Soc Austr, Austr Sedimentol Res Grp","GEELONG, AUSTRALIAGEELONG, AUSTRALIA",27,1,0,0,9,0,30,,,,,1-56576-034-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,1997-01-01,WOS:A1997BJ19L00022,,

In the United States, this is evident by the creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in January 2003 and the similar restructuring of allied anti-terrorist efforts to prevent the occurrence of further catastrophic events in their countries. Immediate actions have been taken that are resulting in the overhaul of airport, harbor, and transportation security, ranging from advanced surveillance to active defense of vital infrastructures to prevent disruptions of services, such as global communications and the internet. A key element of terrorism countermeasures is the collection and timely evaluation of data which may forecast or thwart terrorist actions. Today, use of underwater fiber optic communications cables is the preferred technology to provide inexpensive, secure voice and data transport throughout the world. By definition, undersea cable systems, used for telecommunications, military surveillance, electrical power distribution, scientific monitoring of oceans or subsea oil and gas distribution pipeline monitoring are within the purview of the Department of Homeland Security. These critical assets have drawn the attention of terrorists; therefore, the underwater community, as well as the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) directorate, must continue to exercise pro-active security to prevent catastrophes from occurring from what must be considered a nameless and daring enemy. Therefore, protection planning and implementation for underwater systems technologies, cable stations, terrestrial backhaul facilities, maritime resources and cable ships are undergoing major refinements to safeguard against acts of terrorism and to provide secure restoration. In addition to government efforts, the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) considers recommendations for security enhancements for the individual facility owners and operators. Efforts including the implementation voluntary security plans by the American Petroleum Institute (API) for off-shore structures and the American Chemical Counsel (ACC) for the chemical manufacturing and transportation industry demonstrate that private industry is a key player in national anti-terrorism defenses. Pro-active support roles are evolving for new Unmanned Marine Vehicles (UMV), that encompass Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV), Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV), and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) and the evolving hybrid Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV). These maritime robotic vehicles are capable of supporting faster, more accurate surveys, deeper burial of fiber optic systems, advanced cable locating technologies, and expanded subsea surveillance. Risk assessment of theatre specific events has resulted in the demand for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) patrolling littoral areas and critical subsea infrastructures.

Simulations consist of discretizing and integrating the partial differential equations governing fluid flow and transport forward in time, providing solutions for physical variables (fields such as velocity and pressure) as function of time and space in the entire domain of interest. Since such simulations generate enormous amounts of data, the prevailing approach has been for researchers to analyze the data on the fly during the simulation runs while only a small subset of time-steps are stored for subsequent analysis. As a result, often large simulations of the same process must be repeated after new questions arise that were not initially obvious. Many (or even most) breakthrough concepts cannot be anticipated in advance, as they will be motivated in part by output data and must then be tested against it. As a result, there is a need for methods to store entire space-time data from such simulations. This project develops innovative tools for the efficient creation of open numerical databases that contain massive outputs from computational fluid dynamics simulations used in turbulence research and geophysical transport modeling and makes these available to the entire community. Several of the datasets to be included into the Open Numerical Laboratory will be contributed by external researchers. In addition to enhancing engineering and geophysical fluid mechanics and turbulence research, democratized access to large-scale turbulent flow simulation data will also play a crucial role in education and training for the next generation of researchers. Active learning through new educational modules that allow students to query simulation datasets in unprecedented detail will provide new educational paradigms. More broadly, the lessons learned from this project will be generalizable to many other fields where numerical simulations generate very large datasets that are difficult to access using prevailing approaches. In this way, the project will enhance the scientific and broader impacts of the US high-performance scientific computing infrastructure. This project will develop innovative tools for the efficient creation of open numerical databases that contain massive outputs from computational fluid dynamics simulations used in turbulence research and geophysical transport modeling. An ingest pipeline to be developed will enable users to transfer data from file systems containing the output of their massive direct numerical simulations, build a database, and serve it to the community for open exploratory data analysis and innovative turbulence and oceanic mixing research. To date, the investigators involved in this project have built an Open Numerical Laboratory focusing on direct numerical simulations (DNS) of canonical turbulent flows, in which the entire space-time data are available to the wider research community. However, the existing datasets are few in number and databases have been created one by one, using methodologies difficult to replicate on a massive scale. Moreover, emerging Exascale simulations will potentially result in data sets of unprecedented scale (tens to hundreds of PetaBytes). Advanced computer science algorithms will be required to tackle these challenges. This project will (a) develop automated, and scalable data management algorithms to ingest, index and serve very large data sets generated by a wide range of groups, (b) explore novel algorithms using spatio-temporal subsampling combined with online interpolation with re-simulation, yielding large compression factors depending on the subsampling stride, and (c) use machine learning algorithms to identify localized regions of interest in the simulations and save these 4D domains in a database for detailed follow-up analytics. The new databases will include data from (1) the largest channel flow DNS, (2) rotating and stratified turbulence of geophysical interest, (3) a DNS of developing wall boundary layer and (4) detailed ocean circulation models with complex boundary conditions. As part of the innovative domain science applications, data sets will be used to improve turbulence models using data-assimilation concepts, study Lagrangian vortex dynamics, and explore geophysical transport in a regional general circulation model of the North Atlantic Ocean.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1633124,,,,,,,,Johns Hopkins University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13881110,,

Gravity models suggest up to 35-40% crustal thinning. The seismic stratigraphy of the basin is continuous with that of the offshore western North Island, where reflectors are well constrained by oil exploration data. In the Reinga Basin, there are two Cretaceous sequences above an older Mesozoic basement. The lower sequence is apparently terrestrial and may include both pre-rift and synrift subsequences; the upper is a rift-filling marine sequence. These are overlain by Paleocene and Eocene blanket sequences that were laid down during a period of relative tectonic quiescence consistent with cooling subsidence, continued submergence, a northeast-facing continental shelf, and absence of a significant active plate boundary. A strong regional reflector, caused by a combined unconformity and Oligocene condensed sequence, separates the Paleogene and Neogene sequences.The Neogene sequences record sedimentary infill from several source directions, not only from the New Zealand landmass, but from the north and west as well. Near the Northland coast, sediment accumulated in elastic wedges and ponded sub-basins from the Miocene to the present day. Along the flanking ridges to the northwest, similar deposition occurred in the Early and Middle Miocene but changed in the Late Miocene to sedimentation in drifts flanked by scours. This change reflects the end of tectonism, a diminishing elastic sediment supply and the establishment of a throughgoing oceanic current regime as the marginal ridges submerged. This pattern of sedimentation persists today.Post-Cretaceous volcanism occurred in two parts of the basin. In the central southeastern part, volcanic bodies in the ?Oligocene to Early Miocene sequences could be a northwestern extension of the Northland volcanic are. In the western part, small intrusive and extrusive bodies appear to be of Pliocene intraplate origin.Compression (or transpression) had an important role in developing the basin's present form. Miocene compressional structures-asymmetric anticlines, reverse faults, everted basins, and pop-ups-are present everywhere but at the southeastern end. The present marginal ridges have structurally complex origins. The Reinga Ridge which forms the northeastern margin is a transform boundary with the Norfolk backarc basin. Deformation thought to be caused by the action of the transform is recorded in folded and faulted Cretaceous-Paleogene sequences and syntectonic Early and Middle Miocene sequences along its length. The southwestern margin of the basin is a double ridge comprising the Wanganella Ridge, an early Middle to early Late Miocene, compressional uplift, and the older, eroded West Norfolk Ridge, which contains Cretaceous half-grabens. The northern half of the Wanganella Ridge is an everted ?Oligocene to Early Miocene aulacogen in which slivers of basement rock were thrust up along with the sedimentary fill, whereas the southern half is an uplifted block of folded sedimentary rocks of probable Cretaceous or older age.Paleogeographic reconstructions show that Oligocene uplift of the Norfolk Ridge and Miocene uplift of the Reinga Ridge could have provided a means for terrestrial biota of New Caledonian affinities to spread into New Zealand.The total sediment thickness in the Reinga Basin is estimated to be 3.5-5.5 km. Potential source, seal and reservoir rocks are present, and there is an abundance of suitable structures.

The analysis indicates a secular decrease in generating potential over this interval, with the largest declines observed for western Inner Mongolia (15 +/- 7%) and the northern part of Gansu (17 +/- 8%), two leading wind investment areas. The decrease is associated with long-term warming in the vicinity of the Siberian High (SH), correlated also with the observed secular increase in global average surface temperatures. The long-term trend is modulated by variability relating to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO).

The porosity analyses using nitrogen adsorption measurements and mercury intrusion porosimetry were then evaluated as a function of both composition and thermal maturity. Despite the absence of variation in the pore size distribution and the total pore volume with maturity, which is controlled by total organic carbon content (TOC), this study demonstrates that the pore network of these marine mudstones varies considerably with thermal maturity. Contrary to low-mature samples, whose porosity depends essentially on mineral interparticle pores, the porosity of thermally-mature rocks is mainly influenced by organic-matter-hosted pores located within secondary solid bitumen. Organic matter (OM) porosity, which is rare in the low-mature stage, appears to increase during thermal maturation in response to the thermal cracking of kerogen and oil, to become predominant in gas-mature rocks. It can therefore be considered that thermal maturation is a major process for the development of the OM porosity. However, the OM of high-TOC ( > 5.5 wt%) gas-mature samples contains smaller pores than gas-mature low-TOC mudstones probably due to a difference in the original OM composition between these high- and low-TOC samples. By analogy with the Kimmeridge Clay formation, which is often considered as time equivalent in terms of OM composition (Uliana et al., 1999), the high-TOC Vaca Muerta samples appear to have originally contained greater proportions of oil-prone amorphous OM and thus a better OM intrinsic quality for oil generation. This difference of OM composition and petroleum potential between Vaca Muerta marine mudstones appears to have dramatically influenced the OM-hosted pore genesis during maturation. Consistent with other studies, these results show that thermal maturity is not the only process that can explain OM-hosted pore genesis in gas shale systems. The OM composition can greatly influence the evolution of this porosity during maturation. Organic composition and OM thermal maturity may therefore have a complementary effect, explaining the diversity of trends observed on porosity in natural formations.",,,,,,,,,23,1,0,0,0,0,24,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Orleans, ISTO, UMR 7327, F-45071 Orleans, FranceCNRS, UMR 7327, ISTO, F-45071 Orleans, FranceBur Rech Geol & Minieres, ISTO, UMR 7327, BP 36009, F-45060 Orleans, FranceCNRS, CEMHTI, UPR 3079, F-45071 Orleans, France",,,,2019-06-04,WOS:000466617700021,,
J,,,,,,,,,Margaret Hartley,,How did primordial and recycled geochemical signatures come to coexist in the Earth's deep mantle?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 23 2017,2017,"The transport and cycling of volatile elements between the solid Earth, oceans and atmosphere has shaped the evolution of our planet. Chemical fluxes of volatiles to and from long-term mantle reservoirs are maintained by convective and tectonic processes. However, the mechanisms that control the volatile budgets of distinct mantle reservoirs remain uncertain. Major questions include: How did the Earth acquire its initial volatile inventory? What was the closure age of the mantle to atmosphere loss? How has crustal recycling modified mantle volatile reservoirs? What is the spatial distribution of primordial and recycled volatiles in the mantle? The key objective of this project is to provide a new understanding of spatial and temporal relationships between primordial and recycled sources in the Earth's mantle, underpinned by high-precision geochemical data and detailed statistical modelling. We will achieve this by interrogating combined noble gas isotope compositions and halogen contents in an exceptional suite of subglacially erupted basalts from Iceland that map a high-resolution transect across a mantle plume. The samples preserve geochemical signatures of melts from both ancient sources and the shallow convecting mantle, which has been extensively modified by melt extraction and recycling over geologic time. The unparalleled high-resolution, spatially continuous sample of the mantle afforded by erupted basalts from Iceland's neovolcanic zones makes Iceland an ideal natural laboratory for investigating the history of accretion, differentiation, outgassing and recycling in the mantle. The inert noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) provide key geochemical tracers of primordial mantle domains that have remained largely unmodified since the Earth's formation. In contrast, fluid-mobile halogens (F, Cl, Br, I) are reintroduced to the mantle by the subduction of seawater, sediment and altered oceanic crust at destructive plate boundaries, and are therefore key tracers of recycled material in the mantle. There is at present an unresolved dichotomy between existing interpretations of noble gases, halogens and other geochemical tracers such as lithophile isotopes (Sr, Nd, Pb). Lithophile isotopes and halogens provide abundant evidence that mixing, stretching and recycling in the mantle has created highly heterogeneous lithological and spatial structure beneath Iceland. However, noble gas isotopes indicate that some parts of the Icelandic mantle retain primordial, unprocessed geochemical signatures. A crucial limitation of previous work is that lithophile elements and isotopes, major volatiles and noble gases have been analysed in different sample sets, such that we cannot combine the sensitivities of different elements to obtain robust constraints on mantle sources. By bringing these data into a single coherent framework, this project provides the first opportunity to interrogate simultaneously multiple geochemical proxies to probe the spatial and temporal relationships between primordial and recycled mantle sources.We will use state-of-the-art mass spectrometry techniques to provide new independent constraints on halogen and noble gas decoupling in the mantle, and the extent of halogen loss from different mantle reservoirs in the early Earth. We will provide the first high-precision analysis of the Kr-isotopic composition of the Earth's primordial mantle, and a new, precise determination of iodine abundance in the mantle. We will perform the first combined spatial statistics analysis of noble gas, halogen and lithophile isotope data to determine the location and distribution of primordial and recycled reservoirs in a mantle plume, providing key insights into the structure and dynamics of the mantle. Our results will provide a guide to interpreting mantle geochemical and spatial structure at other ocean islands on Earth, and will feed into ongoing efforts to model volatile budgets and volatile cycling on other planetary bodies.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/P002331/1,,,,,,,,University of Manchester,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15358179,,

Ice formation can heavily compromise the mechanical integrity and energy efficiency of systems such as aircraft, marine structures, power grids, wind turbines, and HVAC systems. The economic cost of ice formation amounts to billions of dollars every year. Active methods of removing ice include spraying chemicals or using electric heating, but such techniques are environmentally and energetically costly. Surfaces that could, by themselves, suppress the growth of ice for many hours or even days would therefore be highly advantageous, but to date, no such surface exists. This proposal seeks to develop smart surfaces that suppress the growth of ice without any mechanical or electrical intervention, leaving the majority of the surface dry even under chilled and humid conditions. The proposed surface will have miniscule structures that will guide the deposition of water in such a way as to reduce ice formation. System optimization will be obtained by modeling the thermodynamics and fluid dynamics of vapor transfer in vapor-liquid-ice multiphase systems, which could also shed fundamental insight on the behavior of mixed-phase clouds. The objective of this proposal is to gain a fundamental understanding of the localized pressure gradients and resulting source-sink interactions between ice, water, and water vapor and to exploit this knowledge to passively suppress the in-plane growth of frost. Using a combination of experimental, theoretical, and computational techniques, the following research tasks are proposed: (1) Characterizing Inter-Droplet Frost Growth: In-plane and out-of-plane inter-droplet ice bridging between a frozen droplet and supercooled liquid droplet will be characterized using a custom-built humidity chamber and hydrophobic surfaces bonded to Peltier stages. The resulting data will be correlated with an evolving-boundary computational model. (2) Creating a Dry Zone around Ice: When a water droplet is frozen before surrounding condensate has a chance to grow appreciably, a stable dry zone forms between the ice droplet and the condensation. An isolated droplet will be frozen just above the dew point and then the humidity will be raised to observe and model the resulting dry zone. (3) Suppression of In-Plane Frost Growth: With the knowledge gained from the previous two tasks, a controlled array of microscopic stripes of ice will be formed on a chemically and/or physically patterned surface, such that the dry zone about each stripe of ice will overlap to keep the vast majority of the surface dry from condensate and frost. A fuller understanding of inter-droplet evaporation and ice bridging in mixed-phase water systems will clarify the thermodynamics and fluid dynamics of frost growth on surfaces and give experimental insight to the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process of glaciation in mixed-phase clouds. Furthermore, the proposed research will map out the critical phase space where the vapor gradients result in ice bridging versus dry zones.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1604272,,,,,,,,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13775609,,

The water tunnel test of this three-bladed, horizontal-axis rotor recorded power production, blade loading, the near-wake flow, cavitation effects, and noise generation. These state-of-the-art measurements demonstrate much of the complex physics associated with the flow through an unducted, horizontal-axis turbine, and they elucidate the performance characteristics and flow field effects at an unprecedented fidelity, accuracy and resolution. Measurements of power coefficients (power, torque and thrust) as a function of tip-speed-ratio were performed. The dataset also includes unsteady measurements of driveshaft loading, blade strain, tower pressures, and radiated noise. Detailed flow mapping using laser Doppler velocimetry, and planar and stereo particle image velocimetry includes measurements of mean velocity and Reynolds stresses. Although the wake measurements are limited to less than half a diameter, they reveal the complex flow patterns in the near-wake structure of the rotor.

J,,,,,,,,,Matteo Carpentieri,,Experimental study of atmospheric stratification in environmental flows (StratEnFlo),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Nov 01 2016,2016,"Poor urban air quality and the threat of terrorist attacks by spreading hazardous substances in cities are a real concern for everyone. In order to prevent health hazards and to plan emergency procedures effectively, we need to be able to predict and simulate how gases and particles spread. A number of mathematical models currently exist that are able to simulate flow and dispersion with reasonable speed and accuracy at the required small scales, however there are still huge gaps in our knowledge and these models do not work well in all conditions. One of the main problems that current models display is in the way they treat atmospheric stratification. The proposed research will tackle this problem and will establish the role of thermal stratification in flow and dispersion in urban areas.Stratification is common in environmental flows. This is due, for example, to variations in temperature and humidity with height in the atmosphere, or to variations in temperatures and salinity in the oceans. Neutral atmospheric stratification is characterised by an adiabatic profile of potential temperature, meaning that vertical motions of fluid particles are neither amplified nor damped. On the other hand, vertical movements are enhanced in unstable stratification, while stable flows are characterised by attenuated vertical motion.Although stratification plays a very important role in atmospheric flow and dispersion, the vast majority of studies focus only on neutral flows, mainly because they are simpler to treat either experimentally or numerically. The proposed research aims to start bridging this gap using one of the very few facilities in Europe, or for that matter the world, that is capable of simulating non-neutral atmospheric boundary layer flows. In meteorology and in mesoscale air quality models, stratification is an important feature, with parametrisations that are usually accurate enough to capture the main behaviour of the flow in different conditions of stability. At smaller scales, however, these relatively simple parametrisations are inadequate. While other small scale features, such as local geometry, may also become more important in determining flow conditions at such scales, stratification plays a significant role.The prevalence of non-neutral atmospheric stratification (either stable or unstable) is well known, and a number of studies have highlighted the important effects this has on flow and dispersion. Systematic laboratory studies, however, are very rare, due to the complexity of the physical system to be studied and the very few facilities in the world capable of simulating a deep, non-neutral boundary layer. Because of this lack of experimental data-sets, most current mathematical parametrisations that account for this very important effect were developed using data from neutral test cases, sparse and rather uncertain field measurements, and some theoretical reasoning. The capabilities of the EnFlo laboratory offer a unique opportunity to bridge this gap in current models.The main purpose of the proposed research is to establish the role of thermal stratification, both external and local, on flow and dispersion within an array of building-like obstacles. Experimental methodologies to simulate these issues will also be refined and further developed, as no established procedures and strategies currently exist. The principal outcome of the work will be a better understanding of the physics of this kind of atmospheric flow, focussing mainly in flow and pollutant dispersion within the urban canopy (particularly below roof level). A systematic experimental database on flow and dispersion in non-neutral flows will be produced. The data-set will help develop parametrisations and mathematical models able to predict atmospheric flow and dispersion at small scales more reliably, for example in urban areas or in wind farms.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/P000029/1,,,,,,,,University of Surrey,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15351176,,

Three experimental groups, i.e. ELF-EMF unexposed control group (C), ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 100 mu T) exposed E1 group, and ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 500 mu T) exposed E2 group, were set, and coelomocytes were collected to analyze. The results showed that total coelomocyte and spherulocyte density in E1 group increased significantly compared to groups C and E2 (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences on amoebocyte and chromatocyte density among groups C, E1 and E2. ELF-EMF exposure could significantly increase immune-related enzyme activities in coelomic fluid of O. struma, including acidic phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, antioxidative capacity, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and polyphenol oxidase (P < 0.05). A total of 54.32 Mb and 55.27 Mb raw reads with average length of 1520 bp were obtained from coelomocytes of O. struma in unexposed and exposed groups, respectively.

The SQG equation has been very useful in modeling large-scale motions of atmosphere and oceans such as the frontogenesis, the formation of sharp fronts between masses of hot and cold air. The Boussinesq equation has also been successful in modeling many geophysical flows such as atmospheric fronts and ocean circulations. In addition, the Boussinesq equation is also at the center of turbulence theories concerning turbulent thermal convection. Mathematically, the SQG equation and the 2D Boussinesq equation serve as lower dimensional models of the three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics equations. In fact, they both retain the key features of the 3D Navier-Stokes and the 3D Euler equations such as the vortex stretching mechanism. The proposed study on these 2D models may shed light on the mystery surrounding the 3D equations. This project focuses on the fundamental issue of whether physically relevant solutions to these equations are globally regular for all time or they develop singularities. The objective here is to introduce new ideas and develop effective techniques to solve the outstanding open global regularity problem on the supercritical SQG equation and on the Boussinesq equation with partial or no dissipation. Extensive large numerical simulations will be performed to provide insight to the underlying dynamics and novel estimates via dedicated tools from harmonic analysis and differential equations will be derived to gauge the large-time behavior of their solutions. The award will support Ph.D. students in mathematics at Oklahoma State University. Partial differential equations are fundamental tools in understanding many fluid phenomena ranging from small scale blood flows to large-scale geophysical flows and have played pivotal roles in many practical applications involving fluid flows. Outstandingly among them are the Navier-Stokes equations, which are widely used for describing phenomena that are as varied as lubrication in machine equipment, airflow around a wind turbine, oceanic flows, and large scale atmospheric flows that are responsible for cold fronts and the jet stream. The study and use of the full Navier-Stokes equation is notoriously difficult and there are still fundamental open questions associated with them. Researchers have therefore developed several simplified versions of these equations that still retain some of their fundamental properties. These partial differential equations have been at the center of numerous analytical, experimental and numerical investigations. One of the most prominent problems concerning these equations is whether all of their classical solutions are global in time. An affirmative answer would suggest that they may be valid even in extremal flow situations and that it makes sense to attempt to solve them with computational methods, while a negative answer will point to possible limitations of their use and to inherent difficulties when a numerical solution is attempted. This problem can be extremely challenging and remains open in many important cases. The main goal of this project is to create new strategies and develop effective techniques to further advance the research on and improve our understanding of this difficult problem. The emphasis will be on unconventional approaches that combine methods and tools from different mathematical disciplines such as fluid mechanics, harmonic analysis and numerical simulations. The project will integrate research with education, promoting teaching and training of students. Four Ph.D. students will work with the PI on various aspects of the problems that will be tackled with this award and will be trained in the use of a wide variety of mathematical techniques. In addition, the PI will organize several specialized scientific conferences and conference sessions during the award period, which will involve and support junior mathematicians as well as researchers from under-represented groups.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1209153,,,,,,,,Oklahoma State University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14006671,,

For complex coastal morphodynamic problems or in the vicinity of complex coastal structures, such as harbours, EWS are much less used because they are both technically and computationally still very challenging. To advance beyond the state-of-the-art, the EU FP7 project RISC-KIT (www.risc-kit.eu) is developing prototype EWS which address specifically these topics. This paper describes the prototype EWS which has been developed for the case study site of the harbour of Zeebrugge, situated in Flanders along the Belgian coast, allowing the validation of the newly developed tools. The challenge for this EWS and DSS (Decision Support System) is selecting the right number, type, and detail of the models in order to get a sufficiently detailed and trustable results, while keeping calculation time limited in order to allow fast and frequent predictions.In general, waves inside harbours are a combination of locally generated wind waves and offshore wave penetration at the port entrance. Outside a prediction environment, the conditions inside the harbour could be assessed by superimposing processes. The assessment can be carried out by using a combination of a spectral wave model (i.e. SWAN) for the wind generated waves and a Boussinesq type wave model (i.e. Mike 21 BW) for the offshore wave penetration. Finally, a 2D hydrodynamic model (i.e. TELEMAC) can be used to simulate the overland flooding inside the port facilities.To reproduce these processes under a EWS environment, an additional challenge is to cope with the limitations of the calculation times. This is especially true with the Boussinesq model. A model train that integrates process based modelling, for wind generated waves, with a smart simplification of the Boussinesq model for the wave penetration effects, is proposed. These wave conditions together with the extreme water levels (including storm surge) can then be used to simulate the overtopping/overflow behaviour for the quays. Finally, the hydrodynamic model TELEMAC is run for the inundations inside the port facilities. The complete model train was integrated into the Deltares Delft-FEWS software for scenario simulating to showcase the potential for real time operations.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,0,18,,,0378-3839,1872-7379,,,,,,,,,,"IMDC Nv, Immerseelstr 66, B-2018 Antwerp, Belgium",IMDC Nv,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000428492400018,,

J,,,,,,,,,Duncan Lockerby,,Nano-Engineered Flow Technologies: Simulation for Design across Scale and Phase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2016,2016,"Over the next 25 years, society will face major challenges in health, transportation, energy and climate that will demand novel engineering solutions. Recent rapid advances in device and materials fabrication offer an important opportunity to help meet these challenges by enabling new technologies to be engineered down to the nanometre scale. Devices that manipulate fluids at the smallest scales exhibit complex and sometimes counter-intuitive phenomena that present novel scientific and technological opportunities. The scientific opportunity is to understand and model how the microscopic physics at and around phase interfaces drives the overall flow behaviour. The technological opportunity is to exploit this behaviour to design and manufacture devices with unprecedented capabilities. This research Programme is about uncovering the engineering science of flows that are intrinsically multiscale, and encapsulating this in efficient modelling software in order to enable the design of next generation technologies.This Programme aims to underpin future UK innovation in nano-structured and smart interfaces by delivering a simulation-for-design capability for nano-engineered flow technologies, as well as a better understanding of the critical interfacial fluid dynamics. We will produce software that a) resolves interfaces down to the molecular scale, and b) spans the scales relevant to the engineering application. As accurate molecular/particle methods are computationally unfeasible at engineering scales, and efficient but conventional fluids models do not capture the important molecular physics, this is a formidable multiscale problem in both time and space. Our software will have embedded intelligence that decides dynamically on the correct simulation tools needed at each interface location, for every phase combination, and matches these tools to appropriate computational platforms for maximum efficiency.The outcome will be a revolutionary new framework for simulating multiscale multiphysics systems in nature as well as engineering, greatly surpassing current modelling capabilities. The step-change advances this represents include:- predictive simulations of engineering-scale systems with nanoscale fidelity;- new insight into the physics of interfacial flow systems;- computational resources allocated in-simulation to enable more rapid system analysis;- assessment of proposed flow system designs that were not previously amenable to investigation;- accessing trans-disciplinary applications in granular flows and avalanche dynamics, and social/economic systems including urban traffic modelling and financial market stability.This work is strongly supported by 9 external partners, ranging from large multinational companies to an SME. The targeted applications all depend on the behaviour of interfaces that divide phases, and include: radical cancer treatments that exploit nano-bubble cavitation; the cooling of high-power electronics through evaporative nano-menisci; nanowire membranes for separating oil and water, e.g. for oil spills; and smart nano-structured surfaces for drag reduction and anti-fouling, with applications to low-emissions aerospace, automotive and marine transport. These applications make demands on simulation for engineering design that far outstrip current capabilities. Our partners will therefore be 'early-adopters' of this Programme's outcomes in order to meet the technical capabilities they will need to provide in the future.This interdisciplinary research draws on techniques and results across the boundaries of applied mathematics, physics, mechanical engineering, and computing. Its timeliness lies in the convergence of a uniquely-qualified academic team with a group of engaged and committed industrial partners, who will work together to exploit current and emerging nano-engineered flow systems for societal and economic benefit to the UK and elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/N016602/1,,,,,,,,University of Warwick,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15313678,,

In addition, the funding will facilitate participation of 10 invited speakers and panelists who would otherwise be unlikely to attend the conference. The Thermal and Fluids Engineering Conference (TFEC) is an annual conference since 2015 that has grown to become a leading platform for presentation and discussion of research advances in thermal and fluids engineering. In 2020, the conference will take place April 5-8, 2020 in New Orleans, LA. The annual TFEC conference addresses the need for a platform for dissemination and discussion of research results in the fields of heat transfer and fluid mechanics. A number of sessions encompassing the breadth of thermal and fluid transport are currently being organized for the conference. The proposed NSF support will enable a significant intellectual benefit and professional development opportunity for a number of students and early career engineers/faculty from around the country. The participation of invited speakers and panelists enabled by the support will enhance and broaden the technical content of the conference, thereby benefiting all attendees. It is expected that this travel grant will focus research collaborations in multiple areas related to heat transfer and fluids engineering. The in-person platform offered by the conference is expected to lead to interesting and fruitful technical conversations. It is expected that this will lead to novel, collaborative approaches for addressing fundamental and applied problems in thermal and fluids engineering. <br/><br/>Thermal and fluids engineering effects a very broad spectrum of the industry and life in general. Advances in this field enabled by the conference may help improve and optimize a large number of applications that benefit the entire society in general. Some examples of applications to be discussed at TFEC include wind turbines, fuel cells, industrial processes, biomedicine, etc. Full papers and extended abstracts for TFEC are published by Begell House in the form of a conference proceeding. This set of papers are compiled and made available on the Begell House website. This will result in broad dissemination of research results presented at the conference. Given that the conference is being held in New Orleans, keynote presentations and other activities will be organized to introduce the audience to local issues of relevance to thermal/fluids engineering, such as water management of river, flood, and hurricane-induced wave interactions between ocean, bayous, canals, lakes, and waterways. Furthermore, the thermal-fluid science and engineering community will be introduced to the success stories of various local entrepreneurial efforts in bio-science/engineering in New Orleans area. By striving to ensure significant representation of minorities and women among the travel grant beneficiaries, the conference organizers will ensure that minorities and women specifically benefit from the conference. Specific efforts will be made to publicize the travel grant opportunity among women and persons from traditionally under-represented groups and increase their participation in the conference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2002621,,,,,,,,University of Texas at Arlington,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15130463,,

The laver farming technologies studied in this study were limited to the technologies used in the process of culturing in the sea excluding the technologies used in the process of processing. The study is summarized as follows.First, laver farming in Korea began in the middle of the 17th century in the Gwangyang region in Jeonnam with ilbonhong (one rod laver bed) fascine culturing and laver farming in Japan began at the end of the 17th century, approximately 50 years later than Korea, in Tokyo Bay with ilbonhong fascine laver bed culturing.Second, with regard to the process of development of laver farming technologies in Korea by the time of restoration of national independence, in around 1850, fisherman Jeong Si-Won developed yeomhong (raft laver beds) made by weaving bamboos for the first time and at the end of 1920, Ganekko, the head of Jeollanam-do Fisheries Experimental Station improved the yeomhong into buhong (floating laver beds).In particular, in 1932, senalyeomhong (seumbal) was developed by fisherman Oh Byeong-Seok. The seumbal were widely spread as this technology solved problems in the previous buhong culturing technology to enable laver farming even in laver farms with strong winds and high waves.Third, with regard to the process of transition of laver farming technologies in Japan until the end of the war(1945), the laver farming technologies in the colonial Chosun such as the bamboo yeomhong (ttebal), horizontal raft buhong (jinebal: centipede laver beds), senal type yeomhong(seumbal) were not transferred to Japan and the laver farming technologies in Japan remained at the low technology level of only ilbonhong culturing at the bottom. At the end of the 1920s, fixed horizontal laver farming at the bottom using straw rope nets, palm leaf nets, hemp palm leaf nets, and cotton yarns was tested many times but theses tests could not be given any particular meaning as the results were not linked to the industry.Fourth, laver farming technologies in Korea hardly changed between 1945 and the end of 1960. However, the lengths of laver beds increased from 6∼8m in 1945 to 8∼11m by the end of the 1960s so that the laver farms were expanded to open ocean.Fifth, with regard to the development of laver farming technologies in Japan after the end of the war(1945), in the middle of the 1950s, along with artificial seedling collection, test culturing with palm net laver beds was successfully conducted and in 1958, floating lever bed culturing and pillar type laver bed culturing using the net laver beds were developed together. Thereafter, as innovative new farming technologies were introduced thanks to the development of artificial seedling collection, vessel FRP, outboard mechanization, collectors, and glassware dryers along with the development of chemical fiber net laver beds, a base for the development of laver farming technologies was constructed.Based on the results of this study, when the laver farming technologies in Korea and Japan were compared separately by age, it was newly found out that whereas laver farming in Korea began in the middle of the 17th century with ilbonhong fascine laver bed culturing and the pillar type jukhong(yeomhong) culturing technology developed in the 19th century (middle) was developed and upgraded into yeomhong, buhong, and senal yeomhong (seumbal) during the Japanese colonial era, the laver farming technologies in Japan were static and did not get out of the category of ilbonhong fascine laver bed culturing. After the time of restoration of independence of Korea to the 1960s, the base of laver farming was formed centering on net laver beds that introduced the artificial seedling collection technology in Japan. However, the laver farming technology in Japan could never be said to have been advanced compared to that in Korea at least by that time. This author wishes to point out that correct perception of laver farming technologies in Korea and Japan is necessary.",,,,"이 논문은 현재 활력이 떨어진 어촌사회의 구심점인 어촌계의 활성화를 위한 발전방향을 제시하고자 한 것이다. 이를 위해 우선 어촌계가 직면하고 있는 문제점을 어업인과 전문가를 대상으로 면담을 통해 발굴하였다. 이들 문제점에 대해 어업인들은 어떻게 인식하고 해결방향은 무엇인지를 알아보기 위해 어촌계 설문조사를 실시했고, 마지막으로 어촌계 설문조사 결과를 토대로 시사점을 정리하면서 어촌계 발전방향을 제시하였다.어촌계는 지구별수협의 조합원이 참여하여 행정구역･경제권 등을 중심으로 조직한다. 2015년 기준으로 어촌계는 전국 연안에 2,018개가 산재하고 있는데, 지역별로는 전남 848개소, 경남 464개소로 전체의 65%를 차지하고 있다. 이들 어촌계는 마을어업, 협동양식어업 등의 어업권을 이용하고 있다.현재 어촌계가 직면하고 있는 문제점은 인력 감소 및 고령화 진전, 귀어인 등 신규인력에 대한 진입장벽, 어업권 어장의 이용․관리 부실, 신규 사업의 재원 및 운영능력 부족, 어촌계 지도․감독 기능 미 작동, 회계결산 및 어촌계장 선출을 둘러싼 내부 갈등 존재 등으로 정리할 수 있다. 이러한 어촌계의 당면문제들에 대해 어촌계들은 어떻게 인식하는지 파악하고, 어촌계 발전방향을 도출하기 위해 전국 401개소 어촌계를 대상으로 설문조사를 실시하였다. 어촌계 설문조사는 어촌계 주 업종 및 어촌계원 연령, 어업권의 종류 및 이용 실태 등의 일반내용, 귀어･귀촌인에 대한 인식 및 신규가입 희망 시 절차와 귀어․귀촌인 등 새로운 인력의 어촌계 유입 필요성, 신규인력 유입에 대한 수용 및 미수용 태도 등을 내용으로 하였다. 어촌계 설문조사 결과를 정리하면, 고령화 문제와 진입장벽 등이 공통적으로 존재하지만, 대부분 어촌계에서는 어촌 활성화를 위해 신규인력 유입, 새로운 형태의 공동체로 개편 등이 필요하다는 것을 인식하고 있었다.향후 어촌계가 활력을 되찾아 어촌지역의 구심점이 되기 위해서는 배타성과 폐쇄성에서 벗어나 개방과 협력이 전제된 공동체로 재편이 필요하다. 이를 위해서는 우선 새로운 인력을 유입하기 위해 어촌계 가입자격을 조합원에서 귀어업인 등으로 확대하여 어촌계 구역에 거주하는 어업인이 가입할 수 있도록 제도 개편이 따라야 한다. 다음으로 어촌계 운영의 투명성 제고하기 위한 어촌계 정관 및 규약, 결산보고 등을 공개해 나간다. 또한 시･군･구 및 지구별수협에서 어촌계 역량 제고 및 지도･감독의 강화가 필요하다. 마지막으로 어촌계 사업수행 능력과 경영 마인드를 제고하기 위해서 지역 밀착형 지원조직((가칭)어촌공동체 활성화 위원회)을 구성하여 어촌계 경영진단, 영어계획 수립, 신규 사업 발굴, 경영 컨설팅 등을 실시해 갈 필요가 있다.",,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1738-1592,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-01-01,KJD:ART002255733,,

The project will acquire new ultra-high-resolution 3D seismic data cubes across small areas around three different active methane venting systems along the Oregon margin. Recent ODP drilling on Hydrate Ridge during Leg 204 discovered a dynamic gas vent system in which free gas either migrates along fast direct routes through continuous vertical fractures or through more tortuous routes through permeable horizontal stratigraphic turbidite sands and vertical fractures. It is fundamentally unclear how gas migrates through the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) to the seafloor at Hydrate Ridge, and, in particular, whether fluid flow is constrained primarily by structure or stratigraphy. Furthermore, gas venting at the seafloor in hydrate regions is common but enigmatic. To reach the seafloor vents, free gas must migrate through the GHSZ, yet free gas in the GHSZ should be unstable, form hydrate and become immobile. The structures, mechanisms, and temporal evolution of these enigmatic gas vent systems, such as Hydrate Ridge and elsewhere, are poorly known. A recent 3D seismic reflection survey and drilling during Leg 204 revealed a major free gas conduit leading to the summit of southern Hydrate Ridge. A turbidite horizon, Horizon A, provides a conduit for free gas at the southern summit 40 m beneath the base of the GHSZ and 150 m below seafloor (mbsf). The existing 3D seismic reflection data reveal details about the geometry and reflection properties of Horizon A, yet they reveal very little about free gas migration in the most intriguing interval, from Horizon A through the GHSZ to the seafloor. Leg 204 results reveal that the limited resolution of current seismic data (~ 5 m) is clearly inadequate for imaging hydrate layers (which are ~ 1-2 m thick) or detecting small-scale faults that may hydraulically connect the primary gas source at Horizon A to the seafloor. The proponents will apply a novel and low-cost ultra-high resolution 3D seismic imaging technique that will provide two additional higher scales of resolution and produced dramatic images of fluid conduits at the Oregon margin vents. Specifically, they will collect two 3D seismic datasets at each of three sites; southern Hydrate Ridge, northern Hydrate Ridge, and SE Knolls. The two surveys, which will utilize high frequency air-gun and chirp sources, will provide the best possible images of shallow vent conduits, stratigraphic conduits, small-scale faults, hydrate layers, and anomalous reflectivity due to free gas and hydrate accumulations beneath the vents. These data will reveal new details about the spatial and possibly temporal evolution of vent conduits, and provide critical details for planning, siting, and interpreting the results of potential IODP drilling (625-Full), which plans to install CORKs to measure and monitor vent properties in situ at southern Hydrate Ridge. Broader impacts. The work will build on the existing ODP Legs 146 and 204 drilling efforts to investigate Hydrate Ridge and to complement IODP follow-up drilling (625-Full). The drilling is designed to install CORKs at multiple sites and investigate temporal and spatial variability in a venting system that feeds methane up through the GHSZ to the summit of southern Hydrate Ridge and into the local seafloor chemosynthetic communities. This work will directly support the broad goals of understanding methane hydrate systems as outlined in the IODP Initial Science Plan (methane is both a greenhouse gas and a large potential energy resource), and provide a broader context for siting and interpreting the results of the future drilling and CORKing. The work will foster collaboration with the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK, and promote the implementation and development of a low-cost high-resolution 3D seismic acquisition facility, as a complement to deeper penetration 3D seismic facilities on the R/V Langseth.

There are a variety of waxes combined in a single lipstick to provide good stability, pleasant texture and good pay-off. Due to a significant growth for natural, green and sustainable products, there is a constant search for alternatives to animal-derived and petroleum-derived ingredients. In this study, a green, non-animalderived wax, namely long-chain ketones (referred to as alkenones), sourced from marine microalgae was formulated into lipsticks and evaluated as a structuring agent. METHODS Alkenones were used as a substitute for microcrystalline wax, ozokerite and candelilla wax, typical structuring agents. In total, 384 lipsticks were formulated: L1 (control, no alkenones), L2 (alkenones as a substitute for ozokerite), L3 (alkenones as a substitute for microcrystalline wax) and L4 (alkenones as a substitute for candelilla wax). Products were tested for hardness (bending force), stiffness, firmness (needle penetration), pay-off (using a texture analyser and a consumer panel), friction, melting point and stability for 12 weeks at 25 and 45 degrees C. RESULTS Alkenones influenced each characteristic evaluated. In general, lipsticks with alkenones (L2-L4) became softer and easier to bend compared to the control (L1). In terms of firmness, lipsticks were similar to the control, except for L4, which was significantly (P < 0.05) firmer. The effect on pay-off was not consistent. L2 and L3 had higher pay-off to skin and fabric than L1. In addition, L4 had the lowest amount transferred, but it still had the highest colour intensity on skin. Alkenones influenced friction (glide) positively; the average friction decreased for L2-L4. The lowest friction (i.e. best glide) was shown in L4. Melting point of the lipsticks was lower when alkenones were present. Overall, L4, containing 7% of 4 alkenones in combination with microcrystalline wax, ozokerite and carnauba wax, was found to have the most desirable attributes, including ease of bending, high level of firmness, low pay-off in terms of amount, high colour intensity on skin and low friction (i.e. better glide). Consumers preferred L4 the most overall. CONCLUSION Results of this study indicate that alkenones offer a sustainable, non-animal and non-petroleum-derived choice as a structuring agent for lipsticks.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,6,0,10,,,0142-5463,1468-2494,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Toledo, Coll Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharm Practice, Toledo, OH 43614 USAWoods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USAWestern Washington Univ, Dept Chem, Bellingham, WA 98225 USAACT Solut Corp, Newark, DE USA",ACT Solut Corp,,,2020-02-10,WOS:000510329000001,31880361,

If these CH4 hydrates could be converted into CO2 hydrates, they would serve double duty as CH4 sources and CO2 storage sites. We explore here the swapping phenomenon occurring in structure l (sl) and structure II (sil) CH4 hydrate deposits through spectroscopic analyses and its potential application to CO2 sequestration at the preliminary phase. The present 85% CH4 recovery rate in sl CH4 hydrate achieved by the direct use of binary N-2 + CO2 guests is surprising when compared with the rate of 64% for a pure CO2 guest attained in the previous approach. The direct use of a mixture of N-2 + CO2 eliminates the requirement of a CO2 separation/purification process. in addition, the simultaneously occurring dual mechanism of CO2 sequestration and CH4 recovery is expected to provide the physicochemical background required for developing a promising large-scale approach with economic feasibility. In the case of sill CH4 hydrates, we observe a spontaneous structure transition of sll to sl during the replacement and a cage-specific distribution of guest molecules. A significant change of the lattice dimension caused by structure transformation induces a relative number of small cage sites to reduce, resulting in the considerable increase of CH4 recovery rate. The mutually interactive pattern of targeted guest-cage conjugates possesses important implications for the diverse hydrate-based inclusion phenomena as illustrated in the swapping process between CO2 stream and complex CH4 hydrate structure.",,,,,,,,,387,13,0,0,40,0,420,,,0027-8424,,,,,,,,,,,"Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Taejon 305701, South KoreaKongju Natl Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Chungnam 330717, South KoreaKorea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources, Taejon 305350, South Korea",,,,2006-08-22,WOS:000240035900010,16908854,

All participants, regardless of active participation in follow up interviews or exam, are followed over time via linkage to cancer and mortality records.The first cohort-wide (except for Vietnamese-speaking participants) follow-up interview was completed in May 2016. The interview assessed changes in health status and factors that could confound associations between exposures and outcomes. A second follow-up interview cycle began in 2018. In addition to updating previously collected questionnaire data, the new interview adds questions about fertility and reproductive health. There are also new questions on sleep, metabolic health, and social factors to enable studies of health disparities. As part of this interview, we validate self-reported health endpoints through questions on medications or treatments that support the diagnosis (e.g. use of insulin or oral agents by diabetics), and request medical record release authorization for selected conditions. A unique aspect of this work is the extensive characterization of oil spill exposures. We used questionnaires and measurement data to develop an ordinal job-exposure matrix (JEM) for airborne THC as a composite marker for oil spill exposures. We also developed ordinal measures for exposure to dispersants and particulates from burning oil using questionnaires and external information we gathered about OSRC activities and requirements. We used questionnaire data to identify groups of jobs/tasks with likely similar exposures and used the measurement data from monitoring that took place during the clean-up to characterize the exposures in those jobs. Exposures were found to vary by location, task, and time in relation to the capping of the well, among other factors. Methods were developed and/or evaluated to identify the least biased way to deal with values below the LOD and other censoring. New quantitative measures have recently been developed. These measures incorporate time spent in various jobs/tasks and additional information from measurements made during the spill and industry and government documentation of cleanup activities. Ongoing analysis of baseline and follow-up data continues to be focused on mental health, pulmonary function, cardiovascular outcomes, respiratory health, neurologic symptoms, and a range of specific and non-specific symptoms reported by participants while working on the response and clean-up. A recent analysis showed that mental health symptoms were increased with increasing number of disaster experiences, with greater levels of depression and PTSD-like symptoms among persons who experienced both disruption due to Hurricane Katrina and worked on oil spill clean-up (Lowe et al. 2019).Pulmonary function testing was done during the GuLF STUDY home exams. Workers who handled oily wildlife (plants, birds, dead animal) had significantly reduced lung function (Gam et al., 2018) compared to a nationally representative sample. A current analysis is considering changes in lung function over time since the clean-up.Several analyses considered risk of MI in relation to various oil spill exposures. Risk for incident nonfatal MI was suggestively increased among those who cleaned up after the oil spill (Strelitz et al., 2018). Total MI fatal and nonfatal MI over 5 years of follow-up was also shown to be associated with higher levels of exposure to hydrocarbons (Strelitz et al. 2019). Ongoing and future work will evaluate associations with chemical-specific quantitative exposure measures and consider changes in symptoms and clinical measures over timeDetails of the development of an ordinal exposure measurement algorithm were published (Stewart et al., 2018). Other measures were recently completed included quantitative, time-dependent metrics for total hydrocarbons and specific oil spill chemicals, PM2.5 from burning. Methods to characterize dermal exposure was also published (Gorman et al. 2019). Although not an oil spill chemical, per se, blood levels of styrene had been found to be higher among Gulf coast residents participating in this study compared to levels from a U.S. population sample (NHANES). Styrene, at occupational exposure levels, is a neurotoxin. We investigated the potential link between population level styrene exposures and neurological symptoms and function. Two exposure measures were used blood levels of styrene, and ambient exposures as estimated using an EPA national air toxics database linked to the residences of GuLF STUDY participants. Styrene was suggestively associated with both symptoms and several specific tests of neurological function (Werder et al., 2018; Werder et al. 2019). Other recent papers from the study describe predictors of current levels of blood volatile organic compounds (Werder et al. 2018), and symptoms associated with potential exposure to dispersants, and changes in hematologic measures associated with BTEX exposures. Ongoing and future work will evaluate associations with chemical-specific quantitative exposure measures and consider changes in symptoms and clinical measures over time. Analysis of biospecimens is underway with measurements of kidney and liver bioassays in relation to chemical exposures. An epigenome wide study of methylation in blood and a genome-wide association study are being carried out in a sample of participants selected based on total hydrocarbon and burning exposure levels as well specific health outcomes, for studies of epigenetic effects of chemical exposures and the influence of epigenetic and genetic factors on specific health outcomes such as pulmonary function.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,10008730; 1ZIAES102945-10; ZIAES102945,,,,,,,,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES,,,,2023-12-14,GRANTS:14973442,,

There are two main limiting factors in current practice during cable installation of an S-lay configuration: the design criterion for the minimum allowable radius of curvature in the touch down point and the avoidance of axial compression in the touch down zone. Accurate assessment of the cable integrity during offshore installation has drawn great attention and is related to the existing available analysis and design tools. The main purpose of this paper is to develop and propose a quick and easy custom-made analysis tool, which is able to export similar results as sophisticated finite element analysis software. The developed tool utilizes analytical equations of a catenary-type submarine structure extended to account for varying cross-sections with different weights and/or stiffnesses, as is the real practice. A comparative study is presented in this paper to evaluate the significance for the modeling of the out of water cable segment required for accurate safety factor quantification during a laying operation. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed tool are proven through a validation study comparing the results and the computational effort and time with commercial finite element analysis software. The analysis error in the case of not modeling the out of water cable part is significant, especially in shallow water areas, which proves the importance of using the proposed analysis tool.",,,,,,,,,4,1,0,0,0,0,5,,,,2077-1312,,,,,,,,,,"Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn & Geomat, CY-3036 Limassol, CyprusCDC Construct Co, Athens 75752, TX, GreeceNatl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Mech, GR-15773 Athens, Greece",CDC Construct Co,,,2020-03-02,WOS:000513656700029,,

J,,,,,,,,,Thomas Andritsch,,Enhanced Electrical and Thermal Rating Power Cables for Renewables Connections in Developing Countries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 01 2017,2017,"The world faces a major challenge, namely, how to supply energy to a growing population reliably, economically and without causing severe environmental damage. Looking forward, it is inevitable that our reliance on electricity will increase, as transport and heating become increasingly electrified, and that this increase will be largely met by renewable sources. Such facilities will be constructed at locations where prevailing conditions are appropriate and, in the UK, an example relates to plans to develop major offshore wind resources in the North Sea. However, the construction of large offshore facilities and the transmission of the resulting electricity back to shore is still very expensive and, therefore, it is imperative that this is done efficiently.All electrical plant relies upon electrical insulation and, today, this is primarily based upon polymers. While these materials are excellent electrical insulators, they are also poor conductors of heat, such that heat dissipation is a major issue. There would therefore be massive technological, environmental and societal benefits from the availability of commercially viable material systems that were excellent electrical insulators and good thermal conductors. Although it is intuitively appealing to think that thermal conductivity can be increased by adding a good thermal conductor to a thermally insulating material, this is not generally true, because the resulting boundaries give rise to phonon scattering which, effectively, offsets the anticipated gains. While this can be overcome if the thermally conducting additives form percolating paths through the material, the consequences of this have inevitably been an unacceptable reduction in the electrical breakdown strength of the material. However, recent results obtained at the University of Southampton appear to overthrow this paradigm. Specifically, a 20% INCREASE in breakdown strength has been accompanied by a 60% INCREASE in thermal conductivity in a system based upon hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) dispersed in a polyethylene matrix. Since these preliminary results were obtained from a totally non-optimised system, we believe that further improvements in both technical performance and economic attractiveness (i.e. reduced cost from adding less h-BN) are attainable.The results of our preliminary work are contrary to accepted understanding, so the PROJECT AIM is to determine how simultaneous improvement can be optimised for use in two key materials that are particularly relevant to power cable applications. The key challenges are: to understand how to optimse the exfoliation of h-BN particles into their constituent layers and, subsequently, to disperse them within the matrix, such that the required combination of electrical and thermal characteristics result; to ensure scale-ability, such that laboratory results are technologically viable. In this project, we will consider two matrix systems, due to their technological relevance. First, we will examine crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE), since this is currently the most important cable insulation material. The work programme will progressively build from improving solvent dispersion, polymer blending methods and surface functionalisation, to scale-up with masterbatch production through combined solution and melt-process methods. Characterisation of the microstructure and dielectric testing will ensure consistent dispersion and distribution of the hBN filler, as well as optimal electrical properties. In this way, quantitative structure-property-process relationships will be established that will enable the resulting material systems to be used reliably in the electrical cable industry. While the focus of this project is on electrical properties, the knowledge about structure-property-process relationships will affect much wider technology areas, which employ advanced materials for improved mechanical or thermal properties.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/P030912/1,,,,,,,,University of Southampton,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15347961,,
J,,,,,,,,,"SANDLER, DALE P",,Gulf Longitudinal Follow-up (GuLF) Study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 1800,1800,"The Gulf Long-term Follow-up Study (GuLF STUDY, www.gulfstudy.nih.gov) was initiated in response to the April 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) drilling rig and resulting oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest marine oil spill in U.S. history. A total of 32,608 oil spill response and clean-up workers completed a telephone enrollment questionnaire between 2011-2013. Over 11,000 participants from Gulf states completed a home visit that included collection of biospecimens and collection of anthropometric and lung function measurements. A subset of 2,969 participants completed repeated questionnaires to assess mental health trajectories over 4 visits between 2013-2016. A subset of 3,403 participants completed a clinical exam (2014-2016) that included additional lung function measurement, assessment of neurological function, and biological sample collection. Participants are followed over time via linkage to cancer and mortality records.Follow-up data were collected for 21,256 participants between 2013-2016. A second follow-up interview cycle began in 2018 and is nearing completion. In addition to updating previously collected questionnaire data, the new interview adds questions about fertility and reproductive health. There are also new questions on sleep, metabolic health, and social factors to enable studies of health disparities. As part of this interview, we are attempting to validate self-reported health endpoints by collecting data on medications or treatments that support the diagnosis (e.g. use of insulin or oral agents by diabetics) and requesting medical records. A unique aspect of this work is the extensive characterization of oil spill exposures. We used questionnaires and measurement data to develop an ordinal job-exposure matrix (JEM) for total hydrocarbons (THC) as a composite marker of oil spill exposures.

Exposures were found to vary by location, task, and time in relation to the capping of the well, among other factors. Statistical methods were developed and/or evaluated to identify the least biased way to deal with values below the LOD and other censoring. Recently published or in press papers describe newer metrics for characterizing dermal exposures to oil and oil related products (Gorman et al, 2019); inhalation exposures to six oil-related compounds on the four rig vessels that responded to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (Huynh , et al., in press); and particulate matter exposure from the in situ burning of oil and gas (Pratt et al., in press). A paper describing a new quantitative job-exposure matrix to characterize time-weighted and cumulated exposures to total hydrocarbons and individual BTEX chemicals is being finalized as are papers that detail the statistical methods underpinning this work. Some of these new measures are already being evaluated in relation to specific health effects. Short- and long-term mental health effects continue to be a concern. A recent analysis showed that mental health symptoms were increased with increasing number of disaster experiences, with greater levels of depression and PTSD-like symptoms among persons who experienced both disruption due to Hurricane Katrina and worked on oil spill clean-up (Lowe et al. 2019). Current analyses are evaluating the persistence of mental health symptoms such as depression and anxiety as well as the association between oil spill exposures and various patterns of mental health trajectories. We recently developed indices of cumulative disaster burden for the cohort and have submitted a paper that describes the impact of experiencing multiple weather-related disasters and losses on mental health in the cohort.Pulmonary function testing was done at the GuLF STUDY home exams and again, for a subset, during a clinical exam 2 years later. A recently published paper showed that while workers with the highest levels of exposure to oil spill chemicals had reduced lung function at the time of the home visit (1-3 years after the spill), these deficits were no long apparent at the clinical exam (4-6 years after the spill (Lawrence, et al., 2020). We studied risk of cardiovascular disease over five-years of follow-up in relation to levels of exposure to total hydrocarbons and found a significant increase in risk (Hazard Ratio = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.95), equaling 10 excess cases per 1,000 workers for incident heart attack at the highest versus lowest level of exposure (Strelitz et al., 2019a). We also reported that living in proximity to the oil spill (versus living further away) and duration of oil spill cleanup work were associated with increased risk of incident self-reported and fatal MI (Strelitz et al., 2019b). These associations will be explored in greater detail in a proposed doctoral dissertation with will consider newer exposure metrics and longer cohort follow-up.Although not an oil spill chemical, per se, blood levels of styrene had been found to be higher among Gulf coast residents participating in this study compared to levels from a U.S. population sample. Styrene, at occupational exposure levels, is a neurotoxin. We investigated the potential link between population-level styrene exposures and neurological symptoms and function. Two exposure measures were used: blood levels of styrene, and ambient exposures estimated using an EPA national air toxics database linked to the residences of GuLF STUDY participants. Styrene was suggestively associated with both symptoms and several specific tests of neurological function (Werder et al., 2018; Werder et al. 2019a). A related paper sought to identify determinants of environmental styrene exposer in Gulf State residents (Werder et al., 2019b). We also considered contemporaneous exposure to metals in relation neurologic symptoms, finding that associations with blood levels of metals and neurological symptoms were modified by selenium. Blood levels of BTEX chemicals were also associated with the reporting of neurological symptoms. These exposures reflected current exposures rather than exposures from the oil spill given the short half lives of these chemicals (Werder et al., 2019c). We also reported suggestive evidence of associations of blood BTEXS and heavy metals with selected biomarkers of liver injury and systemic inflammation (Werder et al, 2020). A new line of work considers the impact of socioeconomic disadvantage in relation to various health outcomes in this cohort. We recently reported that neighborhood disadvantage, as measured by the Area Deprivation Index was associated with increased obesity and diabetes risk both cross-sectionally and longitudinally (Hu et al., 2020 in press). Additional analyses of biomarkers of kidney and liver dysfunction in relation to oil spill exposures are underway. An epigenome wide study of methylation in blood is being carried out in a sample of participants selected based on total hydrocarbon and burning exposure levels. Laboratory work is complete as is preprocessing and cleaning of the data. This work is designed to identify a potential epigenetic signature for oil-spill exposures and to determine if oil spill exposures are associated with epigenetic-based measures of age acceleration (epigenetic clocks) as well as specific health outcomes such as reduced lung function.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,10252592; 1ZIAES102945-11; ZIAES102945,,,,,,,,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES,,,,2023-12-14,GRANTS:15558207,,

A fast-pressurized liquid extraction method with ethyl acetate as green solvent is used to produce camelina oil with a 39.3% yield in less than 20min. In a first stage, camelina oil with a 29.7% of ALA is used to enzymatically produce 2-monoacylglycerols (2-MAGs) with high ALA composition in position sn-2 (49.8% of ALA) using Lipozyme TL IM at 25 degrees C. For omega-3 incorporation into STAGs, several lipases are studied, with 2-MAG and omega-3 FAEEs at different ratios (1:5, 1:10, and 1:20 (w/w)), 10% (w/w) of biocatalyst at 35 degrees C. STAGs yields reached with EPA ethyl esters are notably higher than using DHA-EE. Lipase from Candida antarctica B (CAL-B) and Thermomyces lanuginosus (TLL) incorporate EPA into STAGs in the same degree, 95.1 and 95.5%, respectively. However, for enriched DHA STAGs, maximum reaction yield is reached with CAL-B (81.0%). The transesterification method of 2-MAGs from vegetable omega-3 sources like camelina oil, with marine EPA and DHA FAEEs, opens new approaches for developing VLC-PUFA fortified functional foods.Practical Applications: Results provided in this research not only demonstrate the efficiency of this enzymatic method for enriching camelina oil in EPA and DHA, but offer a very effective strategy for the development of omega-3-enriched products from other vegetable oil sources like chia or echium as ingredients for functional foods with recognized health claims for applications in nutraceutical and food industries. Camelina oil proved to be an excellent source to enzymatically produce 2-MAGs enriched in omega-3 ALA. Moreover, lipase screening with commercial biocatalysts establish the most appropriate strategy to reach maximum STAGs yields with direct application in industry. Tested lipases exhibit different degree of substrate specificity toward EPA and DHA, omega-3 acids not present in natural seed oils. Thus, CAL-B seems to be the most suitable lipase to produce high content EPA and DHA enriched STAGs from camelina oil as new food ingredients for nutraceutical applications.

The objective of this project is to educate students and advance research in water waves and fluid-structure interactions (FSI) in relation to the analysis and design of LCES. In particular, the aim is to advance computational modeling of breaking water waves and high Reynolds number (Re) flows because model-scale tests used in today.s design cannot reproduce full-scale structural behavior. Due to this fact, the most common vibrations problems on LCES are those induced by vortex shedding, that is, both wind flow and wave/current loads. Although previous investigations have been done, unresolved issues remain to be investigated of the interactions of density stratified multiphase fluids and fluid-solid mechanisms. This is especially true when the free-surface becomes unstable and breaks and for fluid structure mechanisms with high Re. This project is concerned with these interactions as they could be responsible for loss of structural integrity and even failure. To this end, numerical models can prove to be valuable tools in analyzing and understanding the mechanisms of free surface instabilities and FSI. However any method that can provide aid should be used, including, theoretical, experimental and/or computational methods. But computational model development is prioritized mainly because it is believed that new discoveries can be made in free-surface instabilities and high Re incompressible flows around bluff-bodies. Intellectual merits: A principal challenge to be addressed is that of moving interfaces, as well as the multitude of scales in the flow. The project is concerned with investigations of breaking water waves and vortex induced resonance problems of LCES. This project is driven by the following core ideas: 1) Extending the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) equation to model breaking ocean waves numerically; 2) Numerically predicting vortex induced resonance on LCES using an extended LB formulation; 3) Developing an interdisciplinary FSI course. Civil engineering students will especially benefit; 4) Using a virtual reality laboratory in teaching and research. The LB approach, which is based on statistical mechanic concepts, obeys Navier-Stokes equations. It has been used extensively in molecular dynamics and physics but has not been developed in relation to LCES. To the PI.s knowledge, this is the first time a LB model is being developed to simulate breaking ocean waves and their interactions with LCES. It is also the first time a LB formulation contains FSI, turbulence and nonlinear free-surface model capabilities. The fundamentals of the model approach have several attractive features, especially with regard to free- surface breaking waves, FSI and parallel solver development. The unsteady flows of interest are highly three-dimensional and are further complicated by the interaction with a fixed or oscillating structure. Therefore, to improve the learning process for students and researchers at all levels, emphasis on visualization programming in a virtual reality laboratory to analyze the results of the models is proposed.

Free-surface physical experiments are planned and will mainly comprise monitoring sloshing motion in tanks. The bluff-body aerodynamics experiments will focus on simultaneous measurements of structural movement and the wind field.

Several field results on submarine power cable faults are provided.For land cables the main focus is on the electrical and thermal design of cable insulation and on the electro-thermal and thermo-mechanical design of cable accessories, in order to grant sufficient endurance performances and reliability to the whole cable systems (Mazzanti, G., Marzinotto, M., Extruded cables for high-voltage direct current transmission: advances in research and development. New York, Wiley-Blackwell, 2013). In submarine cables more issues arise, some related to the harsh laying environment, some others-even more troublesome-associated with man-made activities. Indeed, on the one hand submarine power cables are subject to strong mechanical stresses during the laying operations and critical service conditions in their working ambience. On the other hand, submarine cables are continuously exposed in all water depth to random mechanical damages caused by fishing gears, anchors and natural hazards (Bawart, M., Marzinotto, M., in Insulated Conductors Committee ICC/IEEE-PES, C11D submarine cables, St. Peters-burg, FL, November, 2012; CIGRE, Third-party damage to underground and submarine cables, Brochure 398, WG B1.21, December, 2009).The longer the expected life and the longer the path of the submarine cable link, the higher is the probability of facing one or more faults due to human activities. Based on surveys about submarine cable failure data recorded worldwide over long periods, it can be concluded that the probability of experiencing at least one fault during lifetime is close to certainty for long submarine links. Statistically most damages to submarine cables are caused by human activities; only a low percentage is caused by natural hazards.Based on growing energy demand and dependency on offshore produced renewable energy, submarine power cables become essential for reliable electric power supply and often can be classified as critical infrastructure (International Cable Protection Committee-ICPC, About submarine power cables, 2011, www.iscpc.org).Repair of damaged submarine power cables requires specialized ships as well as experts to recover the cable from the sea bed and replace the faulty cable section. Another critical aspect associated with long submarine cables is that, whenever a fault occurs, a fairly long time is spent for repair. For this reason, fast and efficient fault detection is essential in order to reduce the overall outage time as much as possible.All these aspects are discussed in this paper. The best practice commonly employed for classifying submarine power cable fault types are included in the paper, together with the results of measurements carried out in the field.The paper points out that fault location on submarine power cables differs by much from classical cable fault location on buried land cables as to both conditions and measuring methods, thereby illustrating the most efficient cable fault location methods. Some field results on submarine power cable faults are provided, measured on AC submarine cables as well as on HVDC submarine links.A unique case study of fault location on longest HVDC Submarine Link will illustrate TDR based measurements on cable lengths above 400 km. The case studies further focus on TDR diagram analysis in order to explain how to identify cable joints.The results prove that the overall outage time for repair activities can drop significantly if the fault location system is peculiarly designed for detecting faults in very long submarine cables with a good measuring accuracy.The hazards for operators and instruments connected to the huge amount of electrical energy that may be stored in very long links are also tackled in the paper, thereby addressing the particular safety issues involved by extra-long submarine cables.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,0932-383X,1613-7620,,,,,,,,,,"BAUR Pruf & Messtech GmbH, Raiffeisenstr 8, A-6832 Sulz, AustriaUniv Bologna, Bologna, Italy",BAUR Pruf & Messtech GmbH,,,2014-12-01,WOS:000218261400018,,
