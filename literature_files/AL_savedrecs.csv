Drawing on the results of the research program Zukunft Kuste - Coastal Futures, this contribution considers the resilience of the social-ecological system to the introduction of offshore wind farming in a northern German case study region. We do so by focusing on regime shifts and cross-scale effects, described through the concepts of adaptive cycles and ecosystem services. Offshore wind farming is shown to lead to a potential slow regime shift in the marine ecosystem, as well as a more rapid regime shift in the seascape. These shifts lead to changes in the available ecosystem services and conflicts between new and traditional sea and seascape values. We then explore the impact of these changes on the socioeconomic system on the coast. Against the background of the system's current state and constraints, we argue this impact could be creative and innovative, but this trajectory depends on an internal socio-political shift and willingness to change.",,,,,,,,,16,1,0,0,8,0,18,,,1708-3087,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecol Ctr Kiel, Kiel, GermanyHelmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Utrecht, Netherlands",Ecol Ctr KielHelmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht,,,2013-02-20,WOS:000313417400041,,

This paper will review accomplishments and challenges, citing some of the key research findings and publications that have resulted from the experiments in Biosphere 2. Engineering accomplishments included development of a technique for variable volume to deal with pressure differences between the facility and outside environment, developing methods of atmospheric leak detection and sealing, while achieving new standards of closure, with an annual atmospheric leakrate of less than 10%, or less than 300 ppm per day. This degree of closure permitted detailed tracking of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and trace gases such as nitrous oxide and ethylene over the seasonal variability of two years. Full closure also necessitated developing new approaches and technologies for complete air, water, and wastewater recycle and reuse within the facility. The development of a soil-based highly productive agricultural system was a first in closed ecological systems, and much was learned about managing a wide variety of crops using non-chemical means of pest and disease control. Closed ecological systems have different temporal biogeochemical cycling and ranges of atmospheric components because of their smaller reservoirs of air, water and soil, and higher concentration of biomass, and Biosphere 2 provided detailed examination and modeling of these accelerated cycles over a period of closure which measured in years. Medical research inside Biosphere 2 included the effects on humans of lowered oxygen: the discovery that human productivity can be maintained with good health with lowered atmospheric oxygen levels could lead to major economies on the design of space stations and planetary/lunar settlements. The improved health resulting from the calorie-restricted but nutrient dense Biosphere 2 diet was the first such scientifically controlled experiment with humans. The success of Biosphere 2 in creating a diversity of terrestrial and marine environments from rainforest to coral reef, allowed detailed studies with comprehensive measurements such that the dynamics of these complex biomic systems are now better understood. The coral reef ecosystem, the largest artificial reef ever built, catalyzed methods of study now being applied to planetary coral reef systems. Restoration ecology advanced through the creation and study of the dynamics of adaptation and self-organization of the biomes in Biosphere 2. The international interest that Biosphere 2 generated has given new impetus to the public recognition of the sciences of biospheres (biospherics), biomes and closed ecological life systems. The facility, although no longer a materially-closed ecological system, is being used as an educational facility by Columbia University as an introduction to the study of the biosphere and complex system ecology and for carbon dioxide impacts utilizing the complex ecosystems created in Biosphere 2. The many lessons learned from Biosphere 2 are being used by its key team of creators in their design and operation of a laboratory-sized closed ecological system, the Laboratory Biosphere, in operation as of March 2002, and for the design of a Mars on Earth(TM) prototype life support system for manned missions to Mars and Mars surface habitats.Biosphere 2 is an important foundation for future advances in biospherics and closed ecological system research.

Accordingly, analytical techniques continue to evolve that address these challenges to reveal the characteristics of ecological systems and inform conservation actions. We applied multiple statistical learning algorithms (i.e., machine learning) with a range of information sources including fish tracking data, environmental data, and visual surveys to identify potential spawning aggregation sites for a marine fish species, permit (Trachinotus falcatus), in the Florida Keys. Recognizing the potential complementarity and some level of uncertainty in each information source, we applied supervised (classic and conditional random forests; RF) and unsupervised (fuzzyk-means; FKM) algorithms. The two RF models had similar predictive performance, but generated different predictor variable importance structures and spawning site predictions. Unsupervised clustering using FKM identified unique site groupings that were similar to the likely spawning sites identified with RF. The conservation of aggregate spawning fish species depends heavily on the protection of key spawning sites; many of these potential sites were identified here for permit in the Florida Keys, which consisted of relatively deep-water natural and artificial reefs with high mean permit residency periods. The application of multiple machine learning algorithms enabled the integration of diverse information sources to develop models of an ecological system.

However, many SES models fail to integrate adequate information from both the human and ecological subsystems. With an example model of a future Offshore Wind Farm development and its effects on both the ecosystem and local human population, we illustrate a method facilitating a balanced SES model, in terms of including information from both subsystems. We use qualitative mathematical modeling, which allows to quickly analyze the structure and dynamics of a system without including quantitative data, and therefore to compare alternative system structures based on different understandings of how the system works. By including similar number of system variables in the two subsystems, we balanced the complexity between them. Our analyses show that this complexity is important in order to predict indirect and sometimes counterintuitive effects. We also highlight some conceptually important questions concerning social compensations during developmental projects in general, and wind farms in particular. Our results suggest that the more project holders get involved in various manner in the local socio-ecological system, the more society will benefit as a whole. Increased involvement through e.g. new projects or job-opportunities around the windfarm has the capacity to offset the negative effects of the windfarm on the local community. These benefits are enhanced when there is an overall acceptance and appropriation of the project. We suggest this method as a tool to support the decision-making process and to facilitate discussions between stakeholders, especially among local communities.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,9,0,17,,,0308-597X,1872-9460,,,,,,,,,,"Sorbonne Univ, Univ Caen Normandie, Univ Antilles,CNRS 7208,IRD 207,MNHN,EcoFunc, Res Unit BOREA Biol Aquat Organisms & Ecosyst,CNR, CS 14032, F-14000 Caen, FranceSorbonne Univ, Univ Caen Normandie, Univ Antilles,IRD 207,CNRS 7208, Res Unit BOREA Biol Aquat Organisms & Ecosyst,MNH, 43 Rue Cuvier,CP26, F-75005 Paris, FranceUniv Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, Box 461, SE-40530 Gothenburg, SwedenSorbonne Univ, Univ Paris Est Creteil, Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Ecol & Environm Sci Paris,CNRS,INRA,IRD, F-75005 Paris, FranceIUEM, Far View Conseil, LEMAR UMR 6539, Technopole Brest Iroise, F-29280 Plouzane, FranceUniv Brest, IUEM, AMURE, CNRS,Ifremer,UMR 6308, F-29280 Plouzane, FranceCSIRO, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia",,,,2020-09-15,WOS:000564689000018,,

The ecosystem services framework embraces this vision of nature through monetary valuation of the environment to correct market failures and government distortions that hinder efficient allocation of public goods, including goods and services provided by biodiversity and ecosystems. The popularity of this approach is reflected in different countries legislation; for instance, US, EU and UK have introduced economic criteria for comparing costs and benefits of environmental policies in protecting ecosystem services.From an operational perspective, the ecosystem services framework requires ecologists to estimate how the supply of services is affected by changes in the functionality and/or the extent of ecosystems; and economists to identify how changes in the supply affect the flow of direct and indirect benefits to people. However, this approach may be simplistic when faced with the complexity of social-ecological systems. We investigated this for three different marine services: assimilative capacity of waste, coastal defense and renewable energy. We find that economic valuation could provide efficient and fair allocations in the case of assimilative capacity, but leads to social clashes between outputs generated by cost benefit analysis and citizens' expectation in the case of coastal defense. In the case of renewable energy, controversies can be generated by regulatory mechanisms that are not necessarily aligned with the interests of industry or important social groups. We conclude that there is a need to integrate perspectives arising from utilitarian allocation of resources with those involving legislation and communal values in order to reconcile conflicting interests and better sustain marine social-ecological systems.

We examined case studies of youth-focused community and citizen science (CCS) and analyzed the learning processes and outcomes, and stewardship activities for youth, as well as contributions to site and species management, each as conservation outcomes. Examining two programs (one coastal and one water quality monitoring) across multiple sites in the San Francisco Bay Area, CA, in-and out-of-school settings, we qualitatively analyzed in-depth observations and pre- and post-program interviews with youth and educators. First, we examined evidence from the programs' impacts on conservation in the form of contribution to site and species management. We found that youth work informed regional resource management and local habitat improvement. Second, we examined the youth participants' environmental science agency (ESA). ESA combines not only understanding of environmental science and inquiry practices, but also the youths' identification with those practices and their developing belief that the ecosystem is something on which they act. We found that youth developed different aspects of environmental science agency in each context. We identify three key CCS processes through which many of the youth developed ESA: ensuring rigorous data collection, disseminating scientific findings to authentic external audiences, and investigating complex social-ecological systems. Our findings suggest that when CCS programs for youth support these processes, they can foster youth participation in current conservation actions, and build their capacity for future conservation actions.

The primary aim of this exercise is to provide guidance for (more) integrated EBM in the North Sea based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of those management measures in contributing to the conservation of marine biodiversity. A secondary aim is to identify the requirements of the knowledge base to guide such future EBM initiatives.Starting from the societal goals we performed a scoping exercise to identify a focal social-ecological system which is a subset of the full social-ecological system but considered adequate to guide EBM towards the achievement of those societal goals. A semi-quantitative risk assessment including all the relevant human activities, their pressures and the impacted ecosystem components was then applied to identify the main threats to the North Sea biodiversity and evaluate the effectiveness of the management measures to mitigate those threats.This exercise revealed the need for such risk-based approaches in providing a more integrated perspective but also the trade-off between being comprehensive but qualitative versus quantitative but limited in terms of the focal part of the SES that can be covered. The findings in this paper provide direction to the (further) development of EBM and its knowledge base that should ultimately allow an integrated perspective while maintaining its capacity to deliver the accuracy and detail needed for decision-making.

The focus is on critical cultural factors contributing to SES resilience. In particular, this work presents an integrated view of people situated in specific tundra landscapes that face significantly different prospects for adaptation depending on existing or planned infrastructure associated with oil and gas development. Factors contributing to general resilience are compared to those that are adapted to certain spatial and temporal contexts. Environmental factors include ample space and an abundance of resources, such as fish and game (e. g., geese), to augment the diet of not only the migratory herders, but also residents from coastal settlements. In contrast to other regions, such as the Nenets Okrug, Yamal Nenets households consist of intact nuclear families with high retention among youth in the nomadic tundra population. Accepting attitudes toward exogenous drivers such as climate change and industrial development appear to play a significant role in how people react to both extreme weather events and piecemeal confiscation or degradation of territory. Consciousness of their role as responsible stewards of the territories they occupy has likely been a factor in maintaining viable wildlife populations over centuries. Institutions administering reindeer herding have remained flexible, especially on Yamal, and so accommodate decision-making that is sensitive to herders' needs and timetables. This affects factors such as herd demography, mobility and energetics. Resilience is further facilitated within the existing governance regimes by herders' own agency, most recently in the post-Soviet shift to smaller, privately managed herds that can better utilize available pastures in a highly dynamic environment experiencing rapid socio-economic, climate and land use change.",,,,,,,,,45,0,2,0,15,0,50,,,1708-3087,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Lapland, Arctic Ctr, Rovaniemi, Finland",,,,2014-02-05,WOS:000329431700036,,

The risk analysis consists of several elements such as leakage probability, assessing the strength of environmental perturbation, and quantifying the ecological, economic, and social impacts. Here, the environmental perturbation aspect is addressed by using a marine system model of the North West European Shelf seas to simulate the consequences of CO2 additions such as those that could arise from a failure of geological sequestration schemes. Little information exists to guide the choice of leak scenario and many assumptions are required; for consistency the assumptions err towards greater impact and what would be in likelihood extreme scenarios. The simulations indicate that only the largest leakage scenarios tested are capable of producing perturbations that are likely to have environmental consequences beyond the locality of a leak event. It is shown that, given the available evidence, the chemical perturbation of a sequestration leak, regionally integrated, is likely to be insignificant when compared with that from continued non-mitigated atmospheric CO2 emissions and the subsequent acidification of the marine system. The potential ecological impacts of a large environmental CO2 perturbation are reviewed, indicating that the biogeochemical functioning and biodiversity are sensitive. The key unknowns that must be addressed in future research are identified; namely, the fine scale dispersion of CO2 and the ability of ecological systems to recover from perturbation.",,,,,,,,,71,0,0,0,48,0,73,,,0957-6509,2041-2967,,,,,,,,,,"Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth, Devon, EnglandProudman Oceanog Lab, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",,,,2009-05-01,WOS:000266358900007,,

In particular, their ability to mitigate coastal erosion by reducing the amount of wave power reaching the coast will be put to use - and this is the motivation for this work. We propose a new approach in which the wave farm has a dual purpose: to generate carbon-free energy and to contribute to coastal erosion management. We illustrate this approach by means of a case study: a dual-purpose wave farm off Xago, a beach-dune system in Asturias (N Spain) subject to severe erosion - manifested dramatically in the retreat of the dune - and located in the area earmarked for the first wave farm in Spain. The objective of this work is to establish whether or not the wave farm may be useful to counter the erosion of the beach-dune system. To this end a wave propagation model is coupled with a state-of-the-art coastal processes model and applied to analyse the response of the system under storm conditions in two scenarios: with and without the farm. The efficiency of the wave farm in mitigating erosion is determined by comparing the results in both scenarios by means of a series of coastal indicators defined ad hoc. We find that the farm reduces storm induced erosion particularly where it is most acute, in the dune front, and thus contributes to alleviate the current erosive trends. This opens up exciting possibilities of using dual wave farms in lieu of, or as a complement to, coastal structures or beach nourishment. As wave energy develops into a major renewable energy source in the coming decades, dual wave farms are poised to constitute a breakthrough in coastal erosion management.",,,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,7,0,39,,,0964-5691,1873-524X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Plymouth, Sch Engn, Marine Bldg, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandTYPSA Grp, Renewable Energy Div, Edificio Manuel Borso,C Botiguers 5-5a Planta, Valencia 46980, SpainUniv Oviedo, Dept Geol, Campus Llamanquique,C Jesus Arias de Velasco S-N, Oviedo 33005, Spain",TYPSA Grp,,,2018-06-28,WOS:000435063400002,,

An improved understanding of the economic, social and environmental impacts of this sector, and how they compare with those of other energy systems, is therefore necessary to support energy policy and planning decisions. The ecosystem services approach provides a more holistic perspective of socio-ecological systems than traditional environmental impact assessment. The approach also makes possible comparisons across disparate ecological communities because it considers the societal implications of ecological impacts rather than remaining focused on specific species or habitats. By reporting outcomes in societal terms, the approach also facilitates communication with decision makers and the evaluation of trade-offs. The impacts of offshore wind development on ecosystem services were assessed through a qualitative process of mapping the ecological and cultural parameters evaluated in 78 empirical studies onto the Common International Classification for Ecosystem Services (CICES) framework. The research demonstrates that a wide range of biophysical variables can be consistently mapped onto the CICES hierarchy, supporting development of the ecosystem service approach from a broad concept into an operational tool for impact assessment. However, to improve confidence in the outcomes, there remains a need for direct measurement of the impacts of offshore wind farms on ecosystem services and for standardised definitions of the assumptions made in linking ecological and cultural change to ecosystem service impacts. The process showed that offshore wind farms have mixed impacts across different ecosystem services, with negative effects on the seascape and the spread of non-native species, and positive effects on Commercial fish and shellfish, potentially of most significance. The work also highlighted the need for a better understanding of long term and population level effects of offshore wind farms on species and habitats, and how these are placed in the context of other pressures on the marine environment.",,,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,9,0,40,,,1364-0321,,,,,,,,,,,"Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England",,,,2017-04-01,WOS:000396184900021,,

The target area is the Portuguese maritime pilot zone, So Pedro de Moel, which is located in the central part of the Portuguese continental nearshore. A generic wave farm was considered and various transmission situations were analyzed. The study started with the situation without wave farm (zero absorption) and subsequently different scenarios were considered by gradually increasing the conditions to the hypothetic case of the total absorption. For each case study, model simulations were performed covering the entire year 2009 using a wave prediction system based on Wave Watch 3, for the wave generation at the level of the entire North Atlantic Ocean, and on SWAN, for the coastal wave transformation. In this way, a comprehensive picture of the possible impact of the wave farm is provided. The results show that the presence of a wave farm operating offshore has a strong influence on the wave conditions immediately down wave. Although this influence is usually attenuated at the level of the coastline, it appears as obvious a general decrease in terms of significant wave height due to the wave farm, but also some other wave parameters are modified.

The objective of this work is to determine whether the beach morphology can be altered by the operation of the wave farm, and if so, to quantify this alteration. For this purpose, we examine how the farm affects the modal state of the beach with reference to a baseline (no farm) scenario. The modal state is defined based on an empirical classification that accounts for wave conditions, tidal regime and sediment size. As a beach typically goes through different modal states, we determine the percentages of time in an average year corresponding to each state in the baseline scenario, and how these percentages are altered by a wave farm as a function of its distance from the coast. This methodology is illustrated through a case study: Perranporth Beach (UK), an area of great potential for wave energy development. High-resolution numerical modelling is used, with two levels of grid refinement. We find that the wave farm has a relevant impact on the modal state of the system, which passes from wave-dominated to tide-dominated during significant periods of time. The sensitivity analysis, involving three cases with the farm at distances of 2 km, 4 km and 6 km from the beach, showed that the farm-to-coast distance plays a major role. Thus, the shift from a wave-to a tide-dominated beach is exacerbated in the case of the wave farm closest to the coastline, with the submarine bar vanishing over long periods of time. We conclude that the presence of the wave farm drastically alters the morphological response of the beach, and that this alteration is strongly dependent on the farm-to-coast distance.

To demonstrate effects of wave farm on evolution of the two parameters mentioned above more clearly, Zhangjiapu (ZJP) nearshore areas are regarded as the potential wave farm location. There are large wetland areas having sensitive environment problems. Therefore, this chapter studied the evolution of nearshore hydrodynamic environment in ZJP nearshore areas, including wave climate and wave-induced longshore current, which was caused by the installation of wave farm. Numerical simulation has been adopted to investigate the effects induced by wave farm on nearshore hydrodynamic environment. The wave and wave-induced longshore current have been simulated by flow model Delft3D. The significant wave height and period gotten by numerical model agree with measured data generally.

The objective of this work is to investigate the effects of wave farms on the longshore sediment transport and shoreline evolution of a gravel-dominated beach and, in particular, its sensitivity to the longshore position of the farm based on eight scenarios. Nearshore wave propagation patterns are computed by means of a spectral wave propagation model (SWAN), variations in sediment transport rates induced by the farm are calculated, and a one-line model is applied to determine the shoreline position and dry beach area. The significant wave height at breaking is reduced in the lee of the wave farm, dampening sediment transport. We find that changes in the dry beach area induced by the wave farm are highly sensitive to its alongshore position, and may result in: (i) erosion relative to the baseline scenario (without wave farm) in three of the eight scenarios, (ii) accretion in three other scenarios, and (iii) negligible effects in the remaining two. These results prove that the alongshore position of the wave farm controls the response of the beach to the extent that it may shift from accretionary to erosionary, and provide evidence of its effectiveness in countering erosion if appropriately positioned. This effectiveness opens up the possibility of using wave farms not only to generate carbon-free energy but also to manage coastal erosion, thus strengthening the case for the development of wave energy.

The influence of wave farms, i. e., arrays of wave energy converters, on coastal processes, in particular sediment transport patterns, has been analysed in recent works; however, their influence on coastal flooding has not been addressed so far. The objective of this work is to investigate whether a wave farm can provide some protection from flooding on the coast in its lee through a case study: a gravel-dominated beach in southern Spain (Playa Granada). We consider three sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios: the present situation (SLR0), an optimistic projection (SLR1) and a pessimistic projection (SLR2). Two state-of-the-art numerical models, SWAN and XBeach-G, are applied to determine the wave propagation patterns, total run-up and flooded dry beach area. The results indicate that the absorption of wave power by the wave farm affects wave propagation in its lee and, in particular, wave heights, with alongshore-averaged reductions in breaking wave heights about 10% (25%) under westerly (easterly) storms. These lower significant wave heights, in turn, result in alongshore-averaged run-up reductions for the three scenarios, which decreases with increasing SLR values from 5.9% (6.8%) to 1.5% (5.1%) for western (eastern) storms. Importantly, the dry beach area flooded under westerly (easterly) storms is also reduced by 5.7% (3.2%), 3.3% (4.9%) and 1.99% (4.5%) in scenarios SLR0, SLR1 and SLR2, respectively. These findings prove that a wave farm can actually reduce coastal flooding on its leeward coast. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper studies the modification of hydrodynamic processes at the coastline induced by nearshore wave farms using a recently developed phase-resolving wave-flow model. Changes to nearshore hydrodynamics were assessed for various farm configurations of submerged point-absorbers positioned 1-3 km offshore that were subject to realistic sea-states. In the lee of the farms, wave heights were attenuated and onshore directed flows were generated that extended several hundred meters shoreward but did not impinge the coast. For scenarios in which the wave shadow extended to the coast, the nearshore wave height and setup were reduced resulting in longshore pressure gradients driving longshore flows that converged in the lee of the farms. Changes were largest for compact farms at smaller offshore distances, and conversely, were significantly smaller for wider spaced arrays at greater offshore distances. Based on a bulk longshore sediment transport formulation, the converging flow patterns indicate conditions favourable for the accumulation of sediment in the direct lee and divergence of sediments at locations up/down coast from the farm, suggesting a reorientation of the shoreline in response to the wave farm configurations considered.

Previous studies have investigated the effect of energy extraction by wave energy devices through the use of spectral models such as SWAN, representing a wave farm as one or more barriers within the model domain and applying a constant wave energy transmission percentage across the whole wave spectrum incident at the barrier. However, this is an unrealistic representation of the behaviour of real wave energy converters. These will exhibit frequency-dependent energy absorption characteristics that will correspond to the spectral response of the device, and may reflect its ability to be tuned to extract energy at particular frequencies. This study describes a modification of the SWAN source code to enable frequency-dependent wave energy transmission through a barrier. A detailed analysis of the wave climate at the Wave Hub wave farm site is also presented, with a particular focus on the occurrence of bimodal sea states. The modified SWAN code is used to assess how impact predictions for typically occurring sea states may differ when using frequency-dependent rather than constant wave energy transmission, with reference to a previous study using the unmodified code (Millar, Smith and Reeve, 2007 [1]). The results illustrate the dependence of the magnitude of the impact on both the response function of the devices and the spectral sea state in which they are operating. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that tidal elevation and tidal currents can have a significant effect on waves and that tidal forcing and waves have a significant effect on bottom shear stresses. Waves can impact on the processes related to the bottom boundary layer and mixing intensity in the water column. The wave farm has an impact on the gradients of radiation shear stresses and bottom shear stresses that modify current speeds and wave heights, which in turn impact on the near-shore sediment transport and the resulting morphological changes.

The objective of this work is to investigate the role played by the farm layout on the wave propagation patterns leewards and the implications for longshore sediment transport (LST) and shoreline evolution on a gravel-dominated deltaic coast. Changes in wave propagation in four scenarios, corresponding to as many wave farm layouts, are computed by means of a spectral numerical model (Delft3D-WAVE) under (i) low-energy and storm conditions, and (ii) westerly and easterly waves -the two prevailing wave directions. On this basis, sediment transport rates are computed and changes in the shoreline position assessed using a one-line model. To quantify the impact of the wave farm on the nearshore wave conditions, sediment transport and shoreline, we define three ad hoc indicators: the non-dimensional wave height reduction, the non-dimensional LST rate reduction and the non-dimensional shoreline advance. Significant wave heights decrease in the lee of the wave farm, with the consequent reduction in LST rates. As a result, the dry beach area increases in every scenario under both westerly and easterly waves. We find that case studies with the WECs arranged on fewer rows but covering a greater stretch of coastline provide better coastal protection.

All these different tipping elements share common characteristics related to their nonlinear nature. They can also interact with each other leading to synergies that can lead to cascading tipping points. Even if the probability of each tipping event is low, they can happen relatively rapidly, involve multiple variables, and have large societal impacts. Therefore, adaptation measures and management in general should extend their focus beyond slow and continuous changes, into abrupt, nonlinear, possibly cascading, high impact phenomena. Remote sensing observations are found to be decisive in the understanding and determination of early warning signals of many tipping elements. Nevertheless, considerable research still remains to properly incorporate these data in the current generation of coupled Earth system models. This is a key prerequisite to correctly develop robust decadal prediction systems that may help to assess the risk of crossing thresholds potentially crucial for society. The prediction of tipping points remains difficult, notably due to stochastic resonance, i.e. the interaction between natural variability and anthropogenic forcing, asking for large ensembles of predictions to correctly assess the risks. Furthermore, evaluating the proximity to crucial thresholds using process-based understanding of each system remains a key aspect to be developed for an improved assessment of such risks. This paper finally proposes a few research avenues concerning the use of remote sensing data and the need for combining different sources of data, and having long and precise-enough time series of the key variables needed to monitor Earth system tipping elements.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,0,15,,,0169-3298,1573-0956,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bordeaux, EPOC OASU, UMR CNRS 5805, Environm & Paleoenvironm Ocean & Continentaux EPO, Allee Geoffroy St Hilaire, F-33615 Pessac, FranceUniv Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, SwitzerlandBgeos GmbH, Ind Str 1, A-2100 Korneuburg, AustriaUniv Vienna, Austrian Polar Res Inst, Zimmer B0410,Univ Str 7, A-1010 Vienna, AustriaUniv Grenoble Alpes, IGE, Grenoble INP, CNRS,IRD, F-38000 Grenoble, FranceUniv Littoral Cote dOpale, Univ Lille, UMR 8187, Lab Oceanol & Geosci,CNRS, F-62930 Wimereux, FranceNatl Res Council Italy, CNR ISMAR Lerici, I-19032 Lerici, SP, Italy",Bgeos GmbH,,,2020-09-17,WOS:000565834600001,,

In this paper, modelling methods used in the scientific literature to study wave farm impacts on coastal processes are reviewed, with the aim of determining modelling guidance for impact assessments. Effects on wave climate, beach morphology, and the surfing resource for coastal water users are considered. A novel parameterisation for the WEC array transmission coefficient is presented that, for the first time, uses the permitted power rating of the wave farm, which is usually well defined at the impact assessment stage, to estimate the maximum likely absorption of a permitted WEC array. A coastal processes impact assessment case study from a wave farm in south-west Ireland is used to illustrate the application of the reviewed methods, and demonstrates that using the new rated power transmission coefficient' rather than a WEC-derived transmission coefficient or complete energy absorption scenario can make the difference between significant and non-significant levels of coastal impacts being predicted.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,0,9,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Plymouth Univ, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Drake Circus PL4 8AA, England",Plymouth Univ,,,2018-10-01,WOS:000449293500025,,

First, three possible locations are defined with a view to avoiding potential environmental impacts and the interference of the wave farm with existing uses of the marine space. Then, the power performance of six technologies at the selected locations is computed by means of a comprehensive methodology based on high resolution numerical modelling, which guarantees accurate and reliable results. Significant spatial variability of the resource over short length scales is found, which translates into large variations in the performance of the various WECs considered. On this basis, the most appropriate site and WEC for the area are determined, thereby the integrated approach for installing a wave farm which may be used in any other region of interest is demonstrated.

The influence of the size and the placement of each unit in the wave farm is presented with a farm-unit flicker ratio, compared with the square-root of unit hypothesis (noise behavior), as a function of wave direction by taking into account wave direction dispersion.

The objective of this work is to investigate, for the first time, how the coastal protection performance against flooding is affected by WEC geometry. This is done by means of a case study with WaveCat WECs (floating, overtopping WECs) deployed off the Playa Granada beach (Spain). To this end, two models of WaveCat WECs with different geometries are tested in a laboratory tank at a 1:30 scale under low-, mid- and high-energy sea states representative of the wave conditions of Playa Granada. The geometries differed in the angle between the twin hulls (wedge angle) of WaveCat: 30 degrees and 60 degrees. The reflection and transmission coefficients thus obtained are used in a coupled numerical modelling approach, combining wave and coastal processes models (SWAN and XBeach-G, respectively). We find that WECs with an angle of 60 degrees provide more (less) protection for long (short) wave periods in terms of reductions in wave height and run-up on the beach. As for the flooded dry beach areas, they are generally smaller for WECs with 60 degrees, with only some exceptions under mild conditions. Thus, considering that beach inundation usually occurs under high-energy, storm conditions, we conclude that the wave farm composed by WECs with a wedge angle of 60 degrees is more efficient against coastal flooding.

This is largely due to the accompanying greenhouse gas emissions and its catastrophic impacts on the environment, which are expected to worsen with the changing climate. Energy from ocean waves can be harnessed and converted into electricity with devices referred to as wave energy converters (WECs). Many researchers have studied the impacts of the WECs on coastal hydrodynamics, however, the impact on morphodynamics is not as well understood. In this paper, we review studies that assess the impacts of wave farms on coastal erosion.

The study explores the macrozoobenthos (biofouling) colonization at an offshore platform which is comparable to offshore wind turbine foundations. A total of 183 single samples were taken and the parameters water depth and time were considered comparing biofouling masses and communities. The blue mussel Mytilus edulis, Anthozoa and the Amphipoda Jassa spp. were the dominant species. The community from the 1 m zone and those from the 5 and 20-28 m zones can clearly be differentiated. The 10 m zone community represents the transition between the M. edulis dominated 1 m and 5 m zones and the Anthozoa dominated 20-28 m zone. In the future offshore wind farms, thousands of wind turbine foundations will provide habitat for a hard bottom fauna which is otherwise restricted to the sparse rocky habitats scattered within extensive sedimentary soft bottoms of the German Bight. However, offshore wind power foundations cannot be considered natural rock equivalents as they selectively increase certain natural hard bottom species. The surface of the construction (1280 m(2)) was covered by an average of 4300 kg biomass. This foundation concentrates on its footprint area (1024 m(2)) 35 times more macrozoobenthos biomass than the same area of soft bottom in the German exclusive economic zone (0.12 kg m(-2)), functioning as a biomass hotspot. Concerning the temporal biomass variation, we assume that at least 2700 kg biomass was exported on a yearly basis. 345 x 10(4) single mussel shells of different sizes were produced during the study period. It is anticipated that the M. edulis abundance will increase in the North Sea due to the expansion of the offshore wind farm development. This will result in the enhanced production of secondary hard substrate (mussel shells) and its associated fauna and will intensify filtration rates of the seawater. This predicted ecological system change is coined the 'Mytilusation' of the German Bight. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The 2014 winter (January, February and March), and especially the first fortnight of February, was a stormy winter with rough sea state conditions.

Specifically, deltaic coasts are highly vulnerable systems due to their low-lying characteristics. This paper investigates the role of wave energy converter (WEC) farms on the protection of an eroding gravel-dominated deltaic coast (Guadalfeo, southern Spain). Eight scenarios with different alongshore locations of the wave farm were defined and results were compared with the present (no farm) configuration of the coast. Assuming that storm conditions drive the main destruction to the coast, we analysed the impact of the most energetic storm conditions and quantified the effects of the location of the farm. Significant wave heights in the lee of the farm were calculated by means of a calibrated wave propagation model (Delft3D-Wave); whereas wave run-up and morphological changes in eight beach profiles were quantified by means of a calibrated morphodynamic model (XBeach-G). The farm induces average reductions in significant wave heights at 10 m water depth and wave run-up on the coast down to 18.3% and 10.6%, respectively, in the stretch of beach most affected by erosion problems (Playa Granada). Furthermore, the erosion of the beach reduces by 44.5% in Playa Granada and 23.3% in the entire deltaic coast. Combining these results with previous works at the study site allowed selecting the best alternative of wave farm location based not only on coastal protection but also on energetic performance criteria. This work, whose methodology is feasibly extensible to other coasts worldwide, provides insights into the role of the alongshore location of WEC farms on wave propagation, run-up and morphological storm response of deltaic coasts.

Coastal wetlands are complex social-ecological systems that occur at all latitudes, from polar regions to the tropics. This overview covers wetlands in five continents. The wetlands are of varying size, catchment size, human population and stages of economic development. Economic sectors and activities in and around the coastal wetlands and their catchments exert multiple, direct pressures. These pressures affect the state of the wetland environment, ecology and valuable ecosystem services. All the coastal wetlands were found to be affected in some ways, irrespective of the conservation status. The main economic sectors were agriculture, animal rearing including aquaculture, fisheries, tourism, urbanization, shipping, industrial development and mining. Specific human activities include land reclamation, damming, draining and water extraction, construction of ponds for aquaculture and salt extraction, construction of ports and marinas, dredging, discharge of effluents from urban and industrial areas and logging, in the case of mangroves, subsistence hunting and oil and gas extraction. The main pressures were loss of wetland habitat, changes in connectivity affecting hydrology and sedimentology, as well as contamination and pollution. These pressures lead to changes in environmental state, such as erosion, subsidence and hypoxia that threaten the sustainability of the wetlands. There are also changes in the state of the ecology, such as loss of saltmarsh plants and seagrasses, and mangrove trees, in tropical wetlands. Changes in the structure and function of the wetland ecosystems affect ecosystem services that are often underestimated. The loss of ecosystem services impacts human welfare as well as the regulation of climate change by coastal wetlands. These cumulative impacts and multi-stressors are further aggravated by indirect pressures, such as sea-level rise.",,,,,,,,,76,2,0,0,49,0,82,,,2296-701X,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Algarve, Ctr Marine & Environm Res, Gambelas Campus, Faro, PortugalNILU IMPACT, Kjeller, NorwaySagremarisco Viveiros Marisco Lda, Vila Do Bispo, PortugalIADO Inst Argentina Oceanog, Blanca, ArgentinaLouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Sch Coast & Environm SCE, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv Southern Denmark, Dept Sociol Environm & Business Econ, Odense, DenmarkUniv Portsmouth, Inst Marine Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Portsmouth, Hants, EnglandChinese Acad Sci, Yantai Inst Coastal Zone Res, Yantai, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R ChinaZhejiang A&F Univ, Sch Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou, Peoples R ChinaGovt India, Natl Ctr Sustainable Coastal Management, Minist Environm Forests & Climate Change, Anna Univ Campus, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, IndiaBedford Inst Oceanog, Nat Resources Canada, Dartmouth, NS, CanadaOGS Natl Inst Oceanog & Expt Geophys, Trieste, ItalyNatl Inst Marine Sci & Technol INSTM, Marine Environm Lab, Salammbo, TunisiaEast China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaUniv Ca Foscari Venezia, Dept Sci Environm Comp & Stat, Venice, ItalyUniv Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Cambridge, MD USAVietnam Acad Water Resources, Inst Coastal & Offshore Engn, Hanoi, VietnamUniv Lisbon, MARE Ctr Ciencias Mar Ado Ambiente, Fac Sci, Lisbon, PortugalUniv Lisbon, Fac Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes, Lisbon, PortugalDeutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Dept Land Surface, German Aerosp Ctr, Earth Observat Ctr,German Remote Sensing Data Ctr, Wessling, Germany",Sagremarisco Viveiros Marisco LdaIADO Inst Argentina OceanogVietnam Acad Water Resources,,,2020-07-07,WOS:000553425000001,,

Using 9 years of hourly wave resource data and a typical terminator wave energy converter performance curve, hourly electricity generation profiles and normalised annual wave energy capacity factors were calculated in spatially distributed polygons of the NEM. A conservative wave farm design with 3.35 wave energy converters per km, and environmental, marine park and general exclusion zone constraints, has been assumed. The polygon spanning western Victoria has the greatest capacity factor of 0.44. Integrating the hourly electricity generation data revealed that polygons in Tasmania can generate the most electricity, equal to 44.4 TWh/yr. Total generation over all NEM polygons was calculated to be 275 TWh/yr. This exceeds Australia's total electricity generation of 255 TWh for the 2011-2012 financial year.

It is expected that wave energy will be one of the fastest-growing energy resources in the next decade, offering an enormous potential source of sustainable energy. This research investigates the placement optimization of oscillating buoy-type wave energy converters (WEC). The design of a wave farm consisting of an array of fully submerged three-tether buoys is evaluated. In a wave farm, buoy positions have a notable impact on the farm's output. Optimizing the buoy positions is a challenging research problem because of very complex interactions (constructive and destructive) between buoys. The main purpose of this research is maximizing the power output of the farm through the placement of buoys in a size-constrained environment. This paper proposes a new hybrid approach of the heuristic local search combined with a numerical optimization method that utilizes a knowledge-based surrogate power model. We compare the proposed hybrid method with other state-of-the-art search methods in five different wave scenarios -- one simplified irregular wave model and four real wave climates. Our method considerably outperforms all previous heuristic methods in terms of both quality of achieved solutions and the convergence-rate of search in all tested wave regimes.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-11-19,PPRN:22460532,,

Methods to evaluate and compare the wave energy resource at different locations are required in order to inform the developers of Wave Energy Converter (WEC) projects and allow them to select the most favorable sites for achieving optimal power capture and economic performance from their devices as the wave energy industry begins to approach the commercial deployment of Wave Farms, arrays of full-scale WECs.In this paper alternative techniques for the characterization of wave energy resource are presented, with particular emphasis on the identification of the practicable power available for extraction and the comparison between different potential locations for Wave Farm developments. The effect of introducing a threshold, beyond which the theoretical wave power is no longer deemed exploitable and ignored for the purposes of resource evaluation, is highlighted in order to account for the reduced device output that can be expected in severe storm conditions. In addition, the relative performance that could be expected of typical WECs located at different sites is determined using the power matrices made publicly available by the a number of device developers.These methods are applied to measured buoy data to allow for the comparison of the wave energy resource at the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site, a grid connected location for the testing of full scale WECs being developed near Belmullet, County Mayo, by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), with the incident wave conditions experienced at locations on the Pacific and Atlantic Coasts of the United States. Instances where sea states with the same summary statistics display radically different spectral shapes have been identified, consequently the level of variation in the dominant spectral shapes that can exist between two ocean sites is also investigated. The effect that this spectral variation can have on the characterization of the wave energy resource at different sites and on the performance of WECs is demonstrated and discussed. It is shown that the sea states which are responsible for the largest contributions of wave power, as opposed to the most commonly occurring conditions, which should be deemed most significant for the deployment and operation of WEC installations.",,,,,MTS/IEEE OCEANS ConferenceMTS/IEEE OCEANS Conference,"SEP 19-22, 2011SEP 19-22, 2011",Marine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE; OESMarine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE; OES,"Kona, HIKona, HI",4,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,,,978-0-933957-39-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ Coll Cork, Hydraul & Maritime Res Ctr, Cork, Ireland",,,,2012-03-21,WOS:000299005800107,,

Sea waves have one of the highest energy densities among the Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Today, the largest problem in harvesting wave energy is obtaining reliability of the technology and bringing the cost down.The main types of wave energy converters are:- The oscillating water column, which consists of a partially submerged, hollow structure open to the sea below the water line.- Overtopping devices that collect the water of incident waves in order to drive one or more low head turbines.- Point absorbers (floating or mounted on the sea bed), which usually provide a heave motion that is converted by mechanical, magnetic and/or hydraulic systems in linear or rotational motion for driving electrical generators.-Surging devices that exploit the horizontal particle velocity in a wave to drive a deflector or to generate the pumping effect of a flexible bag facing the wave front.Obviously the amount of available energy depends on the different distribution of the wave energy on the world coastlines. The most energetic sites are situated on the west coasts of the oceans at middle latitudes. European and Australian west coasts reach amounts of 80 kW/m of available wave energy; in fact, the first wave farms have been installed in Portugal and Scotland where the energy due to the waves reaches these highest values.The power in a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude and to the period of the motion. Therefore, long period (>7-10 s), large amplitude (>2 m) waves have energy fluxes commonly averaging between 40 and 70 kW per m width of oncoming wave. Situated at the end of the long, stormy fetch of the Atlantic, the wave climate along the western coast of Europe is characterized by particularly high energy.In the Mediterranean basin, the annual power level off the coasts of the European countries varies between 4 and 11 kW/m, the highest values occurring in the area of the south-western Aegean Sea. In the Thyrrenian Sea, this lowest value of 4 kW/m is acceptable as a limit for possible location of an offshore wave farm.In order to identify the best sites and to optimize the location of new wave farms offshore of the coastlines of the Campania region (South of Italy), the significant wave height data set of ISPRA has been used, on which the Italian Wave Atlas is based. The wave buoys data are useful to calibrate the wave prediction model WWIII implemented by the Department of Applied Sciences of the University Parthenope, which simulates the most significant wave storm events of the last ten years. This procedure has been used to produce in the recent past a risk assessment of the Campanian coastlines to the wave impact, so it can also be used to evaluate the potential wave energy to be converted offshore of the Campanian coasts.",,,,,"1st International Conference on Physical Coastal Processes, Management and Engineering1st International Conference on Physical Coastal Processes, Management and Engineering","SEP 14-16, 2009SEP 14-16, 2009",Wessex Inst Technol; Univ Pharthenope; Univ Las Palmas; WIT Transact Ecol & EnvironmWessex Inst Technol; Univ Pharthenope; Univ Las Palmas; WIT Transact Ecol & Environm,MALTAMALTA,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,1743-3541,,978-1-84564-200-6,,,,,,,,,"Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Appl Sci, Naples, Italy",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000274847500012,,

However, they represent an unexplored frontier in marine urban environments, which are also central to human-environment interactions in coastal cities. We evaluated the feasibility and potential environmental impacts of integrating small-scale seaweed farming into urban seawalls. We developed and tested the efficacy of a prototype planter unit for cultivating the red, agar-producing seaweed, Hydropuntia edulis, above its typical tidal range on urban seawalls in Singapore. Field trial results suggest that H. edulis can be successfully grown in the mid- and upper-intertidal zones on seawalls by using planters with water-retaining features. However, based on results from life cycle assessment (LCA) and integrated biological models of seaweed production, we found that the choice of materials for constructing planters and their positioning on the seawall were critical in determining net environmental impacts. Farmed seaweeds had an impressive capacity for carbon, nutrient, and metal uptake according to model estimates, but these benefits were outweighed by emissions from energy- and contaminant-intensive materials that are commonly used in seawall eco-engineering. At low tidal heights, farmed seaweeds were also more readily dislodged, potentially leading to greater flux of detrital biomass to adjacent systems. This work highlights both the potential of seaweed farming for enhancing the multifunctionality of urban waterfronts, and the importance of objectively weighing overall environmental consequences of such approaches before advancing them as eco-engineering solutions.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 177558, Singapore",,,,2020-06-16,WOS:000537670100016,,

At the same time, anthropogenic projects such as land reclamation could change the potential effects of sea-level rise (SLR).

A numerical model was applied to simulate the changes of hydrodynamic and solute transport with 0.0, 0.3, and 0.5 m of SLR in two groups of scenarios (i.e., before and after land reclamation). SLR alone substantially affected the hydrodynamics and strengthened the tidal influence. SLR resulted in a loss of intertidal regions and an increased tidal prism in the bay. Reclamation further magnified SLR's effects on both the hydrodynamics and solute transport. The tidal energy entering the bay during each tidal phase increased by 39.2% and 66.4% with 0.3 and 0.5 m of SLR (respectively) before reclamation, versus 40.7% and 68.9% (respectively) after reclamation. The reclamation projects in the bay helped the saline sea water to intrude further upstream, and magnified the effects of SLR on variations in seasonal salinity. SLR also decreased the bay's ability to exchange water. However, the reclamation accelerated the solute circulation inside the bay, considerably reduced the water age, and offset the SLR's effects on the bay's ability to exchange water with the adjacent sea. The increase in salinity variation due to the combined effects of SLR and reclamation might exert stress on the ecological system of the inner bay, which contains a Ramsar wetland.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,7,0,12,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Room 6-18A,Haking Wong Bldg, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000412127500005,,

Traditional single-issue management largely failed to protect the full suite of ES. Ecosystem-based management (EBM) promotes resilient social-ecological systems that provide ES. To implement EBM, an ES approach is useful: (1) characterize major ES provided (magnitude, geographic extent, monetary value, trends, and stakeholders), (2) identify trade-offs, (3) determine desired outcomes, and (4) manage anthropogenic activities accordingly. Here we apply the ES approach (steps 1-2) to an open ocean ecosystem, the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP), an area of 21 million km 2 that includes waters of 12 nations and the oceanic commons, using 35 years (1975-2010) of fisheries and economic data, and 20 years (1986-2006) of ship-based survey data. We examined commercial fisheries, carbon storage, recreational fishing, and biodiversity as the major provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting ES, respectively. Average catch value (using U.S. import prices for fish) for the 10 most commercially fished species was $2.7 billion yr(-1). The value of carbon export to the deep ocean was $12.9 billion yr(-1) (using average European carbon market prices). For two fisheries-depleted dolphin populations, the potential value of rebuilding carbon stores was $1.6 million (cumulative); for exploited fish stocks it was also $1.6 million (an estimated reduction of 544,000 mt). Sport fishing expenditures totaled $1.2 billion yr(-1), from studies of three popular destinations. These initial, conservative estimates do not represent a complete summary of ETP ES values. We produced species richness maps for cetaceans, seabirds, and ichthyoplankton, and a sightings density map for marine turtles. Over 1/3 of cetacean, seabird, and marine turtle species occur in the ETP, and diversity (or density) hotspots are widespread. This study fills several gaps in the assessment of marine and coastal ES by focusing on an oceanic habitat, utilizing long-term datasets, mapping the spatial distribution of ecological components, and concentrating on an area beyond Europe and the USA.

Eight scenarios with different alongshore locations of the wave farm were defined and results were compared with the present (no farm) configuration of the coast. Assuming that storm conditions drive the main destruction to the coast, we analysed the impact of the most energetic storm conditions and quantified the effects of the location of the farm. Significant wave heights in the lee of the farm were calculated by means of a calibrated wave propagation model (Delft3D-Wave); whereas wave run-up and morphological changes in eight beach profiles were quantified by means of a calibrated morphodynamic model (XBeach-G). The farm induces average reductions in significant wave heights at 10m water depth and wave run-up on the coast down to 18.3% and 10.6%, respectively, in the stretch of beach most affected by erosion problems (Playa Granada). Furthermore, the erosion of the beach reduces by 44.5% in Playa Granada and 23.3% in the entire deltaic coast. Combining these results with previous works at the study site allowed selecting the best alternative of wave farm location based not only on coastal protection but also on energetic performance criteria.

The project was conducted in partnership with indigenous people who share a long and close relationship with caribou and self-identify as the Caribou People. The Caribou People desired to share their knowledge, experiences, challenges, and coping strategies with other indigenous communities and with scientists and wildlife managers. Six communities in the North American Arctic participated in the project, with 99 people interviewed about the ecological, cultural, spiritual, and nutritional aspects of their relationship with caribou. The Caribou People wished to tell their stories with their own voices, without the filter of a researcher's interpretations of their messages. The communities defined three project goals, i.e., documentation, communication, and sharing of knowledge, and we identified methodological challenges associated with these goals. Through videography, we sought to overcome these challenges and accomplish community goals, which formed the basis for our project's evaluation. Participants reported changes and concerns ranging from impacts of oil and gas exploration, mining activities, nonlocal hunting, and high energy costs to impacts of climate-related conditions. All interviews were made available in the public domain via the Internet for sharing. In the view of the communities, videography preserved their legacy and served as a repository of traditional knowledge in changing times; visual images were seen as a powerful medium to communicate with policy makers and the public at large and were seen as a preferred informal, unstructured approach. We have (1) described the approach of the Voices of the Caribou People project as a collaborative video methodology and (2) discussed the effectiveness of this method in meeting the goals of participatory research.

Phytoplankton abundance and community structure can reflect the change of conditions of marine environment and they influence organisms at high trophic level (e. g. fish) through a bottom-up control mechanism. The water around Lidao had a healthy ecosystem and abundant fisheries resources for a long time, while environmental deterioration and over-fishing put much pressure upon this ecosystem in recent years. According to the previously reported studies, artificial reefs were considered as effective methods of repairing marine ecological system by providing shelter for fishery resources, restricting the harvest of destructive fishing gears (e. g. trawl) and altering the flow distribution. Therefore, the local government conducted an artificial reef construction project from the year of 2005 in order to improve the marine environment and recovery fisheries resources in this area. The previous studies on estimating the multiplication of artificial reef mostly focused on nekton and seldom reported the effect of artificial reef on phytoplankton. In this study, we used multivariate statistical analysis to compare the parameters of phytoplankton community at different times (four seasons) and locations (artificial and control areas) to assess the status of primary productivity in this region after carrying out an artificial reef project. Based on four cruise survey data carried out in the artificial reef and control area around Lidao Island, Shandong Provence, China (37[degree]12'51. 00[approximately][degree]37 13'16. 00N, 122[degree]35' 56. 30[approximately]122[degree]37' 03. 00E) from Sept. 2012 to Aug. 2013, we explored the effect of artificial reef on the phytoplankton community structure and environmental conditions. The results showed that a total of 78 species which belong to 40 genera of 5 phyla were identified in the artificial reef and control area, mainly composed of 65 diatom species and 10 dinoflagellate species. The main dominant species were Licmophora abbreviate, Paralia sulcata, Coscinodiscus asteromphalus among others. Paralia sulcata was the predominant species in spring, autumn and winter. Dominant species and phytoplankton community structure varied among seasons significantly, but they did not change between artificial and control area. Phytoplankton community structure parameters (species number, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Pielou evenness index, Margalef richness index, and chla concentration) were not significantly different between reef and control area except that phytoplankton abundance in the reef area was significantly higher than that in control area in spring and summer, but significant difference was found among seasons (p<0. 01). The similar phytoplankton community structure was probably caused by short settle time of artificial reef, closeness of reef and control area, influence of ocean currents and up-down effect of zooplankton. Redundancy analysis (RDA) results revealed that significant factors influencing phytoplankton community structure in order of importance were transparency, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), BOD5, pH, PO4-P, temperature, COD and SiO3-Si. Dissolved oxygen (DO) and salinity had no significant effect on phytoplankton community structure.",,,,,,,,,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,,,1672-5174,,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China, Coll Fisheries, Qingdao, 266003, China",,,,2016-10-13,ZOOREC:ZOOR15209056936,,

An understanding of the hydrodynamic interactions in such arrays is essential for determining optimum layouts of 'WECs, as well as calculating the area of ocean that the farms will require. It is equally important to consider the potential impact of wave farms on the local and distal wave climates and coastal processes; a poor understanding of the resulting environmental impact may hamper progress, as it would make planning consents more difficult to obtain. It is therefore clear that an understanding the interactions between WECs within a farm is vital for the continued development of the wave energy industry.To support WEC farm design, a range of different numerical models have been developed, with both wave phase-resolving and wave phase-averaging models now available. Phase-resolving methods are primarily based on potential flow models and include semi-analytical techniques, boundary element methods and methods involving the mild-slope equations. Phase-averaging methods are all based around spectral wave models, with supra-grid and sub-grid wave farm models available as alternative implementations.The aims, underlying principles, strengths, weaknesses and obtained results of the main numerical methods currently used for modelling wave energy converter arrays are described in this paper, using a common framework. This allows a qualitative comparative analysis of the different methods to be performed at the end of the paper. This includes consideration of the conditions under which the models may be applied, the output of the models and the relationship between array size and computational effort. Guidance for developers is also presented on the most suitable numerical method to use for given aspects of WEC farm design. For instance, certain models are more suitable for studying near-field effects, whilst others are preferable for investigating far-field effects of the WEC farms. Furthermore, the analysis presented in this paper identifies areas in which the numerical modelling of WEC arrays is relatively weak and thus highlights those in which future developments are required.",,,,,"31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUL 01-06, 2012JUL 01-06, 2012","Petrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivPetrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL",19,0,0,0,0,0,19,,,,,978-0-7918-4494-6,,,,,,,,,"Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000324507000060,,

This poses a large number of challenges when dealing with model components with different resolutions and native scales. Differential equations and other 'classical methods' are well suited to the representation of large bodies or large areas, but often fail when fine scale detail is critical. In contrast, individual based models (IBMs) are well suited for fine scale questions but are inappropriate (typically due to computation demands) for representing all components of a regional system-level model. Bringing both of these model types together in one framework shows great promise not only for representing ecological systems, but for addressing management questions. Lessons learnt from such an exercise on the Ningaloo Reef system (Western Australia) highlights the pitfalls and potential of taking marine management to regional, multiple use and fully dynamic scales. In particular, the work highlights how failing to take such approach can compound a failure to appreciate tradeoffs in the system with the human tendency to underestimate the impact of cumulative non-linear impacts.Ningaloo-Exmouth region is an area of exceptional beauty and productivity that is supporting a diverse range of local activities (e. g. farming, fishing and oil and gas exploration), while also attracting national and international tourists. The proximity of Ningaloo reef to the coastline and the presence of Cape Range National Park in the same area mean that any development or growth of industries (including tourism) needs to be done with sustainability foremost in mind and with a minimum of unintended effects.Avoiding unintended consequences is particularly important given the vulnerability of the area to cumulative impacts and the implications for pressure on water resources in such an arid area. The greatest influences on coastal systems like those in the Ningaloo-Exmouth region are: climate change; eutrophication and associated nuisance algal blooms; habitat degradation and destruction; species extinctions and introductions; pollutants; changes in water cycles; disturbance of biogeochemical cycles and physical properties like temperature, salinity and pH. Individually, each of these pressures can pose serious management challenges, but in combination their cumulative impacts can rapidly degrade the state of a system.The new set of environmental conditions likely to be created in the Ningaloo-Exmouth region under global climate change (e. g. changes in weather patterns and oceanic water column properties like temperature and pH) are likely to impact the availability of water in the region and may also affect the resilience of the reef to other pressures. This makes any decision that may affect water or the reef of potential concern to the community, management bodies and every industry in the area. Regardless of what the final set of decision is, there will be tradeoffs between sectors and system components and potentially even between generations when addressing questions regardingthe use open or restricted access (by area or activity) for managing load on the system;the speed of infrastructure and coastal development; andthe relationship between environmental load, eco-efficient practices and technology, the sustainability of regional development and the carrying capacity of the area.Preliminary results show that due to the location, isolation and the distribution of resources in the region, just a few decisions separate a possible future where governance and development encourages growth and sustainable industries, and a possible future where the capacity of the system is exceeded, at great environmental, social and economic cost.",,,,,Combined IMACS World Congress/Modelling and Simulation Society-of-Australia-and-New-Zealand (MSSANZ)/18th Biennial Conference on Modelling and SimulationCombined IMACS World Congress/Modelling and Simulation Society-of-Australia-and-New-Zealand (MSSANZ)/18th Biennial Conference on Modelling and Simulation,"JUL 13-17, 2009JUL 13-17, 2009","IMACS; MSSANZ; CSIRO; Australian Math Sci Inst; Griffith Univ; eWater Cooperat Res Ctr; Dept Sustainabil & Environm; HEMA Consulting; Hellenic European Res Comp Math & Applicat; Int Council Ind Appl Math; Int Soc Grid Generat; Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing; Japan Soc Simulat Technol; Pacific Rim Math Assoc; Rutgers, State Univ New JerseyIMACS; MSSANZ; CSIRO; Australian Math Sci Inst; Griffith Univ; eWater Cooperat Res Ctr; Dept Sustainabil & Environm; HEMA Consulting; Hellenic European Res Comp Math & Applicat; Int Council Ind Appl Math; Int Soc Grid Generat; Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing; Japan Soc Simulat Technol; Pacific Rim Math Assoc; Rutgers, State Univ New Jersey","Cairns, AUSTRALIACairns, AUSTRALIA",5,0,0,0,4,0,5,,,,,978-0-9758400-7-8,,,,,,,,,"CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000290045002023,,

However, as the connection cost of a wave energy development is a driving factor in the development's feasibility, existing wind farm cable-routing techniques used by renewable energy developers may not be satisfactory. A Geographical Information System (GIS) method is presented which optimises the cable route between a wave farm and the electricity network, while taking a range of exclusion zones, such as native vegetation, into account. The optimisation is presented for a South Australian study area, which subsequently showed that exclusion zones reduce the number of suitable locations for wave energy by almost 40%. The method presented also assesses the effect that each exclusion zone applied has upon the number of suitable locations within the study area. The analysis undertaken showed that National Parks and cliffs pose a significant limitation to the potential of a wave energy industry within South Australia. Allowing the transmission route to travel through a National Park, or traverse a cliff, resulted in an increase in the number of locations from which a connection could be made to the electricity grid for less than $10 million of 33% and 50%, respectively. Conservation Parks, Wilderness Areas and native vegetation also have an effect upon the number of suitable locations for wave energy within South Australia. The GIS methods developed may be of assistance to governments in setting appropriate marine renewable energy policy, and also in identifying existing policy which may require amending if the government wishes to pursue and support the development of wave energy.

The EVOS began on March 24, 1989, and released 40.8 million liters of Alaska North Slope crude oil into the cold, nearly pristine environment of Prince William Sound, Alaska. EVOS oiled wildlife and rocky intertidal shorelines and exposed early life stages of fish to embryotoxic levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Long-term impacts following EVOS were observed on seabirds, sea otters, killer whales, and subtidal communities. The DWH spill began on April 20, 2010, and released 507 million liters of light Louisiana crude oil from 1600 m on the ocean floor into the Gulf of Mexico over an 87-day period. The DWH spill exposed a diversity of complex aquatic communities in the deep ocean, offshore pelagic areas, and coastal environments to petroleum hydrocarbons. Large-scale persistent ecological effects included impacts to deep ocean corals, failed recruitment of oysters over multiple years, damage to coastal wetlands, and reduced dolphin, sea turtle, and seabird populations. The HSOS began on December 7, 2007, and released approximately 13 million liters of Middle East crude oils into ecologically sensitive areas of the Taean area of western Korea. Environmental conditions and the extensive initial cleanup of HSOS oil stranded on shorelines limited the long-term impacts to changes in composition and abundance of intertidal benthic communities.

Understanding these impacts is crucial in view of the socioeconomic relevance of estuaries and their high sensitivity as the complex natural systems that they are. The objective' of this work is to investigate the impact of port expansion on estuarine dynamics through a case study. Process-based models are implemented to investigate the morphodynamic response of the estuary to the expansion of the Port of Ribadeo. The models simulate the hydrodynamics and sediment transport of the estuary with and without the port development. In total, 12 scenarios are considered: pre- and post-expansion cases; morphological timed of 1, 2 and 4 years; and two tidal energy situations (equinoctial and solstitial tides, i.e. high and low energy, respectively). The models are forced with the tide (prescribed through the nine major constituents) and river inflow, and the significant variation in sediment size over the estuary is accounted for. Excellent agreement (R > 0.95) is achieved between computed and observed water levels and flow velocities. Having validated the model, the cases pre- and post-expansion are simulated and compared to determine the effects of the port expansion project on estuarine dynamics. The project is found to result in a marked increase in sedimentation on the eastern bank, leading to the infilling of a channel that is vital to the operation of the Port of Figueras and, in particular, its shipyard. More generally, these results prove the capacity of port expansion projects to exert relevant nonlocal impacts on estuarine activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The trained model is applied using a greedy local search with a backtracking optimisation strategy. For evaluating the performance of the proposed approach, some of the more popular and successful Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are compared in four real wave scenarios (Sydney, Perth, Adelaide and Tasmania).

The goal of this work is to use heuristic search to optimise the power output of arrays in a size-constrained environment by configuring WEC locations and the power-take-off (PTO) settings for each WEC. Modelling the complex hydrodynamic interactions in wave farms is expensive, which constrains search to only a few thousand model evaluations. We explore a variety of heuristic approaches including cooperative and hybrid methods. The effectiveness of these approaches is assessed in two real wave scenarios (Sydney and Perth) with farms of two different scales. We find that a combination of symmetric local search with Nelder-Mead Simplex direct search combined with a back-tracking optimization strategy is able to outperform previously defined search techniques by up to 3%.",,,,,Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO)Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO),"JUL 13-17, 2019JUL 13-17, 2019","Assoc Comp Machinery; Assoc Comp Machinery, Special Interest Grp Genet & Evolutionary ComputatAssoc Comp Machinery; Assoc Comp Machinery, Special Interest Grp Genet & Evolutionary Computat","Prague, CZECH REPUBLICPrague, CZECH REPUBLIC",14,0,0,0,0,0,15,,,,,978-1-4503-6111-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ Adelaide, Sch Comp Sci, Optimizat & Logist Grp, Adelaide, SA, AustraliaUniv Adelaide, Sch Mech Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia",,,,2020-09-11,WOS:000523218400151,,

For this purpose, a high-resolution model of Ria de Ribadeo (NW Spain) is used to describe the potential effects resulting from the operation of two prospective tidal farms. Two different scenarios of extracted power from the flow (high and low) are analyzed. Overall, it is found that the impact on the water level is negligible, but that on the flow velocity is significant. The velocity is reduced upstream and downstream the farm, and increased beside it. These effects are enhanced in the scenario with the higher power extraction. Finally, these modifications in the flow pattern alter the available energy density at the tidal turbine, with a reduction of 21% and 12% for the high and low levels of power extraction, respectively.

The simulation of a shallow water wave farm applies alternative methods for implementing a frequency dependent absorption in both the BW and SW models, where energy extraction is based on experimental data from a scaled Oyster device. The effects of including wave diffraction within the SW model is tested by using diffraction smoothing steps and various directional wave conditions. The results of this study reveal important information on the models realms of validity that is heavily dependent on the incident sea state and the removal of diffraction for the SW model. This yields an increase in simulation accuracy for far-field disturbances when diffraction is entirely removed. This highlights specific conditions where the BW and SW model may thrive but also regions where reduced performance is observed.

Simulating and computing the complicated hydrodynamic interactions in wave farms can be computationally costly, which limits optimisation methods to using just a few thousand evaluations. For dealing with this expensive optimisation problem, an adaptive neuro-surrogate optimisation (ANSO) method is proposed that consists of a surrogate Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model trained with a very limited number of observations. This model is coupled with a fast meta-heuristic optimiser for adjusting the model's hyper-parameters. The trained model is applied using a greedy local search with a backtracking optimisation strategy. For evaluating the performance of the proposed approach, some of the more popular and successful Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are compared in four real wave scenarios (Sydney, Perth, Adelaide and Tasmania).

Preliminary studies of wave energy converters (WECs) indicate that few and low environmental impacts are expected.

This was achieved in this study through a dual-functional wave power plant for generation of wave-power electricity and protection against coastal erosion for sustainable coastal development. The dual-functional wave-power plant was formed by integrating oscillating-water-column (OWC) devices into a pile breakwater, with each pile being an OWC-pile equipped with a power take-off device. The power extraction efficiency and hydrodynamic characteristics of the dual-functional wave-power plant were measured in a wave flume under various wave conditions. An orifice was used at the top of the pneumatic chamber of each OWC-pile to simulate the power take-off device. To evaluate the performance of the power plant in wave power extraction and shore protection, the surface elevation and pressure inside the OWC chamber, as well as the scattered waves, were measured. It was found that comparing to a standalone OWC-pile device with an identical design and geometric characteristics, an OWC-pile in the dual -functional wave-power plant could achieve significantly larger power-extraction efficiency. Comparing to a pile breakwater with the same dimensions, the wave transmission and reflection of the dual-functional wave-power plant were both weaker, especially the wave reflection, which is beneficial for structure safety and shore protection.

Various tidal stream device models have been proposed and, if they are installed at chosen high tidal stream velocity sites, they may face extreme climatic, current, and wave load conditions. As they contain complex mechanical, electrical, control, and structural systems, reliability and survivability will be a challenge. Data on their reliability have been scarce, as only a few prototypes have been built and operated. However, reliability prediction of new devices could minimize risk in prototype work. A practicable tidal stream device reliability prediction method could assist the development of cost-effective and viable future options. The present study proposes such a method and derives system reliability models for four generic-design, horizontal-axis, tidal stream devices, all rated 1-2 MW. Historical reliability data from similarly rated wind turbines and other relevant marine databases were used to populate the devised reliability models. The work shows that tidal stream devices can expect to have a lower reliability than wind turbines of comparable size and that failure rates increase with complexity. The work also shows that with these predictions, few devices can expect to survive more than a year in the water. This suggests that either predicted failure rates must be reduced dramatically or that methods for raising reliability - by the use of twin axes or improving maintenance access by unmooring or the use of a seabed pile and turbine raising - will be needed to achieve better survivor rates. The purpose of this work is not to predict definitive individual device failure rates but to provide a comparison between the reliabilities of a number of different device concepts.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,0,13,,,1748-006X,1748-0078,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Durham, Sch Engn & Comp Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England",,,,2012-02-01,WOS:000300053300002,,

This paper presents a full life cycle assessment (LCA) of the first-generation Pelamis wave energy converter, aiming to contribute to the body of published studies and examine any potential trade-offs or co-benefits across a broad range of environmental impacts.MethodsThe process-based attributional LCA was carried out on the full cradle-to-grave life cycle of the Pelamis P1 wave energy converter, including the device, its moorings and sub-sea connecting cable up to the point of connection with the grid. The case study was for a typical wave farm located off the north-west coast of Scotland. Foreground data was mostly sourced from the manufacturer. Background inventory data was mostly sourced from the ecoinvent database (v3.3), and the ReCiPe and CED impact assessment methods were applied.Results and discussionThe Pelamis was found to have significantly lower environmental impacts than conventional fossil generation in 6 impact categories, but performed worse than most other types of generation in 8 of the remaining 13 categories studied. The greatest impacts were from steel manufacture and sea vessel operations. The device performs quite well in the two most frequently assessed impacts for renewable energy converters: climate change and cumulative energy demand. The carbon payback period is estimated to be around 24months (depending on the emissions intensity of the displaced generation mix), and the energy return on investment is 7.5. The contrast between this and the poor performance in other impact categories demonstrates the limitations of focussing only on carbon and energy.ConclusionsThe Pelamis was found to generally have relatively high environmental impacts across many impact categories when compared to other types of power generation; however, these are mostly attributable to the current reliance on fossil fuels in the global economy and the early development stage of the technology. Opportunities to reduce this also lie in reducing requirements for steel in the device structure, and decreasing the requirements for sea vessel operations during installation, maintenance and decommissioning.",,,,,,,,,30,1,0,0,2,0,34,,,0948-3349,1614-7502,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Edinburgh, Inst Energy Syst, Sch Engn, Edinburgh EH9 3DW, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2019-02-19,WOS:000457748700006,30872902,

However, the use of large areas of the sea for wind farms can impact on marine ecosystems and on the many species that depend on these ecosystems, from sandeels to seabirds, and the important services these ecosystems provide, such as fisheries and recreation. As a result, many stakeholders might be affected by new wind farms, including commercial, government, nature conservation and community interests. Depending on where wind farms are located, different trade-offs between these benefits will need to be made. Ecological researchers have developed oceanographic models that can predict how the addition of 100s of large gravity based windmills will change the movement and accumulation patterns of bottom sediment and in what locations there will be hydrographic changes sufficient to affect the amount of plankton (the base of the marine food chain) produced. From previous research, we can predict the consequential changes in the distributions of sandeels, seabirds and marine mammals.Economists and social scientists have developed ways of assimilating ecological evidence to assess the ecosystem services impacts on stakeholders of large scale changes, such as in agricultural practices (Bateman et al. 2013 Science 341:45-50). Together they evaluate how changes in ecosystem services in terrestrial settings are viewed socially, culturally, economically and legally. However, in the marine environment, and because of the infancy of large offshore developments, marine renewable energy industries do not currently have an established or standardised process to evaluate the ecological, economic and cultural trade-offs inherent in alternative locations of offshore windfarms. This project brings together leading ecological, economic, social-cultural, and legal experts from the University of Aberdeen, the Scottish Association for Marine Science, the James Hutton Institute and Marine Scotland Science with 3 marine renewable energy companies; Seagreen, Repsol & MainStream RP. Together, this group will co-develop a decision-support system to assess large scale changes in ecosystem services in the marine environment. Using a case study of the wider Firth of Forth, Scotland, where there are plans for a Marine Protected Area in the same location as the windfarms, these partners will bring together a wide range of stakeholders (fishing industry, marine wildlife NGOs, local community leaders and environmental businesses) to map out different types of evidence, discuss their different and shared values and evaluate different spatial wind farm scenarios to inform decisions. At the core of the projects there will be 2 workshops; the first of which uses the rich amount of existing data for this area to develop a common understanding of the social-ecological system. The 2nd will explore ecosystem service trade-offs under different wind turbine configuration scenarios. This project will facilitate the rare opportunity of providing the interaction needed to enhance business's and stakeholder's understanding of ecosystem services in the context of a real situation at just the right time for immediate implementation.The CORPORATES project will produce a user's guide on how to run this process, so that it can become a standardised tool for the industry. This can bring substantial benefits to industry, as business plans can be better aligned to different stakeholder interests and communal values, increasing support for plans, reducing the risk of conflict and improving the reputation of the company. The project will also help businesses take better account and understanding of the value of the many services that ecosystems provide us and the benefits they bring to human wellbeing, leading to more sustainable use of the marine environment.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/M000184/1,,,,,,,,University of Aberdeen,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15403354,,

On this basis, finding viable locations for combined offshore renewable energies is fundamental to boosting their development.

The diurnal variation of the bottom soil temperature in the tidal zone was strongly controlled by the tidal cycle. Especially the set-up time of the exposition plays an important role in the botton soil heating and the energy and CO2 transfer into the atmosphere.(3)Numerical methods for analyzing the form of tidelands and their gullies were developed. Quasi-three dimensional ocean circulation model POM and MEC were applied to the simulation of current and material transport in the Ariake Sea.(4)The sustainable method to recover the tidal flat polluted by the reductive matters were developed, due to leaching out and oxidizing the matters of the bottom soil with the oxygen rich sea water using tidal energy. Through batch test and column test in laboratory and in field column test, the ratio of COD reduction due to leaching and oxidizing of the bottom soil in column tests.(5)Sulfur cycling by sulfate metabolizing bacteria such as Allochromatium and Thiobacillus, which can grow both in anaerobic and aerobic conditions, is the main metabolism in a tidal flat. After plowing the tidal flat, it is shown that aerobic bacteria become major microorganisms instead of sulfate metabolizing bacteria in clone analysis with 16S rDNA and number of Thiobaeillus-like bacteria increase in the analysis with nirS gene.(6)This study clarified the environmental changes based on analyses of many core samples, pollen/diatom, and radiocarbon dating in late Pleistocene to Holocene of Kumamoto Plain and the southeastern part of Ariake Bay. Also analysis of diatom from the bottom sediments and the surface seawater suggested that an eutrophic condition of water in Ariake Bay started at 160-30 years ago in each area. We made clear the distribution patterns of the surface sediments and water masses in Ariake and Yatsushiro Seas, and published these characteristics as 2 sets of database.(7)Prevention of pollution of the land level side is important for environmental reproduction of Ariake Sea / Yatsushiro Sea.

Environmental loads are modelled for a braced monopile structure supporting both a wind and tidal turbine, as well as for each system in isolation. Peak loading of the combined system is found to be driven by wind loads with greatest overturning moment occurring with the wind turbine operating at close to rated-speed and the tidal turbine close to its shutdown speed. Mean loads vary across the tidal array by 6% indicating no significant shielding effects are gained by co-locating in more sheltered regions of the array. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

However, the ecological impacts which may result when large arrays of these devices are deployed are unknown. This uncertainty is placing a considerable burden on developers who must collect biological data through baseline and post-deployment monitoring programs under the Environmental Impact Assessment process. Regulators and other stakeholders are often particularly concerned about impacts on marine vertebrates (fish, seabirds and mammals) because many of these receptors are of high conservation and public concern. Unfortunately monitoring for most marine vertebrates is challenging and expensive, especially in the energetic waters where tidal-stream MREDs will be deployed. Surveys for marine vertebrates often have low statistical power and so are likely to fail to detect all but substantial changes in abundance. Furthermore, many marine vertebrate species have large geographical ranges so that even if local changes in abundance are detected, they cannot usually be related to the wider populations. Much of the monitoring currently being undertaken at tidal-stream MRED development sites is thus leading to a 'data-rich but information-poor' (DRIP) situation. Such an approach adds to development costs whilst contributing little to wider ecosystembased understanding.

First, the harsh marine environment requires more frequent tasks relative to onshore wind turbines; and second, these labours can be delayed by difficult sea conditions - in particular, large wave heights - leading to down time and, consequently, increased costs. This can be offset in part by combining offshore wind and wave energy systems: wave energy converters adequately deployed extract part of the incoming wave energy, resulting in a milder wave climate within the wind park, and hence better accessibility for maintenance tasks and reduced down time. The actual results depend on the layout of the co-located wave-wind energy farm. Previous works showed that peripherally distributed arrays, i.e., co-located wave energy converters deployed along the periphery of the wind farm to act as a barrier, bring about good results in terms of wave height reduction and average accessibility. However, important differences between the accessibility to the wind turbines located directly behind the barrier and the other turbines in the farm were found. On this basis, the objective of this paper is to analyse whether non-uniformly distributed arrays can lead to a more uniform wave height reduction throughout the farm. The analysis is based on 4 offshore wind farms currently in operation: Alpha Ventus, Bard 1, Horns Rev 1 and Lincs. It was found that non-uniformly distributed arrays lead to a more significant average wave height reduction (by over 4.7%) and more uniformly distributed throughout the farm, as well as a greater power output from the co-located devices (by up to 16.5%).

Over the next few years the first arrays of multiple tidal stream turbines will be deployed mostly in UK, French and Canadian waters. The potential environmental effects should first be examined, in order to scale and site them appropriately. Large theoretical arrays of tidal stream turbines were designed for Scottish Waters (UK), to quantify the available power and the ocean response to its extraction. A comprehensive assessment of the tidal energy resource realistically available for electricity generation and the study of the potential environmental impacts associated with its extraction in Scottish Waters, can then lead the way to further development in different countries with potential tidal stream energy sources.In order to examine both local (< 100 km) and region-wide (> 100 km) spatial scales, the Scottish Shelf Model, an unstructured grid three-dimensional FVCOM (Finite Volume Community Ocean Model) implementation, is a useful tool, since it covers the entire NW European Shelf, but with a high resolution where the tidal stream energy is extracted. The arrays of tidal stream turbines were implemented in the model using the momentum sink approach, in which a momentum sink term represents the loss of momentum due to tidal energy extraction. A typical annual cycle of the NW European Shelf hydrodynamics was reproduced by the SSM model and compared with the same period perturbed by tidal stream energy extraction.The power extracted by the tidal stream arrays was estimated, taking into account the tidal stream energy extraction feedbacks on the flow and considering the realistic operation of a generic tidal stream turbine, which is limited to operate in a range of flow velocities due to technological constraints. The ocean response to tidal stream power extraction was then analysed at the temporal scale of a spring-neap tidal cycle and, for the first time, on longer term seasonal timescales. It is shown that the very large tidal stream arrays can introduce detectable changes to the tidal elevation, marine currents and ocean stratification patterns. Tidal elevation mainly increases upstream of the tidal farms locations (considering the direction of propagation of the tidal wave), while a decrease in the mean spring tidal range is observed downstream, along the UK East Coast and also in the Irish Sea. Marine currents, both tidal and residual flows, are also affected. They can slow down due to the turbines' action or speed up due to flow diversion and blockage processes, on both a local and regional scale. The strongest signal in tidal velocities is an overall reduction, which can in turn decrease the energy of tidal mixing and perturb the seasonal stratification on the NW European Shelf. Although the strength of summer stratification has been found to slightly increase, the extent of the stratified region does not greatly change, thus suggesting the enhanced biological and pelagic biodiversity hotspots, e.g. tidal mixing front locations, are not displaced. Such large-scale tidal stream energy extraction is unlikely to occur in the near future, since very large numbers of devices are required, but such potential changes should be considered when planning future tidal energy exploitation. It is likely that large scale developments around the NW European shelf will interact and could, for example, intensify or weaken the changes predicted here, or even be used as mitigation measures (e.g. coastal defence) for other changes, e.g. effects of climate change.",,,,,Oceans Aberdeen ConferenceOceans Aberdeen Conference,"JUN 19-22, 2017JUN 19-22, 2017",,"Aberdeen, ENGLANDAberdeen, ENGLAND",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-5090-5278-3,,,,,,,,,"Natl Oceanog Ctr, Liverpool, Merseyside, EnglandMarine Scotland Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000426997002088,,

It is time to study the environmental effects of much larger full-size arrays, to scale and site them appropriately. A theoretical array of tidal stream turbines was designed for the Pentland Firth (UK), a strait between Scotland and the Orkney Islands, which has very fast tidal currents. The practical power resource of a large array spanning the Pentland Firth was estimated to be 1.64 GW on average. The ocean response to this amount of energy extraction was simulated by an unstructured grid three-dimensional FVCOM (Finite Volume Community Ocean Model) and analysed on both short-term and seasonal timescales. Tidal elevation mainly increases upstream of the tidal array, while a decrease is observed downstream, along the UK east coast. Tidal and residual flows are also affected: they can slow down due to the turbines action or speed up due to flow diversion and blockage processes, on both a local and regional scale. The strongest signal in tidal velocities is an overall reduction, which can in turn decrease the energy of tidal mixing and perturb the seasonal stratification on the NW European Shelf.

The standard divides resource assessments into two different classes: feasibility and layout design. The model setup procedure (mesh resolution, boundary conditions) and the computational effort required vary significantly from one class to another. For these reasons, the objective of the present work is to explore the proposed standard using the Orkney Region (N Scotland) as a case study.

Marine sediment transport is forced by. both wave and tidal currents. Past work on tidal stream turbine impacts has largely ignored the contribution of waves. Here, a fully coupled hydrodynamic, spectral wave and sediment transport model is used to assess the importance of including waves in simulations of turbine impact on seabed morphodynamics. Assessment of this is important due to the additional expense of including waves in simulations. Focus is given to a sandbank in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth. It is found that inclusion of wave action alters hydrodynamics, although extent of alteration is dependant of wave direction. Magnitude of sediment transport is increased when waves are included in the simulations and this has implications for morphological and volumetric changes. Volumetric changes are substantially increased when wave action is included: the impact of including waves is greater than the impact of including tidal stream turbines. Therefore it is recommended that at tidal turbine array sites exposed to large swell or wind-seas, waves should be considered for inclusion in simulations of physical impact. (C) 2018 The Authors.

However, the ecological impacts upon marine top-predators, including seabirds, remain largely unknown. Although tidal stream turbines could have many direct and indirect impacts upon seabird populations, it is the risk of direct collisions between individuals and moving components that currently causes the most concern. Species such as Auks Alcidae sp., Cormorants Phalacrocorax sp. and Divers Gavia sp. almost certainly face higher risks than others. However, it is likely that they are not equally vulnerable. Part of predicting which are most vulnerable involves the estimation of spatial overlap between their foraging distributions and the location of tidal stream turbines. This paper reviews potential methods and approaches that should help to predict whether a population would: (1) exploit areas suitable for tidal stream turbines, (2) dive near tidal stream turbines within these areas, or (3) dive to depths where moving components are found? Answering these questions in a hierarchical manner (from 1 to 3) could help to predict the extent of spatial overlap for vulnerable populations. These approaches require a fundamental understanding of the mechanistic links between physical conditions, prey characteristics and foraging opportunities. Therefore, multi-disciplinary approaches incorporating methods usually associated with oceanographic and fisheries studies are needed to document physical conditions and prey characteristics over large and small spatial scales. Answering these questions also requires collaborative efforts and a strategic governance, approach to collating the wide range of distributional, prey and physical datasets currently being collected.

This was addressed in an essentially physical manner. Today, concerns are no longer limited to safety; lifestyle and quality of life have become essential components in the successful construction of coastal infrastructure. Other aspects of development have also become important, such as environmental impact, attractiveness and sustainability. New social realities must be addressed, as must the voices of actors and interest groups. The synthesis of recent concerns over coastal public works projects has become increasingly difficult due to new assumptions of value, social acceptance and the sustainability of these projects. In this context, it is now common knowledge that decision making on a coastal issue should be based on multiple criteria, including technical effectiveness, costs, benefits, implementation and monitoring. Here, coastal issues are reviewed using the dual perspective of meeting current needs and ensuring future sustainability. It is shown that multifunctional facilities built near the coast are one viable solution for managing coastal erosion. The results of a case study conducted in a sensitive area of the Portuguese coast are also presented. Based on an exhaustive review of the literature, it is also shown that improving nautical sports and generating renewable energy should not be neglected. Finally, contemporary adaptation measures and future accommodation options are recommended. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Such energy extraction will alter the hydrodynamics of a tidal region, analogous to increasing the bed friction in the region of extraction. In addition, this study demonstrates that energy extracted with respect to tidal asymmetries due to interactions between quarter (M-4) and semi-cliurnal (M-2) currents will have important implications for large-scale sediment dynamics. Model simulations show that energy extracted from regions of strong tidal asymmetry will have a much more pronounced effect on sediment dynamics than energy extracted from regions of tidal symmetry. The results show that energy extracted from regions of strong tidal asymmetry led to a 20% increase in the magnitude of bed level change averaged over the length of a large estuarine system, compared with energy extracted from regions of tidal symmetry. However, regardless of the location of a tidal stream farm within a tidal system, energy extraction reduces the overall magnitude of bed level change in comparison with non-extraction cases. This has practical application to many areas surrounding the UK, including the Irish Sea and the Bristol Channel, that exhibit strong tidal currents suitable for exploitation of the tidal stream resource, but where large variations in tidal asymmetry occur.

In this study, we explored the use of a new method aimed at tidal-stream habitats, which are of increasing interest for marine renewable energy generation. Porpoise detectors (C-PODs) were attached to multiple drifters and repeatedly set adrift at a tidal-stream site in western Scotland during May 2010 and August 2011. Porpoise vocalisations were successfully detected under varying tidal conditions during approximately 63 h of drifting. Harbour porpoise distribution, as determined by the drifting detectors, was similar to that found using the traditional, yet more logistically intensive, visual and acoustic boat-based surveys and to an extent that found by moored C-PODs. Drifting detectors also mapped tidally driven spatiotemporal variability in ambient noise levels which could influence porpoise detection.

Considering factors such as the distribution of tidal stream energy, bathymetry, topography, and the design parameters of the turbines, an appropriate location for a demonstration tidal turbine was selected and the corresponding energy resource was evaluated. Several sites with strong tidal streams were considered: south of the northern cape, east of the southern cape, and the southern end of Haitan Bay. The former was thought most suitable for the deployment of a tidal energy turbine, with projected power generation for approximately 470 h per month. The average power of this demonstration was about 2.4 kW, and the annual electricity output was approximately 17.47 MWh. The intervention of the turbine device had little influence on the near-field tidal stream or water level. The tidal stream was reduced slightly in the area south of the northern cape, although the effect weakened further from the turbine. Conversely, the velocity increased slightly on both sides of the demonstration site. The difference in current speed with and without the turbine was greater at slack tide than still tide. The influence of turbine operation on water level was minor. The method adopted in this study can be considered a reference for the selection of sites for the demonstration of tidal stream energy. However, the method is unable describe the dynamic characteristics of the turbulent flow surrounding the deployed turbines, which has an important role regarding the optimal designs of the turbine blade and pile foundations.

Simulations indicate that the power extracted by the tidal fence is limited because the flow will bypass the fence, predominantly on the ocean side, as the thrust applied by the devices increases. For the dynamic conditions, fence placements and headland aspect ratios considered, the maximum power extracted at the fence is not related in any obvious way to the local undisturbed kinetic flux or the natural rate of energy dissipation due to bed friction (although both of these have been used in the past to predict the amount of power that may be extracted). The available power (equal to the extracted power net of vertical mixing losses in the immediate wake of devices) is optimized for devices with large area and small centre-to-centre spacing within the fence.

Within Scotland, UK, the vulnerability of black guillemots Cepphus grylle and European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis is dependent on their tendency to exploit microhabitats characterised by fast mean horizontal current speeds 2 ms(-1)), and tidal states with maximum current speeds, within tidal stream environments. Identifying consistencies in their relative use of different microhabitats (fast versus slow mean horizontal current speeds) and tidal states (increasing/decreasing versus maximum currents) across these habitats could assist risk assessment and mitigation measures at both a regional and development site level. Datasets from shore-based surveys collated across 6 tidal stream environments showed that the probability of detecting foraging black guillemots and European shags tended to be higher in fast and slow microhabitats, respectively. However, differences between microhabitats were reversed and/or marginal in 3 out of the 5 sites used for each species. Differences between tidal states were almost always marginal.

The Pentland Firth is arguably the premier tidal stream site in the world and engineering developments are progressing rapidly. Therefore understanding and minimising impacts is vital to ensure the successful development of this nascent industry. Here a 3 dimensional coupled hydrodynamic and sediment transport numerical model is used to investigate the impact on sediment transport and morphodynamics of tidal stream arrays. The aim of the work presented here is twofold: firstly to provide prediction of the changes caused by multiple tidal stream turbine array developments to some of the unique sandy seabed environments in the Pentland Firth and secondly as a case study to determine the relationship between impacts of individual tidal stream farms and cumulative impacts of multiple farms. Due to connectivity in tidal flow it has been hypothesized that the cumulative impact of multiple arrays on sediment dynamics might be non-linear. This work suggests that, for the Pentland Firth, this is not the case: the cumulative impact of the 4 currently proposed arrays in the area is equal to the sum of the impacts of the individual arrays. Additionally, array implementation only has minimal effect on the baseline morphodynamics of the large sandbanks in the region, smaller more local sandbanks were not considered. These two results are extremely positive for tidal stream developers in the region since it removes the burden of assessing cumulative impact from individual developers and suggests that impacts to sub-sea morphodynamics is insignificant and hence is unlikely to be an impediment to development in the Pentland Firth with the currently proposed levels of extraction.

However, since suitable tidal stream sites are located in relatively shallow waters of the continental shelf where tidal currents are enhanced, tidal energy converters may experience effects of wind-generated surface-gravity waves. Waves may thus influencetidal currents, and associated kinetic energy, through two non-linear processes: the interaction of wave and current bottom boundary layers, and the generation of wave-induced currents. Here, we develop a three-dimensional tidal circulation model coupled with a phase-averaged wave model to quantify the impact of the waves on the tidal kinetic energy resource of the Fromveur Strait (western Brittany)- a region that has been identified with strong potential for tidal array development. Numerical results are compared with in situ observations of wave parameters (significant wave height, peak period and mean wave direction) and current amplitude and direction 10 m above the seabed (the assumed technology hub height for this region). The introduction of waves is found to improve predictions of tidal stream power at 10 m above the seabed at the measurement site in the Strait, reducing kinetic energy by up to 9% during storm conditions. Synoptic effects of wave radiation stresses and enhanced bottom friction are more specifically identified at the scale of the Strait. Waves contribute to a slight increase in the spatial gradient of available mean tidal stream potential between the north-western area and the south-eastern part of the Strait. At the scale of the region within the Strait that has been identified for tidal stream array development, the available mean spring tidal stream potential is furthermore reduced by 12% during extreme waves conditions. Isolated effects of wave radiation stresses and enhanced bottom friction lead to a reduction in spring tidal potential of 7.8% and 5.3%, respectively. It is therefore suggested that models used for tidal resource assessment consider the effect of waves in appropriately wave-exposed regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Tidal stream turbines are represented in the model using a momentum sink in order to (1) find an upper bound estimate of the available resource, (2) explore alternative, more realistic scenarios, and (3) estimate their effect on the physical environment. The maximum extractable power scenario (M-2 + S-2 cycle mean of 5.3 GW) requires a high density of turbines deployed through the channels cross section and has a major impact on the physical environment. More realistic scenarios, with the placement of the turbines constrained by practical factors, resulted in considerably less extractable power but the physical environmental impact was disproportionately reduced. It was also found that a variable thrust coefficient can be used to optimise the performance of tidal arrays. Our work highlights the usefulness of 3D hydrodynamic models for tidal stream resource assessment and impact studies, and illustrates how the design of tidal stream arrays can affect the levels of sustainably harnessed tidal power.

Although the strait is 105 km wide, mackerel migratory activity, as revealed by fisheries acoustics techniques and trawl catches, is concentrated in the first 6 km of nearshore waters on the southern side of the strait. Current-meters moored 2 km off the southern shore showed that tidal currents alternately enter and leave the Gulf with speeds up to 75 cm s(-1) while current-meters moored at 6 and 11 km offshore measured surface currents leaving the Gulf throughout the tidal cycle. The largest mean (1.2 kg m(-2)) and maximum (16.3 kg m(-2)) mackerel densities (from 11-80 m deep) were observed at slack tide. Mackerel densities increased at slack tides at the transition from a how leaving to a flow entering the Gulf whereas they decreased at slack tides at the transition from a flow entering to a flow leaving the Gulf. Because times of slack waters were irregular, mackerel density increases did not occur on a regular semi-diurnal basis. These results suggest that mackerel use selective tidal stream transport to enter the Gulf of SI Lawrence, although we were not able to document the vertical migrations through which selective tidal stream transport would be accomplished. This is the first report suggesting selective tidal stream transport in fast-swimming pelagic teleosts.

Marine renewables, including tidal stream power show great potential, however the economics of these technologies is currently less favourable than land based renewable energy technologies due to the challenge of worldng in the marine environment. A tidal stream turbine is being developed which will allow the extraction of energy from sites at which the flow speed is slower than those currently considered to be suitable for development, allowing the economic extraction of energy from a greater proportion of the tidal stream resource. The proposed system uses the boundary layer control techniques commonly found in the high-lift systems of aircraft to increase the lift force acting on the turbine blades in slow moving currents. In order to aid the design of the system an analytical model of the turbine is being developed. Previously, vertical axis tidal turbines have been designed with the aid of analytical models developed for the Darrieus wind turbine. A variety of models have been proposed for the Darrieus turbine, most of which are capable of giving good predictions of time averaged quantities, such as the power coefficient. Even the most advanced of these models, however, cannot predict with a high level of accuracy the instantaneous forces acting on the turbine blades.

While tidal stream turbines are being developed at a high rate and getting closer to commercialisation, it is important to acquire the right tools to assist planners and environmentalists, not only in finding a right location for the turbines, but also in identifying their potential impacts on the surrounding marine and coastal environment.In this study, a widely used open source depth integrated 2D hydro-environmental model, namely DIVAST, was modified to simulate the hydro-environmental impacts of the turbines in the coastal environment. The model predictions showed very good agreement with previously published 1D model results. Then, for demonstration purposes, the model was applied to an arbitrary array of tidal stream turbines in the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel which has the third highest tidal range in the world. The model has shown promising potential in investigating the impacts of the array on water levels, tidal currents and sediment and faecal bacteria levels as well as the generated tidal power, which facilitates investigating the relative far-field impacts of the arrays under various climate change scenarios or different formations of the array.

The objective of this study is to assess the impacts caused by the operation of a tidal farm on the transient and residual flow by means of a case study: a tidal stream farm in Ria de Ribadeo, an estuary in NW Spain. For this purpose a 3D numerical model of the estuary is implemented and successfully validated based on field data of tidal levels and flow velocities. The energy extracted by the tidal stream farm from the flow is accounted for by adding a momentum sink term in the equations of the model. Two scenarios representative of typical winter and summer conditions are considered. The results show that the disturbances to the transient flow patterns are concentrated in the proximity of the farm, with a weakening of the flow upstream and, especially, downstream of the farm (up to 0.25 ms(-1)) and an intensification on both sides (up to 0.10 ms(-1)). As for the residual flow, we find that the operation of the tidal farm does not disrupt the complex 3D residual circulation of the ria, but it does lead to modifications of the residual flow of up to 0.025 ms(-1), or approximately 10% of the baseline residual flow, which affect a much larger area than in the case of the transient flow (up to approximately 2 km from the farm). The repercussions of these alterations of the transient and residual flow patterns of the estuary for its sedimentary and biological processes warrant further research. Overall, these results confirm the importance of assessing the impacts of a tidal stream farm on the flow. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Settling larvae consisted primarily of stages G through I-1. These stages correspond to the metamorphosing period and showed behaviour related to selective tidal-stream transport, occurring on and near the bottom during the daytime and ascending at night, especially on flood tides, enabling migration to inshore and estuarine nursery habitats. This diel vertical migration is also considered to play an important role in avoiding predation by diurnal piscivorous fishes and nocturnal benthic sand shrimp. Settling flounder were abundant in deeper waters in February, and with inshore movement, densities peaked in late March in estuaries.

An understanding of their spatial and temporal occupancy of these habitats at a regional-scale will help steer installations towards locations which maximize energy returns but reduce the potential for interactions with populations. This study quantifies and compares relationships between the presence of harbour porpoise and several hydrodynamic characteristics across four tidal stream environments in Anglesey, UK-a region that has been earmarked for extensive industrial development. Within sites (0.57-1.13 km(2)), encounters with animals were concentrated in small areas (<200 m(2)) and increased during certain tidal states (ebb vs. flood). In sites showing relatively high maximum current speeds (2.67-2.87 ms(-1)), encounters were strongly associated with the emergence of shear-lines. In sites with relatively low maximum current speeds (1.70-2.08 ms(-1)), encounters were more associated with areas of shallow water during peak current speeds. The overall probability of encounters was higher in low current sites. It is suggested that the likelihood of interactions could be reduced by restricting developments to sites with high maximum current speeds (>2.5 ms(-1)), and placing turbines in areas of laminar currents therein. This study shows that a combination of local and regional hydrodynamic characteristics can partially explain variations in occupancy patterns across tidal-stream environments. However, it was found that such hydrodynamic characteristics could not comprehensively explain these occupancy patterns.

Herring released near the south shore travelled upriver near the shore while herring released near an island where significant spawning occurs remained in the vicinity of that island. Herring near the shore moved upriver regardless of the tidal phase while herring close to the island swam actively against tidal currents during both phases of the tide. Herring near the coast may have been migrating to an alternate spawning site further upriver while herring near the island remained in close proximity to the island's spawning site as a result of their behaviour. Herring travelling near the coast seemed to take advantage of tidal currents by swimming with tidal streams when the tide flowed in the migratory direction (flood tide) and by swimming against them when the tide flowed counter to it (ebb tide).

In this research, a high resolution coupled wave-tide model of a proposed tidal stream array has been developed. We investigated the effect of WCI processes on the tidal resource of the site for typical dominant wave scenarios of the region. We have implemented a simplified method to include the effect of waves on bottom friction. The results show that as a consequence of the combined effects of the wave radiation stresses and enhanced bottom friction, the tidal energy resource can be reduced by up to 20% and 15%, for extreme and mean winter wave scenarios, respectively. Whilst this study assessed the impact for a site relatively exposed to waves, the magnitude of this effect is variable depending on the wave climate of a region, and is expected to be different, particularly, in sites which are more exposed to waves. Such effects can be investigated in detail in future studies using a similar procedure to that presented here. It was also shown that the wind generated currents due to wind shear stress can alter the distribution of this effect. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We quantified N retention in Kimages Creek, VA, following a dam breach that restored its historical (pre-1920) connection to the James River Estuary. Estimates of N retention derived from mass balance analysis were compared to tracer-based retention estimates obtained by injecting NH4Cl during an incoming tide and measuring recovery on the outgoing tide. The injection experiments showed that dissolved inorganic N (DIN) retention in the restored tidal and nontidal segments was similar to nearby streams and previously published values. These data suggest that the stream has attained expected levels of functioning less than 2 yr after restoration despite 80 yr of impoundment. The mass balance analysis provided additional information for restoration assessment as this approach allowed us to track multiple N fractions. These results showed that DIN retention was offset by export of total organic N resulting in net loss of total N from the restored creek.

Tidal stream technology is developing rapidly, with the market leaders moving away from a pre-commercial demonstrator stage towards full-scale array deployment. Learning from the more established wind energy sector, developers have generally favoured horizontal axis designs, as these traditionally offer higher peak efficiencies when compared to their vertical axis counterparts. However, valid arguments have been raised that suggest a vertical axis device would be more suited to a tidal regime, particularly since it has omnidirectional characteristics and can operate in shallow waters. In this study, the wake characteristics of a vertical axis tidal stream turbine were investigated, using both physical and numerical modelling techniques. Due to the unsteady nature of a vertical axis device, previous techniques such as the porous disk approach were unsuitable to model the turbine behaviour. Consequently, a number of scaled turbines have been constructed for this series of experiments. Testing was carried out in the 17m recirculating flume at the Hydro-environmental Research Centre's hydraulics laboratory, at Cardiff University. The numerical model CFX was used for this study, and mesh motion techniques were employed to replicate the dynamic behaviour of the turbines in a like for like model of the flume. Two turbine sizes were used to vary the blockage in the flume. The findings showed that the time-averaged wake was 90% recovered between 10-15 diameters downstream of the turbine, which was comparable to a horizontal axis device. The shape of the wake structure was unsymmetrical, however, the unsteady nature of the flow due to vortex shedding as the turbine rotated suggested that turbines could be spaced closer together. The numerical model results showed good agreement with the obtained laboratory data, highlighting the applicability of using this methodology to assess the impact of such devices.",,,,,35th World Congress of the International-Association-for-Hydro-Environment-Engineering-and-Research (IAHR)35th World Congress of the International-Association-for-Hydro-Environment-Engineering-and-Research (IAHR),"SEP 08-13, 2013SEP 08-13, 2013",Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & ResInt Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res,"Chengdu, PEOPLES R CHINAChengdu, PEOPLES R CHINA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-7-302-33544-3,,,,,,,,,"Cardiff Univ, Sch Engn, Cardiff CF24 3AA, S Glam, Wales",,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000343761501093,,

For larvae moving from the shelf to estuarine habitats, selective tidal stream transport proposes that larvae are higher in the water column during flood tide and lower in the water column during ebb tide. Although a number of studies conclude that selective tidal stream transport is the mechanism responsible for larval ingress, few studies consider alternative mechanisms or consider passive explanations for tidal patterns in larval distributions. We examined the biophysical mechanisms responsible for larval ingress into Chesapeake Bay using an Eulerian approach. We made flux calculations for 3 species and partitioned flux estimates among 3 different ingress mechanisms (wind forcing, residual bottom inflow and tidal). For the Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus (Sciaenidae), all 3 mechanisms of ingress contributed to the net up-estuary flux of larvae, but tidal mechanisms become more important for larger sizes. Net up-estuary flux of the Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus (Clupeidae) was dominated by residual bottom inflow and wind forcing. Ingress of the summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus (Para-lichthyidae) was dominated by tidal mechanisms, and the importance of tides increased with developmental stage. We found little evidence for the hypothesis that tidal patterns in larval distributions resulted from passive processes (water mass-specific distributions, buoyancy, vertical mixing), thereby supporting the hypothesis that tidal patterns resulted from active behaviors. However, our estimates of vertical mixing were not direct and additional work is needed to examine the role of vertical mixing in influencing vertical distributions in areas with strong tides. We conclude that a combination of wind forcing, residual bottom inflow, and selective tidal stream transport are responsible for the ingress of larval fishes into Chesapeake Bay, and that the relative importance of the 3 mechanisms differs among species and changes with larval development.",,,,,,,,,51,1,0,0,42,0,68,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NCCOS, Ctr Coastal Fisheries & Habitat Res, Beaufort, NC 28516 USAOld Dominion Univ, Ctr Quantitat Fisheries Ecol, Norfolk, VA 23529 USAOld Dominion Univ, Ctr Coastal Phys Oceanog, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000234214500024,,

The key issues which drive the cost are the time required to conduct operations and susceptibility to weather risk coupled with the expense of marine assets.Current vessels have limited operational windows due to weather and tidal constraints, which result in considerable cumulative costs due to high charges for such vessels. The marine renewable industry is currently reliant on vessels of opportunity from the offshore oil and gas sector; which, while sufficient for single device demonstration deployments, are not viable for array installations. De-coupling the tidal sector from this market place offers the opportunity to reduce the volatility of vessel day rates.This paper presents the concept design of an efficient and economic, fit for purpose installation vessel for tidal stream energy converters.

Diel DO variability in these streams was driven by: (1) photosynthesis by aquatic plants and community respiration which produced DO maxima in the afternoon and minima early morning (range, 0.6-4.7 g/m(3)) as a product of the solar cycle and (2) tidal variability as a product of the lunar cycle, including saline intrusions with variable DO concentrations plus a small residual effect on freshwater DO for low-velocity streams. The lowest DO concentrations were observed during March (early autumn) when water temperatures and macrophyte biomass were high. Spatial comparisons indicated that low-gradient tidal streams were at greater risk of DO depletions harmful to aquatic life. Tidal influence was stronger in low-gradient streams, which typically drain more developed catchments, have lower reaeration potential and offer conditions more suitable for aquatic plant proliferation.

The hydrodynamic conditions of depth-limited tidal sites are highly influenced by changes in the bathymetric conditions, such as sedimentation and/or dredging operations, which are typical of these regions. Consequently, significant variations in terms of magnitude and predominant flow direction can be present during the operating life of tidal farms, which may compromise their viability. The objective of this work is to explore the potential effects caused by dredging operations on the performance of tidal farms and to propose initial threshold values for key variables (flow magnitude and direction, operating hours of TECs), to ensure the technoeconomic viability of tidal farms. For this purpose, three potential tidal sites in a shallow water estuary (Ribadeo, NW Spain), were used as case study. Significant variations were found between the preand post-dredging scenarios in terms of energy production, with annual variations exceeding 38%, for the tidal sites present in the region. In sum, the present study highlights the importance of considering the potential bathymetric changes in the decision-making process, when planning the installation of tidal farms in depth-limited regions.

Evidence suggests that these conditions benefit top predators such as harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena, presumably allowing them to optimise exploitation of prey resources. However, clear demonstration of this relationship is complicated by the fact that strong tidal flows often occur near-simultaneously across a wide area. The Great Race of the Gulf of Corryvreckan (western Scotland, UK) is a jetting tidal system where high-energy conditions persist across a broad range of tidal phases in a localised, moving patch of water. Porpoises can therefore actively enter or avoid this habitat, facilitating study of their usage of adjacent high-and low-energy environments. The distribution of harbour porpoises was studied using passive acoustic porpoise detectors (C-PODs) deployed on static moorings (similar to 35 d) and on Lagrangian drifters moving freely with the current (up to similar to 48 h). This dual approach provided complementary perspectives on porpoise presence. C-PODs moored in the path of the Great Race registered a significant increase in detections during the passing of the energetic tidal jet. Encounter durations recorded by drifting C-PODs were longer than those recorded by moored C-PODs, suggesting that porpoises tended to move downstream with the flow rather than remaining stationary relative to the seabed or moving upstream. The energetic, turbulent conditions of the Great Race are clearly attractive to porpoises, and they track its movement with time; however, their structured movements in response to the evolving tidal situation cannot simply be represented as a direct relationship between current speed and porpoise presence.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,16,0,24,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland",,,,2016-05-10,WOS:000376376200021,,

An alternative approach for simulating the turbine's array energy capture at a regional scale, momentum sink-TOC, is used to assess the impact of power extraction. The method computes a non-constant thrust force calculated based on the turbine's operating conditions, and it uses the wake induction factor and blockage ratio to characterise the performance of a turbine. Additionally, the momentum sink-TOC relates the changes produced by power extraction, on the velocity and sea surface within the turbine's near-field extension, to the turbine's thrust force. The method was implemented in two hydrodynamic models that solved gradually varying flows (GVF) and rapidly varying flows (RVF). The local hydrodynamic effects produced by tidal-stream power extraction for varying the turbine's operating conditions was investigated in (i) the thrust and power coefficient calculation, (ii) flow rate reduction, and (iii) tidal currents' velocity and elevation profiles. Finally, for a turbine array that operates at optimal conditions, the potential energy resource was assessed. The maximisation of power extraction for electrical generation requires the use of an optimum turbine wake induction factor and an adequate blockage ratio, so that the power loss due to turbine wake mixing is reduced. On the other hand, the situations where limiting values of these parameters are used should be avoided as they lead to negligible power available. In terms of hydrodynamical models, an RVF solver provided a more accurate evaluation of the turbine's operating conditions effect on local hydrodynamics. Particularly satisfactory results were obtained for a partial-fence. In the case of a fence configuration, the GVF solver was found to be a computationally economical tool to pre-assess the resource; however, caution should be taken as the solver did not accurately approximate the velocity decrease produced by energy extraction.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"NUI Galway, Coll Engn & Informat, Galway H91TK33, IrelandNUI Galway, Ryan Inst, Galway H91TK33, IrelandCtr Marine & Renewable Energy Ireland MaREI, Cork P43C573, Ireland",NUI GalwayNUI GalwayCtr Marine & Renewable Energy Ireland MaREI,,,2020-07-31,WOS:000550124100001,,

Furthermore, the tidal dissipation at potential TEC sites can produce high suspended sediment concentrations (turbidity maxima) which are important for biological productivity. Yet few impact assessments of potential TEC sites have looked closely at sediment dynamics beyond local scouring issues. It is therefore important to understand to what extent exploitation of the tidal energy resource will affect sedimentary processes, and the scale of this impact is here assessed in relation to natural variability. At one such site in the Irish Sea that is highly attractive for the deployment of TEC arrays, we collect measurements of sediment type and bathymetry, apply a high resolution unstructured morphodynamic model, and a spectral wave model in order to quantify natural variability due to tidal and wave conditions. We then simulate the impacts of tidal-stream energy extraction using the morphodynamic model. Our results suggest that the sedimentary impacts of 'first generation' TEC arrays (i.e. less than 50 MW), at this site, are within the bounds of natural variability and are, therefore, not considered detrimental to the local environment. Yet we highlight potential environmental issues and demonstrate how impact assessments at other sites could be investigated. (c) 2014 The Authors.

This paper investigates this interaction between energy extraction and tidal constituents, and also the effect that power extraction may have on harmonics of the principal constituents (i.e. compound tides and overtides). Firstly, the variation in power extraction and available power (defined as the fraction of extracted power removed by idealised tidal turbines) are investigated over a spring/neap tidal cycle using a simple theoretical model. Results from the model are used to derive analytical bounds to the variation in power at spring and neap tide. These bounds are shown to depend on the channels natural dynamic balance and are of practical importance to tidal stream device developers looking to supply power to the electricity grid. Secondly, changes in the higher harmonics in channel flow rate are investigated for deployments of tidal farm in channels of various length and geometry. Specifically, it is shown that in general if the turbines provide a uniform drag resistance to the flow through the channel, even harmonics in the flow rate will decay with power extraction (leading to a more symmetric tide), whilst odd harmonics in the flow rate may decay or increase depending on the natural tidal dynamics. These variations can have significant effect on residual flows and the local environment. Throughout the paper results from the theoretical model are compared with a complex numerical model of energy extraction from the Pentland Firth. Good agreement is shown in all cases.

All eels but one were released on the bottom after 1-22 h adaptation in a cage on the sea bed. Tidal currents were recorded continuously at two depths and two locations in the vicinity of tracking of 15 eels, and movements of eels through the water could be calculated by vector subtraction. The four yellow eels generally moved shoreward, while silver eels exhibited shoreward, offshoreward, or along-tide movements. Two silver eels used selective tidal stream transport to move northward, as evidenced by the close, match between over-ground distances and calculated tidal excursions on transporting tides, and by the higher positions in the water column on transporting tides. When in midwater, most eels exhibited periods of well oriented directional swimming, showing only modest variation in the directional component of calculated 15-min vectors of swimming through the water. At other times, directions of 15-min vectors were widely scattered, and the eels drifted with the tide. One of the eels using selective tidal stream transport swam in an apparently unoriented manner on four successive transporting tides, but another added well oriented swimming to transport by the tide. Eels in midwater swam at modest mean speeds of 35-58 cm s(-1) (0.45-0.75 L s(-1)). Eels were quite mobile vertically both on time scales of hours and of minutes. One clearly showed diel vertical migration, while two others showed the reverse pattern. Eels using selective tidal stream transport timed their vertical movements only imprecisely to times of tidal stream reversal. All 18 eels made contact with the sea bottom (ignoring the release at the bottom) and came near the sea surface during the tracks. Some eels spent most of the time near the surface with frequent descents. Only a few spent much time on or near the bottom; and they made frequent ascents. Some remained mostly in midwater but with ascents and descents from, there. Holding the eels in the laboratory and aboard ship prior to tracking makes interpretation of observed movements relative to natural behaviour difficult: However, oriented swimming in midwater is consistent with previous reports in the literature of homing of displaced eels. The use of selective tidal stream transport has not been observed in other studies of adults of the European eel but has been reported in studies of estuarine movements of American eels (Anguilla rostrata).

The computational overhead of modelling such problems may be significant and costly. This paper aims to clarify the effects of particular phenomena associated with modelling tidal stream turbine arrays. To achieve this we use a RANS computational fluid dynamics model with an embedded blade element actuator disk to investigate various aspects of this problem, while maintaining reduced computational overhead.A study of axially aligned turbines, with each in the wake shadow of the previous turbine shows uniform effects for a 20 diameters downstream spacing, but more complex interaction for 10 diameters spacing. Investigation of the significance of inclusion of the nacelle and tower geometry in a CFD model shows that effects are negligible beyond six diameters downstream. An array of transverse contrarotating turbines are considered, where a device is placed close to and in the wake of a pair of upstream devices. Rotational direction has minimal effect on the power generated, but different turbulence is seen in the wake. Finally, marine currents around a headland are modelled and a single row fence of turbines is placed offshore from the headland at various blockage ratios. Power performance estimates and downstream wakes are created and they show increased power per device and improved total power production as the blockage ratio rises from 0.13 to 0.20. Additionally, the authors use stream surface techniques to visualise the flow which can give new insights to the physical processes observed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This likelihood is primarily based on the species being a diving seabird, and an inshore, benthic forager often associating with tidal streams. These behavioural properties may bring them into contact with turbine blades, or make them susceptible to alterations to tidal current speed, and/or changes in benthic habitat structure. We examine the knowledge currently available to assess the potential impacts of tidal stream turbines on black guillemot ecology, highlight knowledge gaps and make recommendations for future research. The key ecological aspects investigated include: foraging movements, diving behaviour, seasonal distribution, other sources of disturbance and colony recovery. Relating to foraging behaviour, between studies there is heterogeneity in black guillemot habitat use in relation to season, tide, diurnal cycles, and bathymetry. Currently, there is also little knowledge regarding the benthic habitats associated with foraging. With respect to diving behaviour, there is currently no available research regarding how black guillemots orientate and manoeuvre within the water column. Black guillemots are considered to be a non-migratory species, however little is known about their winter foraging range and habitat. The effect of human disturbance on breeding habitat and the metapopulation responses to potential mortalities are unknown. It is clear further understanding of black guillemot foraging habitat and behaviour is needed to provide renewable energy developers with the knowledge to sustainably locate tidal turbines and mitigate their impacts.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,7,0,12,,,0141-1136,1879-0291,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Highlands & Isl, North Highland Coll UHI, Environm Res Inst, Thurso KW14 7EE, ScotlandMacArthur Green Ltd, 95 South Woodside Rd, Glasgow G20 6NT, Lanark, ScotlandScottish Nat Heritage, Great Glen House,Leachkin Rd, Inverness IV3 8NW, Scotland",MacArthur Green LtdScottish Nat Heritage,,,2018-03-13,WOS:000426027100012,29370936,

During slack water, at the end of this tidal phase, they return to the bottom and remain there during the opposite tidal phase. Through this sequence, horizontal movement takes place in a series of saltatory steps. In coastal and estuarine areas, STST can be characterised as ebb- or flood-tide transport depending upon which phase of the tide is used for transport. Modelling studies indicate STST is a highly effective means of horizontal movement for life-history stages that have weak swimming abilities and for energy conservation by adults with strong swimming ability. Frequently, the direction of STST reverses within a species, especially at different physiological or life-cycle stages, For example, larvae of estuarine crabs undergo ebb-tide transport for migration out of estuaries for development offshore, whereas older post-larvae use flood-tide transport for movement up estuaries to nursery areas. The behaviour underlying STST is ascribed to (a) a tidal rhythm in activity or vertical migration or (b) behavioural responses to environmental cues associated with tides. If behavioural responses are involved, then recent studies suggest that no single cue is used for STST but that animals respond to a sequence of cues during transport. Collectively, STST is well documented in the field, but underlying behaviours need future study.",,,,,,,,,304,5,0,0,256,3,336,,,0078-3218,,0-415-23874-9,,,,,,,,,"Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm, Beaufort, NC 28516 USAFlorida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA",,,,2001-01-01,WOS:000173567300007,,

However, the potential impacts on pursuit-diving seabirds exploiting these tidal stream environments remain largely unknown. Identifying similarities between the fine-scale physical features (100s of metres) suitable for array installations, and those associated with foraging pursuit-diving seabirds, could identify which species are most vulnerable to either collisions with moving components, or displacement from these installations. A combination of vessel-based observational surveys, Finite Volume Community Ocean Model outputs and hydroacoustic seabed surveys provided concurrent measures of foraging distributions and physical characteristics at a fine temporal (15 min) and spatial (500 m) resolution across a tidal stream environment suitable for array installations, during both breeding and non-breeding seasons. These data sets were then used to test for associations between foraging pursuit-diving seabirds (Atlantic puffins Fratercula arctica, black guillemots Cepphus grylle, common guillemots Uria aalge, European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and physical features. These species were associated with areas of fast horizontal currents, slow horizontal currents, high turbulence, downward vertical currents and also hard-rough seabeds. The identity and strength of associations differed among species, and also within species between seasons, indicative of interspecific and intraspecific variations in habitat use. However, Atlantic puffins were associated particularly strongly with areas of fast horizontal currents during breeding seasons, and European shags with areas of rough-hard seabeds and downward vertical currents during non-breeding seasons. Synthesis and applications. Atlantic puffins strong association with fast horizontal current speeds indicates that they are particularly likely to interact with installations during breeding seasons. Any post-installation monitoring and mitigation measures should therefore focus on this species and season. The multi-species associations with high turbulence and downward vertical currents, which often coincide with fast horizontal current speeds, also highlight useful pre-installation mitigation measures via the omission of devices from these areas, reducing the overall likelihood of interactions. Environmental impact assessments (EIA) generally involve once-a-month surveys across 2-year periods. However, the approaches used in this study show that more focussed surveys can greatly benefit management strategies aiming to reduce the likelihood of negative impacts by facilitating the development of targeted mitigation measures. It is therefore recommended that these approaches contribute towards EIA within development sites. orkney_fallofwarness_seabirdenvironmentConcurrent information on seabird distributions and environmental variables at 500m and 15min resolution in the Fall Of Warness, Orkney, UK.FOW_Seabirdenvironment_Data.csv Copyright: CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of Aberdeen, United KingdomPlymouth Marine Laboratory, United Kingdom",University of AberdeenPlymouth Marine Laboratory,,,2016-05-24,DRCI:DATA2016125009642856,,

Mortality is often considerable at the end of the larval phase when species are undergoing settlement, so information about the biophysical mechanisms influencing larvae during this transition between habitats is crucial. For species dispersed passively, settlement is governed by oceanic processes controlling larval transport. However, many fishes have the ability to modify their dispersal behaviourally and patterns of settlement for these species are likely to be quite different. Predicting settlement patterns therefore requires knowledge of the relative importance of larval behaviour v. passive transport. In the present study, diadromous fishes from the Family Galaxiidae were surveyed to examine whether settlement is likely to result from fish settling passively (i.e. driven by environmental conditions) or whether larval behaviour may be important. Although catch rates were weakly negatively correlated with discharge, there was no evidence that fish were settling passively at the scales examined in the study. In comparison, fish appear to be using behaviours similar to selective tidal stream transport to facilitate movement into rivers from the ocean.

Particular attention was dedicated to asymmetry between the flood and ebb phases of the tidal cycle (due to the phase relationship between M-2 and M-4 constituents), and spring-neap variability of the available resource (due to M-2 and S-2 compound tides). A series of high-resolution models were exploited to (i) produce a detailed harmonic database of these three components, and (ii) characterize, using energy resource metrics, temporal variability of the available power density.

This very large resource has pushed the design of the turbine towards the stream velocities, depth, and seabed geology of this site. A second idea is an algorithm to control the pitch of close-packed vertical-axis generators to give an evenly distributed head. Finally, there are suggestions for a seabed attachment aimed specifically for conditions in the Pentland Firth and intended to allow rapid installation of a self-propelled tidal-stream generator.",,,,,,,,,33,1,0,0,0,0,36,,,0957-6509,2041-2967,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn & Elect, Edinburgh EH9 3JL, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2007-03-01,WOS:000246281500007,,

Due to the wide use of FVCOM in coastal applications where turbines are commonly installed, it proves necessary to address this issue. Two approaches with respect to modifying bed shear stress and turbulent mixing calculations in the presence of a turbine are proposed and tested in this research.

The gravity applied on a fluid is proportional to its density, thus the static pressure induced by gravity is enhanced by the higher density of water than air. Turbines are expected to be placed in fast moving, shallow flows. Hence the Froude number may be relatively high and changes to the free surface are likely, leading to additional flow confinement. In order to investigate the combined effect of vertical shear and gravity on idealized turbines, an extension of linear momentum actuator disc theory (LMADT) is used to estimate the thrust and power extracted by an idealized turbine for two types of free surface inviscid flow. It is assumed that there is fast pressure recovery and that the core flow contains self-similar velocity profiles. Results from a parameter study in which the velocity profiles and turbine settings are varied show that idealized turbines operate at higher efficiency under the effect of gravity, but operate at either higher or lower efficiency under shear flow. The proposed model can also be used to investigate energy extracted by turbines in a periodically spaced array, enabling better evaluation of array efficiency.

The model interpolates the speed and direction of the tidal current at any specified position and allows for the cyclical change of current speed between neap and spring tides. Fish behaviour is specified in terms of swimming speed and direction, as well as times of vertical migration and the duration of the intervening period in midwater. Times of vertical migration to and from the bottom can be specified theoretically in relation to regular tidal events (slackwater, high or low tide, etc.), or practically using actual observations made by sonar or data storage (archival) lags. Simulated tracks can be used singly to predict the behaviour of individual fish in relation to biological problems, or collectively to predict the distribution of whole populations in relation to management problems. These predictions can be formulated so that they can be tested experimentally. The model is being used to reconstruct the ground tracks of fish fitted with data storage (archival) tags and also to predict the theoretical movements of individuals and populations. It has been validated by reconstructing the ground tracks of fish tracked in the open sea using sector scanning sonar and transponding acoustic tags. Potential applications include estimating transfer coefficients for use in spatial assessment models, assessing the exchange of fish between fishable areas and areas closed to fishing for conservation reasons, and providing a theoretical framework for analysing returns from conventional fish tagging experiments.

The study site is the Alderney Race (Raz Blanchard in French) which is a straight located in the English Channel between the Alderney Island and La Hague cape (France). The estimation of the resource is used to build two realistic tidal energy extraction scenarios consisting in placing a 290 MW tidal turbine array in two different areas. Then, we analyze the impact of turbines on the hydrodynamics and the sediment transport. The hydrodynamic perturbation is restricted to the vicinity of the array where the mean current velocity reduction reaches 0.3 m/s locally (corresponding to 15% of the baseline velocity). Focusing on the variable driving the bedload (the critical erosion threshold exceedance), we confirm that tidal energy extraction tends to reduce the bedload rate and to deflect the sediment fluxes. Our simulations with a simple model for the suspended sediment transport suggest that tidal energy extraction has a significant effect on the area of deposition of the particles transiting through the tidal farm. For the baseline, the sediment particles transiting through the tidal farm deposit mostly in the eastern part of the English Channel. Depending on the location of the tidal farm, the sediment mass balance between the eastern and the western part of the English Channel changes drastically. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested whether this mechanism applies during the upstream migration of a poor swimmer, the European river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis, in a macrotidal estuary. Lamprey (n = 59) were acoustically tagged and tracked in a 40 km section of the River Ouse estuary (NE England) in autumn 2015. Against expectations, lamprey did not use STST and migrated upstream during flood, ebb and slack tide periods. Lamprey also migrated during both day and night in most of the study area, probably due to the high turbidity. The global migration speed (all individuals, over the entire track per individual) was (mean +/- SD) 0.15 +/- 0.07 m s(-1). The migration speed varied significantly between tidal periods (0.38 +/- 0.04 m s(-1) during flooding tides, 0.12 +/- 0.01 m s(-1) during ebbing tides and 0.28 +/- 0.01 m s(-1) during slacks). It was also higher in areas not affected by tides during periods of high freshwater discharge (0.23 +/- 0.08 m s(-1)) than in affected areas (0.17 +/- 0.14 m s(-1)). If the energetic advantages of STST are not employed in macrotidal environments, it is likely that the fitness costs of that behaviour exceed potential energy savings, for example due to increased duration of exposure to predation. In conclusion, STST is evidently not universal in relatively poor swimmers; its use can vary between species and may vary under different conditions.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Durham, Dept Biosci, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, EnglandUniv Santiago de Compostela, Fac Biol, Dept Zool Xenet & Antropol Fis, Campus Vida, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain",,,,2018-01-01,WOS:000418268900011,,

However, most energetic regions that have been identified as candidate sites for installation of TEC arrays exhibit some degree of directional and magnitude asymmetry between incident flood and ebb flow angles and velocities, particularly in nearshore environments where topographic, bathymetric and seabed frictional effects and interactions are significant. Understanding the contribution of directional and magnitude asymmetry to resource power density along with off axis rotor alignment to flow could influence site selection and help elucidate optimal turbine orientation. Here, 2D oceanographic model simulations and field data were analysed to investigate these effects at potential deployment locations in the Irish Sea; an energetic semi-enclosed shelf sea region. We find that observed sites exhibiting a high degree of asymmetry may be associated with a reduction of over 2% in annual energy yield when deployment design optimisation is ignored. However, at the majority of sites, even in the presence of significant asymmetry, the difference is < 0.3%.

Further analyses proved that Levelized Cost Of Energy (LCOE) for Hengam and Greater-Tunb Islands is 182.25 and 221.51 GBP/MWh respectively. With these LCOE values and current Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff (REFiT) rate in Iran, it is expected that the return of investment period in Hengam and Greater-Tunb Islands to be 18.77 and 23.79 years respectively.

The Sound was used to test the prototype of the Delta Stream by Tidal Energy Ltd. After initial testing, a 10 MW tidal array was proposed at St David's Head. To investigate any possible environmental impacts of the array due to energy extraction, a case study of the Pembrokeshire coast was performed using a high-resolution depth averaged hydrodynamic model, Telemac2D, to investigate changes to hydrodynamics and morphodynamics. Results show that the proposed array of nine tidal energy converters will cause alterations to eddy propagation leading to changes in the velocity field up to 24 km from the tidal array. Changes in morphodynamics are predicted through alterations to the bed shear stress. Changes to the mean and maximum bed shear stress, over a 30-day period, are found to be more localised and extend 12 km from the array. These changes indicate that the proposed tidal array will lead to localised sediment accumulation and will act as a barrier to sediment transport, with potential consequences for the benthic ecology of the region.

This paper summarises how TSW developments could affect seabirds, based on experience from other forms of disturbance, and explores the possible changes in behaviour and habitat that have the potential to increase a seabird's rate of energy acquisition (e.g. through enhancing prey abundance), or energy expenditure (e.g. through causing birds to commute further to find food, if they avoid foraging around developments placed in regular feeding areas). Changes to energy budgets could impact rates of reproduction and survival. Simulation modelling of seabird energetics and behaviour is one possible tool for predicting the direction and magnitude of population impacts caused by alterations to energy budgets, but is dependant on the availability and accuracy of necessary parameters. The later sections of the paper review the information needed for such models and shows that although some data are available regarding rates of energy expenditure during specific activities, more information is needed on seabird foraging rates. The paper also highlights how the susceptibility of a species to be impacted by future TSW development is likely to be related to their method of foraging, flight behaviour and ability to buffer against environmental fluctuations.

However, the potential impacts on pursuit-diving seabirds exploiting these tidal stream environments remain largely unknown. Identifying similarities between the fine-scale physical features (100s of metres) suitable for array installations, and those associated with foraging pursuit-diving seabirds, could identify which species are most vulnerable to either collisions with moving components, or displacement from these installations. A combination of vessel-based observational surveys, Finite Volume Community Ocean Model outputs and hydroacoustic seabed surveys provided concurrent measures of foraging distributions and physical characteristics at a fine temporal (15min) and spatial (500m) resolution across a tidal stream environment suitable for array installations, during both breeding and non-breeding seasons. These data sets were then used to test for associations between foraging pursuit-diving seabirds (Atlantic puffins Fratercula arctica, black guillemots Cepphus grylle, common guillemots Uria aalge, European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and physical features. These species were associated with areas of fast horizontal currents, slow horizontal currents, high turbulence, downward vertical currents and also hard-rough seabeds. The identity and strength of associations differed among species, and also within species between seasons, indicative of interspecific and intraspecific variations in habitat use. However, Atlantic puffins were associated particularly strongly with areas of fast horizontal currents during breeding seasons, and European shags with areas of rough-hard seabeds and downward vertical currents during non-breeding seasons.Synthesis and applications. Atlantic puffins' strong association with fast horizontal current speeds indicates that they are particularly likely to interact with installations during breeding seasons. Any post-installation monitoring and mitigation measures should therefore focus on this species and season. The multi-species associations with high turbulence and downward vertical currents, which often coincide with fast horizontal current speeds, also highlight useful pre-installation mitigation measures via the omission of devices from these areas, reducing the overall likelihood of interactions. Environmental impact assessments (EIA) generally involve once-a-month surveys across 2-year periods. However, the approaches used in this study show that more focussed surveys can greatly benefit management strategies aiming to reduce the likelihood of negative impacts by facilitating the development of targeted mitigation measures. It is therefore recommended that these approaches contribute towards EIA within development sites.Atlantic puffins' strong association with fast horizontal current speeds indicates that they are particularly likely to interact with installations during breeding seasons.

Recent studies in channels with 1-D models have indicated that the power potential is not given purely by the flux of kinetic energy, as has been commonly assumed. In this study, a 3-D ocean circulation model is used to estimate (i) practically extractable energy resource at different levels of rated generation capacity of the farm, (ii) changes in the strength of currents due to energy extraction, and (iii) alterations in the pattern of residual currents and the pathways of passive tracers. As well as tidal streams, the model also takes into account the wind-driven and density-driven ocean currents. Numerical modelling has been carried out for a hypothetical tidal farm located in the Celtic Sea north of Cornwall, an area known for its high level of tidal energy. Modelling results clearly indicate that the extracted power does not grow linearly with the increase in the rated capacity of the farm. For the case study covered in this paper, a 100-fold increase in the rated generation capacity of the farm results in only 7-fold increase in extracted power. In the case of a high power farm, kinetic energy of currents is altered significantly as far as 10-20 km away from the farm. At high levels of extracted energy the currents tend to avoid flowing through the farm, an effect which is not captured with 1-D models. Residual currents are altered as far as a hundred kilometres away. The magnitude of changes in the dispersion of tracers is highly sensitive to the location. Some of the passive drifters analysed in this study experience significant variations in the end-to-start distance due to energy extraction ranging from 13% to 238% while others are practically unaffected. This study shows that both energy extraction estimates and effects on region wide circulation depend on a complex combination of factors, and the specific figures given in the paper should be generally considered as first estimates.",,,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,6,0,41,,,1812-0784,1812-0792,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Plymouth, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",,,,2011-03-23,WOS:000287801000013,,

Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is used worldwide to study potential impacts of marine industrial activities on cetaceans, but understanding of animals' site use at small spatiotemporal scales (< 1 km, < 1 day) remains limited. Small-scale variability in vocalising harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) distribution within two Scottish marine renewable energy development (MRED) sites was investigated by deploying dense arrays of C-POD passive acoustic detectors at a wave energy test site (the European Marine Energy Centre [Billia Croo, Orkney]) and by a minor tidal-stream site (Scarba [Inner Hebrides]). Respective arrays consisted of 7 and 11 moorings containing two C-PODs each and were deployed for up to 55 days. Minimum inter mooring distances varied between similar to 300-600 m. All C-POD data were analysed at a temporal resolution of whole minutes, with each minute classified as 1 or 0 on the basis of presence/absence of porpoise click trains (Porpoise-Positive Minutes/PPMs). Porpoise detection rates were analysed using Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) with Generalised Estimation Equations (GEES).Although there were many porpoise detections (wave test site: N=3,432; tidal-stream site: N=17,366), daily detection rates varied significantly within both arrays. Within the wave site array (< 1 km diameter), average daily detection rates varied from 43 to 14.8 PPMs/day. Within the tidal stream array (< 2 km diameter), average daily detection rates varied from 10.3 to 49.7 PPMs/day. GAM-GEE model results for individual moorings within both arrays indicated linkages between porpoise presence and small-scale heterogeneity among different environmental covariates (e.g., tidal phase, time of day). Porpoise detection rates varied considerably but with coherent patterns between moorings only several hundred metres apart and within hours. These patterns presumably have ecological relevance.These results indicate that, in energetically active and heterogeneous areas, porpoises can display significant spatiotemporal variability in site use at scales of hundreds of metres and hours. Such variability will not be identified when using solitary moored PAM detectors (a common practice for site-based cetacean monitoring), but may be highly relevant for site-based impact assessments of MRED and other coastal developments. PAM arrays encompassing several detectors spread across a site therefore appear to be a more appropriate tool to study site-specific cetacean use of spatiotemporally heterogeneous habitat and assess the potential impacts of coastal and nearshore developments at small scales.

Current industry standards generally use a decoupled numerical approach to assess this problem, but this paper presents the development of a framework for an efficient numerical tool that is capable of predicting the fully nonlinear, coupled behaviour of floating tidal stream systems. Using the open-source CFD libraries of OpenFOAM as a basis, and a previously developed computationally efficient turbine model, the framework has been demonstrated using a generalised system. Verification against alternative codes based on linear potential theory shows good agreement when the floating structure is considered alone in linear waves. Systematic introduction of mooring forces and the turbine model demonstrates that it is necessary to consider all components of a floating tidal concept simultaneously, and that coupling between platform motion and fluid flow can substantially increase the cyclic amplitude of the turbine loading compared with a fixed device.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,0029-8018,1873-5258,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Plymouth, Sch Engn Comp & Math, Plymouth, Devon, EnglandSaipem UK Ltd, Dept Engn, Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey, EnglandPlymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth, Devon, England",Saipem UK Ltd,,,2021-01-19,WOS:000598977600105,,

Along with the European targets it is expected that large farms of Wave Energy Converters (WECs) will be installed in the sea and, as part of the consenting process for their installation, it will be necessary to quantify their impact on the local environment. The objective of this study is to improve the assessment of WEC farms impact on the surrounding wave field (wake effect) through the use of a numerical coupling methodology. The methodology consists of a Boundary Element Method (BEM) solver to obtain the wave perturbation generated by the WEC farm for the near-field accounting for the wave-body interactions within the farm whilst a Wave Propagation Model (WPM) based on the mild-slope equations determines the wave transformation in the far-field. The near-field solution obtained from the BEM solver is described as an internal boundary condition in the WPM and then it is propagated throughout the WPM numerical domain. The internal boundary is described by imposing the solution of the surface elevation and velocity potential at the free-surface at each instant of time along a line surrounding the WEC farm.As a case study the methodology was applied to flap type WECs that are deployed in shallow water conditions. The validation of the technique was done first for a single flap and then for a farm of 5 flaps. Once validated, a realistic scenario was assessed by quantifying the impact of irregular sea states composed of long crested waves on a large WEC farm composed of 18 flaps and located on a real bathymetry. The irregular waves were obtained by superposing the regular wave field solutions for all wave frequencies represented in the considered sea state based on the linear water wave theory. Within the limits of this theory these simulations demonstrate the versatility of the methodology to accurately represent the impact of a WEC farm on the surrounding wave climate.

All basins in the stare will be sampled over a three-year period, 1995-97.

Based on fish IBI scores at 270 stream sites in six basins sampled in 1995, 11% of non-tidal stream miles in Maryland were classified as very poor, 15% as poor, 24% as fair, and 27% as good.

A number of prospective tidal energy sites have been identified, but the local hydrodynamics of these sites are often poorly understood. Tidal energy developers rely on detailed characterisation of tidal energy sites prior to device installation and field trials. Although first-order appraisals may make macrotidal tidal straits appear attractive for development, detailed, site-specific hydrodynamic and bathymetric surveys are important for determining site suitability for tidal stream turbine (TST) installation. Understanding the ways in which coastal features affect tidal velocities at potential TST development sites will improve identification and analysis of physical constraints on tidal energy development. This paper presents and examines tidal velocity data measured in Ramsey Sound (Pembrokeshire, Wales, UK), an energetic macrotidal strait, which will soon host Wales' first TST demonstration project. While maximum tidal velocities in the strait during peak spring flood exceed 3 m s(-1), the northern portion of Ramsey Sound exhibits a marked flood-dominated tidal asymmetry. Furthermore, local bathymetric features affect flow fields that are spatially heterogeneous in three dimensions, patterns that depth-averaged velocity data (measured and modelled) tend to mask. Depth-averaging can therefore have a significant effect on power estimations. Analysis of physical and hydrodynamic characteristics in Ramsey Sound, including tidal velocities across the swept area of the pilot TST, variations in the stream flow with depth, estimated power output, water depth and bed slope, suggests that the spatial and temporal variability in the flow field may render much of Ramsey Sound unsuitable for tidal power extraction. Although the resource potential depends on velocity and bathymetric conditions that are fundamentally local, many prospective tidal energy sites are subject to similar physical and hydrodynamic constraints. Results of this study can help inform site selection in these complicated, highly dynamic macrotidal environments. In order to fully characterise the structure of the tidal currents, these data should be supplemented with 3-D modelling, particularly in areas subject to a highly irregular bathymetry and complicated tidal regime.

Owing to the relatively small number of existing developments and the early stage of their associated environmental monitoring programmes, the effects of MREDs on seabirds are not fully known. Our ability to fully predict potential effects is limited by a lack of knowledge regarding movements of seabirds at sea. We used GPS tracking to improve our understanding of the movements at sea of a protected seabird species breeding in Scotland, the great skua (Stercorarius skua), to better predict how this species may be affected by MREDs. We found that the overlap of great skuas with leased and proposed MREDs was low; particularly with offshore wind sites, which are predicted to present a greater risk to great skuas than wave or tidal-stream developments. Failed breeders overlapped with larger areas of MREDs than breeding birds but the overall overlap with core areas used remained low. Overlap with wave energy development sites was greater than for offshore wind and tidal-stream sites. Comparison of 2011 data with historical data indicates that distances travelled by great skuas have likely increased over recent decades. This suggests that basing marine spatial planning decisions on short-term tracking data could be less informative than longer-term data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

IEC Technical specifications were considered in the model configurations and simulations. The model was calibrated and validated with field measurements. Energy fluxes and power densities along selected cross sections were calculated to evaluate the feasibility of the tidal energy development at several hotspots that feature strong currents. When taking both the high current speed and water depth into account, the model results showed that the Western Passage has great potential for the deployment of tidal energy farms.

Subsequently, there has been a hike in fuel prices. Unfortunately, the planet is left to bear the brunt in form of pollution. These factors have put forward a pressing demand of research for eco-friendly and renewable resources. In this domain, tidal energy offers a promising future. Tides are produced due to the interactive orbital mechanics of solar & planetary systems. Security, diversity of supply, intermittence and predictability are few of the compelling factors in pursuit of tidal power. Tidal energy comprises of both kinetic and potential energy. The tidal stream technologies include a horizontal axis turbine and a vertical axis turbine. This study is focused on horizontal axis turbines. The horizontal axis marine turbine operates on same principles as wind turbines. The energy transformation process is quite simple. The turbine rotor is driven by the tidal current. The motion of the rotor converts mechanical energy into rotational energy. Gear box transmits shaft's rotational energy to generator which converts this energy into electricity. Shroud/ ducts/ diffuser are used to improve the efficiency of the horizontal axis marine turbine. Shroud/ ducts/ diffuser deploy diffuser and hydrofoil principles to accelerate water streamline. Power generated is proportional to cube to steam velocity. This paper aims at presenting a comprehensive review of the horizontal axis marine turbines.

The platform is a floating structure moored to the seabed by a single-point fully articulated anchorage, and carries three power trains and a number of marine auxiliaries. The driver for the design as developed by Tidal Stream Ltd is to reduce the cost of energy production in order to compete with the current cost of offshore wind. Independently audited cost modelling shows that tidal stream energy can become competitive with offshore wind, achieving a generating cost as low as 10p/kWh at the best sites. This generating cost is estimated to be less than half that which could be achieved at a similar site from a single seabed-located turbine.The driving aspects for the competitive cost are maximising the capacity per mooring point, reducing installation costs by float-out solutions and by providing easy access to the tidal equipment. Access is achieved by allowing the platform to come to the surface by means of de-ballasting. By doing so, there is no need for large workboats and/or diver activities to perform regular inspection and maintenance on the tidal equipment, reducing the cost significantly.The technical aspects that arise when developing the tidal turbine platform for a typical offshore location are investigated by Houlder Ltd and discussed in this paper. A number of technical challenges have been addressed where the rotational stability in both roll and pitch are of interest. The roll of the platform is heavily affected by the performance of the turbines; sudden increase or reduction in thrust will induce significant rolling moments that must not impair the integrity of the platform. Pitching of the platform allows it to reach the surface when de-ballasted for maintenance and inspection. During normal operations, the platform remains aligned with the current and in doing so maximises the performance of the turbines.The paper illustrates how these aspects have been achieved by means of passive solutions. By means of positioning and shaping the main body of the platform, a working configuration has been developed where the rotations of the platform remain within a limited window maximising the potential power production. The concept has been tested by Tidal Stream during a large-scale model testing campaign where the unit was subject to different current speeds and different turbine configurations and fault cases. This publication compares the results of the large scale model testing with numerical models developed in OrcaFlex and shows the effectiveness of the passive solutions.",,,,,"32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 09-14, 2013JUN 09-14, 2013","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Nantes, FRANCENantes, FRANCE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5542-3,,,,,,,,,"Houlder Ltd, London, EnglandTidalStream Ltd, London, England",Houlder LtdTidalStream Ltd,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000360869000017,,

The system is tested against comprehensive measurements in a water flume experiment and results of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The validation results suggest that the new modelling system is proven to be able to accurately simulate hydrodynamics with the presence of turbines. The developed turbine simulation system is then applied to a series of test cases in which a standalone turbine is deployed.

The analysis is applied to Gadiz Bay (Southern Spain), where important human interventions are developing, specifically a new port terminal and a 5 km long bridge. Due to these interventions, significant impacts on the bay hydrodynamics are expected. To assess the variations on the tidal energy resource after interventions, a three dimensional numerical model is used to obtain the bay hydrodynamics (Delft3D model). It was calibrated and validated against water levels and currents at tidal and sub-tidal scales using the results of two extensive field surveys. Two scenarios are defined, corresponding to the pre and post interventions situations. Results show that before interventions, only one area has the potential to locate a Tidal Energy Converter (TEC) array. However, after interventions a new area arise due to the increase of flow velocities induced by human modifications of the bay geometry. The energy potential is assessed for these two locations, and their efficiencies (potential energy per device) are obtained, indicating that after interventions the new TEC array is even more efficient than that of the pre interventions scenario, and an increase of 20% in the energy that can be potentially produced is obtained.

In this study, the potential of the Yucatan Current was analysed at nearshore sites over the insular shelf of Cozumel Island in the Mexican Caribbean. Field measurements were undertaken using a vessel-mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) to analyse the spatial distribution of flow velocities, along with Conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiles as well as data gathering of bathymetry and water elevations. Northward directed flow velocities were identified, with increasing velocities just before the end of the strait of the Cozumel Channel, where average velocities in the region of 0.88-1.04 m s(-1) were recorded.

We investigated the movements, distribution and behaviour of cod in the southern North Sea (ICES IVc) and English Channel (ICES VIId) by re-analysing historic data from conventional tagging experiments, and by conducting new experiments with electronic tags. Cod tagged and released in IVc showed a northwards shift in distribution during the feeding season consistent with a homing migration away from spawning grounds along the coasts of the UK and the Netherlands. In contrast, cod tagged and released in VIId did not exhibit a consistent pattern of seasonal movement. Many cod released in VIId were subsequently recaptured close to their release position, although some moved out of the Channel and into the southern North Sea. Overlap between the recapture areas of cod released in the different management areas was no more than 25% in either the spawning or feeding season. Behavioural data from electronic tags suggest that cod in IVc make use of tidal streams to migrate northwards and eastwards in spring, whereas selective tidal stream transport was rarely exhibited by cod tagged and released in VIId.

This study builds on recent methodological developments to reveal the behaviour of fish schools using data collected by a seabed-mounted echosounder deployed in extreme tidal flows and in the wake of a MREI (composed of the foundation of a full-scale tidal stream energy turbine). The results show a significant change (p < 0.001) in the vertical distribution of fish schools in the vicinity of a MREI compared to a nearby control location representative of the natural conditions. The MREI is associated with an overall increased rate of fish school observations (+ 74%), particularly at night (+ 163%) and in the MREI wake flow (+ 378%), related to the disruption of natural diurnal behavioural patterns in school characteristics (size, relative density, and distance from seabed). These results indicate an attraction effect of the MREI, and show that the aggregation and vertical distribution of fish in the modified flow conditions is dependent on tidal phase with evidence of avoidance of the MREI depth range during peak flow velocities.

Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) required for potential MRE sites generally involve site-specific animal density estimates obtained from lengthy and costly surveys. Recent studies indicate that whilst large-scale tidal forcing is predictable, local hydrodynamics are variable and often result in spatio-temporal patchiness of marine predators. Therefore, understanding how fine-scale hydrodynamics influence animal distribution patterns could inform the placing of devices to reduce collision and displacement risks. Quantifying distributions requires animal at-sea locations and the concurrent collection of high-resolution hydrodynamic measurements. As the latter are routinely collected during tidal resource characterization at potential MRE sites, there is an untapped opportunity to efficiently collect information on the former to improve ElAs. Here we describe a survey approach that uses vessel-mounted ADCP (Acoustic Doppler current profiler) transects in combination with marine mammal surveys to collect high-resolution and concurrent hydrodynamic data in relation to pinniped (harbour seals Phoca vitulina, grey seals Halichoerus grypus) at-sea occupancy patterns within an energetic tidal channel (peak current magnitudes > 4.5 ms(-1)). We identified novel ADCP-derived fine-scale hydrodynamic metrics that could have ecological relevance for seals using these habitats. We show that our local acoustic backscattering strength metric (an indicator for macro-turbulence) had the highest influence on seal encounters. During peak flows, pinnipeds avoided the mid-channel characterized by extreme backscatter. At-sea occupancy further corresponded with the increased shear and eddies that are strong relative to the mean flows found at the edges of the channel. Our approach, providing oceanographic context to animal habitat use through combined survey methodologies, enhances environmental management of potential MRE sites. The cost-effective collection of such data and the application of our metrics could streamline the EIA process in the early stages of the consenting process.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,7,0,13,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,,,,,,,"Queens Univ, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Marine Lab, 12-13 Strand, Portaferry BT22 1PF, North IrelandUniv Plymouth, Marine Inst, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandBangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, AB, Wales",Queens Univ,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000452692500041,,

During the first phase of the spawning migration, non-ovigerous females migrate seaward from brackish water to the mouths of estuaries following insemination. After oviposition, females with mature embryos undertake the second phase of the spawning migration, in which they undergo ebb-tide transport for movement seaward to release larvae and then migrate back into estuaries using flood-tide transport. Following larval development offshore, post-larvae or megalopae undergo flood-tide transport for up-estuary movement in which they ascend into the water column during flood tides at night and are on or near the bottom at all other times. This behavioral pattern is not due to a circatidal rhythm in activity since megalopae have a circadian rhythm. The timing of this endogenous rhythm is paradoxical because megalopae are active during the day phase and inactive at night. Neither exposure to a cycle in salinity change that simulates the natural tidal cycle nor step decreases in salinity alter this circadian rhythm. The behavior underlying flood-tide transport consists of behavioral responses to a sequence of cues. Megalopae ascend into the water column in response to the relative rate of increase in salinity during flood tide. Water turbulence due to flood-tide currents induces sustained swimming, and the decline in turbulence during slack water at end of flood tide induces settlement out of the water column. Environmental cues during ebb tide do not induce STST Since light inhibits swimming, flood-tide transport does not occur during the day and is reduced when the time of slack water after flood tide occurs after sunrise.

The postlarval stage (megalopa) occurs near the surface and is transported shoreward by wind-driven surface currents. It then uses selective tidal stream transport for migration up an estuary. Endogenous swimming rhythms were measured under constant dark conditions in the laboratory in megalopae collected from the Newport River Estuary (North Carolina), the Delaware Bay, and offshore from the Newport River Estuary. Megalopae from all areas had a similar circadian activity rhythm, in which they swam during the time of the day phase in the field and were inactive at night. This rhythm pr-edicts the presence of a reverse, diel, vertical-migration pattern offshore which would contribute to the location of megalopae near the surface during the day. The rhythm lacks obvious ecological significance in estuaries because it does not contribute to selective tidal stream transport and would increase vulnerability to visual predators during the day. Attempts to entrain a circatidal rhythm in swimming by cyclic and step changes in salinity were unsuccessful, as the circadian rhythm persisted. The rhythm also continued in the presence of the eelgrass Zostera marina, which is a site of settlement and metamorphosis in the field. Thus, megalopae enter estuaries with a solar day rhythm in activity. This rhythm, however, is not expressed, because light inhibits swimming during the day upon exposure to estuarine water. Since this light inhibition is removed in offshore waters, the rhythm would be expressed if, after entering an estuary, megalopae were transported back to offshore areas.",,,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,22,0,56,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1997-03-01,WOS:A1997WQ42500011,,

The majority of these targets, which were probably small midwater fish shoals, were observed to move in the direction of the tidal stream. After making allowances for the speed and direction of the tidal current at the time the observations were made, the true courses of the shoals were calculated and about 70% of them were shown to be swimming in the direction of the tide. Taking into consideration the limitations of the method and particularly the reduced performance of the equipment, full confidence cannot be given to the above result; further work with the improved equipment is required before the nature of the results can be attributed to the behaviour of the fish.

Tidal stream devices have been developed as an alternative method of extracting the energy from the tides. This form of tidal power technology poses less threat to the environment & does not face the same limiting factors associated with tidal barrage schemes, therefore making it a more feasible method of electricity production. Universally the tides can be harness with tidal turbines-of which there are two main bifurcation-vertical axis & horizontal axis. In this paper only the vertical axis tidal turbine is focused. Some suggestion & corrosion prevention techniques are also discussed in this study. In addition, the progression of technological advancements tracing several decades of R&D efforts on vertical axis turbines are highlighted.

Larvae migrate to nursery grounds in estuarine Florida Bay. Using a numerical approach, we investigated the role of spawning location, larval traits, and physical forces on the transport of pink shrimp larvae. First, the Regional Oceanic Modeling System that is based on tides, air-ocean fluxes, and freshwater flows was used to simulate the SWF shelf oceanography. The model replicates the tides, winds, salinity, currents, and seasonality of the shelf. Secondly, the Regional Oceanic Modeling System was coupled offline with the Connectivity Modeling System, in which virtual larvae were released near the surface from two spawning sites, Dry Tortugas and Marquesas, and tracked until the time for settlement (about 28-30 d). Virtual larvae moved vertically in the water column following ontogenetic behaviors previously observed in the field: diel vertical migration (DVM) and selective tidal stream transport (STST). Lagrangian trajectories indicated that migration paths changed radically between summer and winter during model years (1995-1997). Maximum settlements occurred in summer by larvae crossing the SWF shelf, while the lowest settlement occurred in winter by larvae moving through passes in the Florida Keys. Modeling results demonstrated an effective east-northeast transport across the SWF shelf during summer as a result of the tidal currents, the subtidal currents, and the combined DVM and STST behaviors. The current phase captured during the initial DVM period was critical to determine the direction in which larvae move, favorable (east and northward) or unfavorable (south and westward), before the STST behavior captures the eastward tidal current that brings larvae to the nursery grounds. Unfavorable currents were driven by the summer easterlies and low salinities at the coast. Results indicated that Marquesas is the more effective spawning ground, with 4.5 times more likely settlement of originating larvae compared with Dry Tortugas. Model-estimated seasonal settlement patterns concurred with postlarval influxes previously observed at Florida Bay boundaries.",,,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,18,0,31,,,1942-5120,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USAFlorida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch, Oceanog Inst, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USANOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Miami, FL 33149 USA",,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000362351200012,,

In this review, we (1) place foraging within the context of current knowledge on behaviors that influence dispersal and transport, (2) provide evidence for foraging behavior as a driving mechanism of distributions, and (3) present a meta-analysis of dispersal distances estimated for three dispersal hypotheses (passive, swimming directly against currents, and foraging behavior) from 59 studies that document oceanographic conditions and in situ organism distributions. Results of the analyses reveal that when foraging and aggregative behaviors are considered, dispersal distances for larvae and zooplankton could be hundreds of kilometers less than many current dispersal estimates.

In this work, we focus on the flow field impact assessment of an assumed tidal farm installed in Zhoushan Putuo-Hulu Channel. First, in order to evaluate the tidal characteristics there, a 2-month ADCP campaign is carried out, and a 3-D hydrodynamic model is established and validated with the in-situ measurements. Additionally, tidal current velocity and water depth as well as flow heading asymmetry information are used to evaluate the tidal stream exploitability within this channel. Second, a tidal farm consisting of 115 turbines is planned and assumed to be deployed throughout this channel. Blade element momentum method is used to numerically characterize the flow-turbine interactions, and then the spatial-temporal flow field variations caused by the assumed tidal farm are evaluated. It can be seen from the results that the peak flow speed reduction produced by the tidal farm could be over 0.5 m/s within the wake zones, while the flow velocity increment along two islands could reach 0.6 m/s. In particular, a flow speed phase shift phenomenon can be observed. Besides, the water level experiences a small overall rise, and the difference compared with the reference is within +/- 3.0 cm. Moreover, the seabed shear stress within the wake zones could drop by 65%, while the areas along the two islands might see over 100% increase, indicating the risk of sediment deposition and coastal erosion.",,,,,,,,,10,2,0,0,1,0,11,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Inst Ocean Engn & Technol, Zhoushan 316021, Peoples R China",,,,2020-06-09,WOS:000535989100004,,

The influence of tidal stirring is generally well represented as a competition between surface buoyancy input and the production of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) by frictional stresses, a competition which is encapsulated in the Qh/u(3) criterion. An alternative control mechanism arises from the limitation of the thickness of the bottom boundary layer due to the effects of rotation and the oscillation of the flow. Model studies indicate that, for conditions typical of the European shelf seas, the energy constraint exerts the dominant control but that for tidal streams with large positive polarisation (i.e. anti-clockwise rotation of velocity vector), some influence of rotation in limiting mixing should be detectable. We report here measurements of flow structure (with ADCPs) and turbulent dissipation (FLY Profiler) made at two similar locations in the Celtic Sea which differ principally in that the tidal currents rotate in opposite senses with approximately equal magnitude (polarity P = +/- 0. 6). A clear contrast was observed between the two sites in the vertical structure of the currents, the density profile and the rate of dissipation of TKE. At the positive polarity (PP) site (P approximate to +0.6), the bottom boundary layer in the tidal flow was limited to similar to 20 mab (metre above the bed) and significant dissipation from bottom boundary friction was constrained within this layer. At the negative polarity (NP) site (P approximate to -0.6), the dominant clockwise rotary current component exhibited a velocity defect (i.e. reduction relative to the free stream) extending into the upper half of the water column while significant dissipation was observed to penetrate much further up the water column with dissipation levels similar to 10(-4-5) W m(-3) reaching to the base of the pycnocline at 70-80 mab. These contrasting features of the vertical distribution of dissipation are well reproduced by a 1-D model when run with windstress and tidal forcing and using the observed density profile. Model runs with reversed polarity at the two sites, support the conclusion that the observed contrast in the structure of tidal velocity, dissipation and stratification is due to the influence of tidal stream polarity.

Water levels, tidal currents and flushing characteristics could potentially be significantly altered with the introduction of tidal turbine farms, which could lead to possible loss of habitat and a change in the tidal regime. Therefore, planning of tidal turbines field deployments must take into account possible hydro-environmental impacts. This paper describes research undertaken by the authors in the Shannon Estuary to predict changes in the tidal regime and flushing characteristics, with the introduction of tidal turbine farms of different array configurations. The model was simulated using a 2D hydrodynamic model that was modified to incorporate the effects of tidal turbine fields. Water levels are shown to have been affected with the inclusion of turbines, especially in areas upstream of the turbine farm where inter-tidal zones could become predominately inundated resulting in loss of habitat in the estuary. Flushing parameters were also shown to be altered with the inclusion of turbines, with residence time shown to be increased, which could change pollutant transport in the region.

Energy conversion has often been implemented in ocean models with enhanced turbine stress terms formulated using an array-averaging approach, rather than implementing extraction at device-scale. In depth-averaged models, an additional drag term in the momentum equations is usually applied. However, such array-averaging simulations neglect intra-array device wake interactions, providing unrealistic energy extraction dynamics. Any induced simulation error will increase with array size. For this study, an idealized channel is discretized at sub 10 m resolution, resolving individual device wake profiles of tidal turbines in the domain. Sensitivity analysis is conducted on the applied turbulence closure scheme, validating results against published data from empirical scaled turbine studies. We test the fine scale model performance of several mesh densities, which produce a centerline velocity wake deficit accuracy (R-2) of 0.58-0.69 (RMSE = 7.16-8.28%) using a k-? turbulence closure scheme. Various array configurations at device scale are simulated and compared with an equivalent array-averaging approach by analyzing channel flux differential. Parametrization of array-averaging energy extraction techniques can misrepresent simulated energy transfer and removal. The potential peak error in channel flux exceeds 0.5% when the number of turbines n(TECs) approximate to 25 devices. This error exceeds 2% when simulating commercial-scale turbine array farms (i.e., >100 devices).",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Bangor Univ, Marine Ctr Wales, Ctr Appl Marine Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Gwynedd, WalesBangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Gwynedd, Wales",,,,2018-11-29,WOS:000449293500360,,

The ability of larvae to move vertically in the water column to selectively ride favourable currents and maintain ground gained is critical to this process. The mud crab (Scylla serrata) is a widely distributed, commercially and recreationally important portunid crab but little is known about its estuarine recruitment mechanisms or the vertical migration behaviour of its megalopae. In studies of the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), important factors identified in the recruitment mechanism include altered vertical swimming behaviours in estuarine and offshore water and an endogenous circadian rhythm. Using laboratory experiments we examined the vertical displacement response of mud crab megalopae to illumination in estuarine and offshore water during the day and the night. Mud crab megalopae released into I m high towers swam higher when illuminated than when in darkness. This behaviour was repeated during the day and the night and in offshore and estuarine water. Given the apparent indifference to water type and the fact that mud crab megalopae are rarely caught in estuaries, we propose the model that these crabs do not invade estuaries as megalopae, but settle and metamorphose into small crabs on the coastal shelf before moving along the sea bed into estuarine habitats.

Correlation coefficients obtained under these conditions at the three locations are higher than 0.84 and 0.8 for current velocity and turbulent kinetic energy, respectively.

However, the means by which such transport occurs is poorly understood. We address how estuarine circulation and larval behaviors serve to transport larvae of the bay anchovy. In two successive summer seasons, we conducted multiple near-synoptic samples of larval distributions and water column structure along a 45-km section of the middle Hudson River estuary. The analysis focuses on patterns in the vertical distribution of larvae that may help explain transport, and the along-river distribution of different ontogenetic stages. The prediction that post-flexion larvae induce selective tidal-stream transport (STST) by vertically migrating in conjunction with tidal or diel cycles was tested via harmonic regression. Larval concentrations and average larval depths often varied with tidal stage. Maximum concentrations tended to occur at times of slack water, and larvae were often closer to the surface during slack tides as well. These patterns may be the result of tidal movements of horizontal abundance gradients. rather than vertical migrations. The prediction that larval transport is facilitated by a preference for deep water was addressed via analysis of variance, testing for depth effects on time-averaged concentration estimates. At some sites, larvae were most concentrated at intermediate depths, which would promote retention (no net horizontal movement) or slow up-river transport. However, in 1996, larvae were found most concentrated at the surface at two sites, suggesting down-river advection. With respect to along-river distribution, we tested the prediction that ontogenetic stages differed in their distribution in a manner consistent with up-river transport. In 1995, pre-flexion larvae were distributed further up river than eggs, and post-flexion larvae were slightly up river of pre-flexion larvae. Along-river distributions were perturbed in 1996 by a storm that caused high run-off and forced larvae down river. Following this event, along-river position did not vary with ontogenetic stage. The study design that combined analysis of larval depth distribution and along-river distribution enabled us to make and test predictions regarding transport processes. A portion of our depth distribution data implied stasis or weak up-river advection, and we found evidence that this was the case.

Such changes range from complex alterations in local conditions, as in the intertidal zone, to simpler variations in current speed and direction offshore. To take advantage of the opportunities these changes provide, many animals undertake regular vertical and/or horizontal migratory movements in synchrony with the tidal cycle. Others use tidal currents selectively for transport to new habitats. Such movements vary in extent from a few mm to several km and may be modulated by the diel cycle of light intensity. This paper reviews the existence of tidal migration in marine animals from various taxa and habitats. Crustacean and fish examples illustrate the various functions of tidal migration, including transport, feeding, predator avoidance and reproduction. These functions are not necessarily mutually exclusive and may change throughout ontogeny.

Advances in computing resources and numerical model codes have enabled high resolution 3-D ocean models to be applied at basin scales, albeit at a much higher computational cost than the traditional 2-D modelling approach. Here, a comparison between 2-D and 3-D tidal energy extraction modelling techniques is undertaken within a 3-D modelling framework, and differences between the methods are examined from both resource and impact assessment perspectives. Through a series of numerical experiments using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), it is shown that 3-D tidal energy extraction can be successfully incorporated in a regional ocean model of the Pentland Firth- one of the top regions in the world for tidal stream energy development. We demonstrate that resolving 3-D flow is important for reducing uncertainty in environmental resource assessments. Further, our results show that 2-D tidal energy extraction methods lead to a misrepresentation of the velocity profile when applied to 3-D models, demonstrating the importance of resolving 3-D flows in the vicinity of tidal arrays.

Management plans had no effect on zooplankton abundance, but a significant effect was found with the location within the perimeter ditch, with culverts having a higher overall abundance compared to interior points. The six most abundant taxa, in declining order of abundance, were juvenile flatworms, copepods, nauplii, rotifers, gastropod veligers, and nematodes. Specifically, juvenile flatworms, copepods, nauplii, and nematodes were more abundant at culverts. Dye diffusion studies revealed that areas with the lowest flow rates always had the highest species diversity and 'Evenness' was always higher in the interior of perimeter ditches. Impoundments appear to have the highest zooplankton densities recorded in the literature for any habitat. Canonical Correspondence Analysis of environmental data suggests that different water masses (coastal vs. estuarine) may distinguish the impoundments and drive species differences, while flow into an impoundment is correlated with zooplankton diversity and abundance.

A total of 7 163 fish larvae, representing 105 taxa and 53 families, was collected throughout the study period. The dominant families were the Engraulidae and Gobiidae representing 50% and 37% of the total catch, respectively. The most abundant larvae were those of the thorny anchovy, Stolephorus holodon, and an unidentified goby, Gobiid 12 (32% and 30% of the total catch, respectively). Estuarine-associated taxa dominated the total catch in terms of density (61%), with 11 out of the 28 taxa being totally dependent on estuaries at some stage in their life cycle. Turbidity and temperature were significant variables accounting for 27% of the variation in larval densities of estuarine-dependent species. The main peak in larval density occurred in January 1992 (summer) with a mean larval density of 160 larvae per 100 m3. Larvae of estuarine-associated taxa were predominantly at the flexion and postflexion developmental stages. Since larval densities of certain estuarine-associated species were significantly greater in bottom samples and on flood tides, it is suggested that selective tidal stream transport is a recruitment mechanism used by these species.

The unstructured-grid tidal-turbine model was first applied to investigate the effects of different tidal farm configurations on tidal energy extraction and the effects on the system flow field as well as biogeochemical transport processes in an idealized bay with a narrow channel connecting to the coastal ocean. Model results indicated that a large number of turbines are required to extract the maximum tidal energy and cause significant reduction in the volume flux. Model results also showed that tidal energy extraction has a greater effect on flushing time than on volume flux reduction. In the idealized tidal channel, a 10% reduction of volume flux caused by tidal energy extraction would result in an approximately 50% increase in flushing time in the bay. The flushing time increases exponentially as a function of flow reduction. A water-quality model simulation was conducted to investigate the dynamic effect of tidal energy extraction on water quality in a stratified tidal channel and estuary system. Model results showed that deployment of tidal turbines in the channel would increase vertical mixing in the bay. However, extraction of tidal energy also would result in a decrease in bottom dissolved oxygen in the bay during summer, which may cause hypoxia in fish. Finally, the tidal-turbine model was applied to a real-world site in Puget Sound a highly energetic estuary on the US Pacific Northwest coast. The model application of tidal energy extraction in Puget Sound demonstrated the advantage of using an unstructured-grid modeling approach with high grid resolution near the tidal-turbine farm within a large model domain. This study showed that a numerical model can be a useful tool for assessing tidal energy extraction and its environmental impacts and for informing regulatory and policy processes for tidal energy development.",,,,,"35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2016JUN 19-24, 2016","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4997-2,,,,,,,,,"Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Seattle, WA 98109 USA",,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000393090900006,,

In this research, we model the impact that such exploitation would have on the dynamics of headland sand banks. Such sand banks, formed by the large eddies generated by strong tidal flow past headlands, have an important role in natural coastal protection, since they cause waves to refract and dissipate energy. Therefore, a tidal energy converter (TEC) array developed in the vicinity of a headland could alter this natural form of coastal protection. Here, we investigate the impact of TEC array operation on idealised headland sand bank formation, followed by a case study, the Alderney Race: a strait of water between the island of Alderney (Channel Islands) and Cap de la Hague (France). This is achieved through the application of a morphological model that incorporates TEC device operation as an additional bed friction source term in the three-dimensional hydrodynamic module. Through a series of model experiments, we demonstrate the impact that a full-scale (300 MW) TEC array would have on sediment dynamics when sited near a headland. This modelling study demonstrates that a 300 MW TEC array located in the vicinity of a headland could lead to a considerable change in the maintenance of headland sand banks over a spring-neap cycle. If the scale of this change is demonstrated to be significant compared to the natural range of inter-annual and inter-seasonal sand bank variability, then developers of TEC arrays would be advised to examine ways in which they could reduce the environmental impacts of TEC arrays sited near headlands. The most obvious of these is to limit the scale of the array, but if we assume that developers wish to exploit the tidal energy resource to its maximum, the alternative is to site the array strategically (within the bounds of economic feasibility) such that it will not interfere with the natural morphodynamics of the headland system.

The Tidal Link is 41 Km long from its point of juncture with Kaddan Pateji Outfall Drain (KPOD) in the North-East up to Shah Samando Creek in the South-West. The vertical tidal range in the area is about 5 m. The tidal link was designed to carry about 3,118 cusecs of drainage waters. After completion of Tidal Link Drain, sea water intrusion and high erosion/sedimentation have been noticed at the tidal link and adjacent area due to changes in the hydraulic regime in the area. The devastation caused by tropical cyclone 2A in May, 1999 in the Indus delta has also created some drastic morphological changes in the area. This physical process creates breaches in the Tidal link drain between RD-30 and RD-125. These openings allow free exchange of water between the tidal link drain, Dhands and the Rann of Kutch.The analysis of tidal behavior, tidal current measurements and water samples collected in the study area shows that a small tidal creek type system of drainage channels has now been developed in Cholri Dhand and this system of channels is now used to flush water during ebb tide from surrounding Dhands of LBOD through Tidal Link Drain. It is observed that the LBOD can now be described as a New River that is forming an Estuary, which is an integral part of the creek system of the coastal area. The tidal link now acts as a tidal stream in which tidal fluctuations are very much visible and the sea water is now approaching the land. The main problem concerning the LBOD outfall is the increased hydraulic gradient due to seawater intrusion. The LBOD run parallel to the Indus River and discharges the saline water at the same level (sea level) in an active creek area of the Shah Samando Creek. The same altered hydraulic gradient creates very strong ebb currents in the region, which are responsible for making breaches in'the tidal link drain and erosion and accretion in the Dhands.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1019-8415,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Inst Oceanog, ST-47 Clifton,Block 1, Karachi, Pakistan",,,,2010-01-01,BCI:BCI201800253913,,

Similarities with wind power can cause errors of interpretation, especially when attempting to assess resource potential. The energy availability estimates that have been produced have, until now, only taken account of the apparent current flow speeds before the extraction of energy. As demonstrated in this paper, this may not be appropriate, especially for large energy extraction rates, which alter the underlying hydraulic nature of the flow environment.

Total extracted power from the proposed installations during a spring ebb tide represents roughly 9% of the natural power in the deep section of the channel and 30% of the natural tidal dissipation in the turbine installation region. Due to this low level of extraction, turbine installations at the proposed transects result in relatively minor differences in the tidal current magnitude (2.5%), water level (0.8%) Sedirnent flux (0.6%), and bed level (9%) Computations also indicate that the Proposed installation generates minimal impacts to the tidal harmonics (3.3% change in amplitude and 1-min delay in Phase) and tide-induced depth-averaged residual currents (2.8%).

Of marine renewable energy sources, tidal power has inherent predictability and large theoretical potential, estimated to exceed 8000 (TW h)a(-1) in coastal basins. Coastal sites in the vicinity of an island near a landmass are prime candidates for tidal stream power exploitation by arrays of turbines. This paper characterizes numerically the upper limit to power extraction of turbines installed at such sites. It is demonstrated that the maximum power extracted from the strait is generally not well approximated by either the power dissipated naturally at the seabed or the undisturbed kinetic power of flow in the strait. An analytical channel model [C. Garrett and P. Cummins, The power potential of tidal currents in channels, Proc. R. Soc. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci., vol. 461, no. 2060, pp. 2563-2572, Aug. 2005] provides lower predictions than the present numerical model of available power in the strait due to the analytical model not accounting for changes to the driving head resulting from power extraction and flow diversion offshore of the island. For geometrically long islands extending parallel to the landmass, the numerically predicted extracted power is satisfactorily approximated by the power naturally dissipated at the seabed, and there is reasonable agreement with the estimate by the channel analytical model. It is found that the results are sensitive to choice of boundary conditions used for the coastlines, the eddy viscosity, and bed friction. Increased offshore depth and lower blockage both reduce the maximum power extracted from the strait. The results indicate that power extracted from the site can be maximum if extraction is implemented both in the strait and offshore of the island. Presence of the landmass and increasing island dimensions both enhance power extraction. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The ultimate goal is to make wave energy a reliable and cost-effective source of large-scale, grid-quality, clean power. Mathematical optimization models and techniques will be developed and used to design so-called wave farms. In addition, the wave energy conversion (WEC) devices that constitute these wave farms can be connected via sensor networks, which allows dynamic operation of the WECs, allowing for solutions that are not only cost-effective but also robust with respect to changes in the sea environment. The academic/industry partnership between Lehigh University and Ocean Power Technologies (OPT) will give the research strong potential to be applied in practice, helping the U.S. take the lead in research and implementation of wave energy conversion. The main objective of this award is to develop novel optimization models and algorithms for designing and operating arrays of WEC devices. The investigators will advance the state of the art in modeling and optimizing strategic problems in the layout of arrays of WECs (also known as wave farms). The project will consider both deterministic sea environments (for which there are still many open questions) and stochastic wave environments (which will initiate a new body of research). Models and algorithms to optimize the locations of WECs within a wave farm array, which can have a significant impact on the total power of the farm due to the hydrodynamic interactions among the WECs, will be developed. A second goal of the project is to optimize the types and locations of sensors that collect data on waves and forecast the actual waveforms at the WECs, thus improving the control of the WECs. The research team will develop models and algorithms for maximum-likelihood estimation of wave realizations as a function of sensor system design, and then optimize the design itself with respect to the types and locations of sensors.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1400164,,,,,,,,Lehigh University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13520387,,

Part of assessing risks is quantifying the extent to which the foraging distributions of deep-diving seabirds overlap with the potential locations of devices in the large tidal pass habitats favoured for array installations (spatial overlap). Shore-based surveys using single vantage points and extensive grid systems to record the locations of foraging birds are often used in large tidal passes. Here, an application of these methods in the Fall of Warness (FOW), Orkney, UK are used to evaluate their effectiveness for quantifying and statistically analysing spatial overlap in large tidal passes. Whilst it was possible to quantify and statistically analyse spatial overlap using the methods evaluated here, viable statistical analysis required data sacrifices through the use of presence rather than abundance data. Moreover, comparisons between simultaneous shore-based and boat-based surveys, which are assumed to represent an accurate method, showed that sightings in the former were biased towards non-turbine microhabitats. This shore-based survey bias reflected low detection rates of foraging birds in fast unidirectional currents away from coastlines. Therefore, the methods evaluated here are unsuitable for quantifying and statistically analysing spatial overlap in large tidal passes. It is suggested that future shore-based surveys should overcome aforementioned issues by using several vantage points spread throughout large tidal passes, and comparing species use of neighbouring turbine and non-turbine microhabitats at reasonable distances to the vantage points (<2 km) during favourable sea states ( Beaufort Scale < 3). It is hoped that these recommendations lead to the development of standardised shore-based survey methods, providing comparable measurements of spatial overlap across tidal passes earmarked for array deployments: a key step towards estimations of collision risks at population levels.

The HYCOM model is forced with astronomical tides and surface winds alone, and therefore is particularly suitable to assess the tidal current and wind-driven current contribution to in-stream energy resources. We find two areas within the Gulf of California, one in the Great Island Region and one in the Upper Gulf of California, where peak spring tidal flows reach speeds of 1.1 m per second. Second to fifth-generation tidal stream devices would be suitable for deployment in these two areas, which are very similar in terms of tidal in-stream energy resources. However, they are also very different in terms of sediment type and range in water depth, posing different challenges for in-stream technologies. The highest mean TPD value when excluding TPDs equal or less than 50 W m(-2) (corresponding to the minimum velocity threshold for energy production) is of 172.8 W m(-2), and is found near the town of San Felipe, at (lat lon) = (31.006-114.64); here energy would be produced during 39.00% of the time. Finally, wind-driven currents contribute very little to the mean TPD and the total AEP.

The simulation results indicated that the reduction of water current velocity occurred at the installation area of MCTs. A certain amount of MCTs installed vertically to the water flow could achieve full utilization of marine renewable energy.

An underwater sound model was developed to simulate sound propagation from marine and hydrokinetic energy (MHK) devices or offshore wind (OSW) energy platforms. Finite difference methods were developed to solve the 3-D Helmholtz equation for sound propagation in the coastal environment. A 3-D sparse matrix solver with complex coefficients was formed for solving the resulting acoustic pressure field. The complex shifted Laplacian preconditioner (CSLP) method was applied to solve the matrix system iteratively with Message Passing Interface (MPI) parallelization using a high-performance cluster. The sound model was then coupled with the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) for simulating sound propagation generated by human activities, such as construction of OSW turbines or tidal stream turbine operations, in a range-dependent setting. As a proof of concept, the validation of the solver is tested with an ideal case against two other methods, and its application is then presented for two coastal wedge problems.

Second Narrows restricts the movement of marine traffic into the upper harbour because of its strong tidal streams, limited depth and the presence of both a vehicular bridge and a rail bridge. The Port of Vancouver undertook a joint project with the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS), CN Rail and terminal operators in the upper harbour to replace the present system of predicted water levels and currents with an on-site measurement system at the rail bridge. Water levels and currents are measured at the Narrows; bridge and draft clearances are calculated and the results telemetered to the Port management and traffic control centre for real-time display.Current data are provided by an Acoustic Scintillation Flow Meter (ASFM), manufactured by ASL Environmental Sciences Inc. of Sidney, BC. Water level data are provided by an Aquatrak sensor manufactured by Bartex of Annapolis, MD. Currents are measured at two depths, and water level at one point under the bridge, every 5 minutes. The display shows a 24-hour history of currents at both levels, and the measured water level (the full data history is also stored). The current data show significant departures from the predicted tidal flows as, to a lesser extent, do the water level data.The system has operated in a trial mode for the past two years to assess its operational reliability.

Geomagnetic cues are thought to guide long-range navigation, while visual or olfactory cues allow animals to pinpoint precise locations, but the complete behavioral sequence is not yet understood. Terra Ceia Bay is a primary nursery area for blacktip sharks, Carcharhinus limbatus, on southwestern Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast. Young-of-theyear animals show strong fidelity to a specific home range in the northeastern end of the bay and rapidly return when displaced. Older juveniles demonstrate annual philopatry for the first few years, migrating as far south as the Florida Keys each fall, then returning to Terra Ceia Bay each spring. To examine the sensory cues used in homing, we captured neonate (53 weeks old) blacktip sharks from within their home range, fitted them with acoustic tags, and translocated them to sites 8km away in adjacent Tampa Bay and released them. Intact animals returned to their home range, within 34 h on average, and remained there. With olfaction blocked, fewer animals returned to their home range and they took longer to do so, 130 h on average. However, they did not remain there but instead moved throughout Terra Ceia Bay and in and out of Tampa Bay. Since sharks from both treatments returned at night in tannic and turbid water, vision is likely not playing a major role in navigation by these animals. The animals in this study also returned on incoming or slack tides, suggesting that sharks, like many other fish, may use selective tidal stream transport to conserve energy and aid navigation during migration. Collectively, these results suggest that while other cues, possibly geomagnetic and/or tidal information, might guide sharks over long distances, olfactory cues are required for recognizing their specific home range.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,20,0,25,,,1540-7063,1557-7023,,,,,,,,,,"Mote Marine Lab, Sensory Biol & Behav Program, Sarasota, FL 34236 USANew Coll Florida, Div Nat Sci, Sarasota, FL 34243 USAMote Marine Lab, Behav Ecol & Physiol Program, Sarasota, FL 34236 USAMote Marine Lab, Ctr Shark Res, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA",,,,2015-09-01,WOS:000360006000014,26173711,

The present study provides mean vertical profiles of the velocity, the turbulence intensity and the integral lengthscale along the streamwise, spanwise and vertical direction of the tidal current. Based on our results and considering a tidal-stream energy convertor (TEC) aligned with the current main direction, the main elements of turbulence prone to affect the structure (material fatigue) and to alter power generation would likely be: (i) the streamwise turbulence intensity (I-x), (ii) the shear stress, vw ' , (iii) the normal stress, u' 2 and (iv) the vertical integral lengthscale (L-z).

This paper presents results of an interface testing programme of chalk-steel interfaces carried out utilising a computer-controlled interface shear tester under constant normal stress conditions against steel of different roughness. Results indicate that interface strength is significantly affected by the normal stress applied, as interface strength degrades for normal stress levels in excess of 30% of the chalk's tensile strength (similar to 300 kPa). Large-displacement tests revealed a tendency of the ultimate interface frictional resistance to drop to values very similar to that of the basic chalk-chalk interface at normal stresses up to 300 kPa, whereas substantial additional degradation was noticed for normal stresses above 700 kPa. At low normal stresses and displacements the behaviour of the chalk-steel interface was captured by an alpha type approach related to the rock unconfined compressive strength, which has been developed for other higher strength rock types.",,,,,,,,,8,1,0,0,0,0,9,,,1353-2618,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Dundee, Civil Engn, Dundee, ScotlandUniv Aberdeen, Dept Civil Engn, Aberdeen, ScotlandLloyds Register EMEA, Aberdeen, Scotland",Lloyds Register EMEA,,,2017-06-01,WOS:000400991300009,,

Landings per unit effort are currently used to approximate the state of stock and to trigger catch restrictions, but, although decisive in interpreting unit catches or landings, factors affecting catch rates are rarely understood. Using data from two long-term (1997-2010) scientific surveys conducted in autumn and winter, respectively, in the southern North Sea and from a vertically resolving stow net deployed at two stations in the German Wadden Sea (2005-2007), we investigate the effects of season, reproductive state, size, tidal state, daylight, and water depth on catch rates of brown shrimp. Log-linear random intercept models revealed an influence of all factors examined on the catch rate. Depth had a clear effect on the composition of size and reproductive state, supporting the hypothesis that brown shrimp utilize selective tidal stream transport to migrate to depths preferred during certain periods within their life cycle. The vertical distribution of brown shrimp across the water column revealed that on average two thirds to three quarters of the brown shrimps were located above reach of the standard shrimp catching gear Our findings indicate that multiple factors and interactions affect catch rates of brown shrimp and, thus, need to be accounted for when interpreting unit catches or landings for management purposes.

The data set contained data on numerical density of individuals, annual rates of weight growth, recruitment, survival, and secondary production. At higher densities (>400 ind. m(-2)), we found reductions of growth rate and recruitment. At the highest densities, the reduction in weight growth was so strong that production was lower than its maximal values at intermediate densities. This optimal density of around 400 ind. m(-2) was considered to represent the carrying capacity of the system for suspension-feeding bivalves. High densities resulting in reduced production, however, rarely (in only 5 % of the years) occurred over the 40 yr monitoring period. Clear bottom-up limitation of bivalve production was thus very unusual in the studied area. Year-to-year variation in growth and production of suspension-feeding bivalves were not related to chlorophyll concentrations in the main tidal stream and did not follow the declining long-term trends of primary production and chlorophyll concentrations. The main conclusion of the paper is that production increases with stock size, but only to a certain threshold value that is rarely reached as a consequence of recruitment being curtailed by a top-down process (predation on young stages).",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,0,5,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Coastal Syst, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, NetherlandsUniv Utrecht, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands",,,,2020-04-06,WOS:000521168400004,,

Recent development has been in biomass, geothermal, wind, and solar PV, though little attention has been given to the potential of marine energy resources. The present paper carries out an analysis of the economic viability of this resource using real wave and tidal current data. The results show that marine energy technologies could be cost-effective at several locations in Japan, and can pragmatically add reliable and predictable power to the energy generation mix. Deployed in straits with strong tidal flows near large population centers in western Japan, SeaGen and Verdant-type tidal turbines are shown to operate at costs far below the current price of electricity in the country. In northern Japan, the Aquabuoy, Pelamis, WaveDragon, and Guarda-type Oscillating Water Column Wave Energy Converters show costs near the current price of electricity. Even though Aquabuoy and Pelamis are now defunct, it is likely that in the future new generation wave energy converters would be able to produce electricity at even lower costs and further enhance the practicality of developing wave power in northern Japan.

The potential for energy generation by hydrokinetic tidal stream turbines is well accepted and the predictability of the resource is a significant benefit that will facilitate integration into the wider electricity system. Tidal stream energy offers an as yet largely untapped source of renewable energy; global resources are estimated at 100 to 500 TWh/yr, with around 20 TWh/yr estimated to be within the UK's waters. Various commercial tidal stream systems are under development with most emphasis on design and control of individual turbines. There has been some cascade of knowledge and technology from the wind energy industry. Turbines are typically 15-20 m in diameter, rated capacity 1-2 MW at flow speeds of around 2-3 m/s, and designed to be deployed in flows of up to 40 m depth. Over the next few years the first small scale tidal stream turbine arrays, 5-20 MW each, are planned to be deployed in France and the UK.However, significant improvements in performance, reliability, deployability, maintainability and thus economic viability are needed if tidal stream energy is to be deployed at a sufficiently large scale to contribute to commercial electricity markets. This requires that power output per MW installed is increased, expenditure per MW installed and the risk of cost variations are reduced. Installation costs are both high and extremely variable, with current cost estimated at £200/MWh reducing to £120/MWh accounting for future economies in scale production and deployment.The, sometimes implicit, assumption, and basis for current tidal farm proposals, is that turbines will be installed on individual seabed mountings in an underwater wind turbine style farm with turbines positioned to minimally interact with each other. Motivated by the necessity to dramatically improve the economic viability of tidal installations, this proposal will challenge these assumptions and seek revolutionary new solutions in the form of closely coupled turbine arrays using constructive interference effects to enhance array performance. It is known that there is a potential uplift in performance of up to 35% available through arraying turbines in a multi-rotor fence that partially spans the width of a much wider channel (Nishino & Willden 2012). This fellowship will seek to develop the underlying science, engineering tools and rotor designs required to deliver this significant performance uplift and the inferred expected reduction in cost of energy of circa 10-20%. A combination of analytic, numerical and experimental activities will be used to deliver the understanding, engineering tools and design guidelines for turbines designed to operate in confined tidal channels, multi-rotor tidal fences incorporating mutual constructive interference effects, high speed rotors, design against cavitation, and flow and pitch control strategies.This fellowship will involve close and sustained engagement with both the academic and industrial marine energy communities, internationally as well as within the UK. Academic engagement will be achieved through traditional publication means, journal articles, international conferences and workshops, as well as active participation in the UK academic marine energy network UKCMER, and in international academic collaborations. The resulting turbine technologies, engineering models and design guidelines will be developed in close cooperation with the tidal energy industry in order to maximise impact and accelerate the realization of commercial energy supply from tidal streams.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/R007322/1,,,,,,,,University of Oxford,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15360169,,

When the vertical migration period is an exact multiple of the tidal period then net unidirectional horizontal transport can occur. This happens most effectively in 'selective tidal-stream transport' for which vertical migration into the flow is specifically synchronized with the dominant (usually M(2)) tidal constituent. When migration and tide are not synchronized there is no net transport and, instead, a horizontal displacement oscillation of the organism takes place at the beat period between the vertical migration and tidal periods. The most common form of vertical migration is synchronized, not with the tide, but with the day-night cycle. Diel migration in M(2)-period tidal currents induces no net transport, but can produce excursions of several tens of kilometres over just a few days. Diel vertical migration can, however, interact with the sun-generated part of the semidiurnal tide to produce net horizontal transport, the direction of which is controlled by the phase of the S-2 tidal currents. The spatial distribution of phase implies that regions of horizontal convergence and divergence will result from diel migration. Diel migration in diurnal-period tides causes the preferred direction of transport to reverse at six-monthly intervals.",,,,,Meeting on Orientation and Migration in the SeaMeeting on Orientation and Migration in the Sea,"APR 18-21, 1994APR 18-21, 1994",MARINE BIOL ASSOC; SOC EXPTL BIOLMARINE BIOL ASSOC; SOC EXPTL BIOL,"PLYMOUTH, ENGLANDPLYMOUTH, ENGLAND",39,1,1,0,13,0,43,,,0025-3154,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1995-02-01,WOS:A1995QL63300002,,

The distribution of heavy metals in sediments, in seawater column and respective particulate matter, as well in the soft tissues of the molluscs, was determined. Both cluster analysis and linear discriminant analysis were used to discriminate the sediments. With regard to the heavy metal contents, the environmental quality of all sites is satisfying for the sediment-dwelling organisms. The particulate matter reflects the sediment composition, whereas the heavy metal concentration in soft tissues of the clams reflects the composition of the seawater column. The molluscs accumulate heavy metals in hepatopancreatic tissues: this tendency changes for different metals, and is highest for cadmium. The duality of the interface sediment-water is conditioned by the productivity of the hatcheries. The organic carbon amount in sediments depends on both productivity and tidal streams: so, the hydrology of this area is a very important factor in determining the environmental quality of the lagoon.",,,,,2nd National Symposium on Environmental Chemistry2nd National Symposium on Environmental Chemistry,"SEP 18-20, 1996SEP 18-20, 1996","Italian Chem Soc, Div Environm Chem; Univ Bologna; CNRItalian Chem Soc, Div Environm Chem; Univ Bologna; CNR","RIMINI, ITALYRIMINI, ITALY",8,0,0,0,4,0,8,,,0003-4592,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Sci Chim, I-34127 Trieste, ItalyLab Biol Marina, I-34100 Trieste, Italy",Lab Biol Marina,,,1997-11-01,WOS:000071667100007,,

To understand the ecological and behavioural mechanisms of their inshore migration in tropicalAnguilla, systematic research on their periodicity of inshore migration was conducted for 24 h over 9 to 13 consecutive days before and after the new moon dates four times in one year. Glass eel (juvenile) collections (151 to 4371 specimens during each survey period) in the Poigar River, north Sulawesi Island, Indonesia indicated a lunar periodicity, in which peak recruitment continued for 2 to 4 days during the new moon period; then, the recruitment sharply decreased before and after the new moon. Daily glass eel migration occurred in two peaks during the ebb (20:00) and flood (02:00) tides, while there was no significant different glass eel recruitment between the flood tide and ebb tides. Although the selective tidal stream transport that glass eels utilize during the flood tide for recruitment is widely accepted to be the main mechanism of inshore migration behaviour through estuaries to freshwater habitats for temperate glass eels, we did not find this mechanism during this study. These results suggest that the main recruitment mechanism for tropical glass eels may be associated with both endogenous rhythms (biological clock) and exogenous factors (tidal orientation) in the study site. The rhythmic activity of migrating tropical glass eels found in this study also contributes not only to understanding the biological and ecological implications but also provides clues for stock management and conservation ofAnguilla, which have been critically declining in recruitment worldwide in recent decades.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,,,0378-1909,1573-5133,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Brunei Darussalam, Environm & Life Sci Programme, Fac Sci, Jalan Tungku Link, BE-1410 Gadong, BruneiIndonesian Inst Sci, Res Ctr Oceanog, Jakarta 14430, IndonesiaSintuwu Maroso Univ, Poso 94619, IndonesiaUniv Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan",Sintuwu Maroso Univ,,,2020-09-24,WOS:000568459500002,,

Ten minute averages of tidal current speed and elevation data were collected for 18 days at an on-bank site ( < 7 m water depth) and an off-bank site (< 10 m). These data were compared to data collected simultaneously from two shelf locations (< 11 m) occupied to measure regional tidal behaviour. Overall C-D estimates at the on- and off-bank sites attained 7.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(-3) and 6.6 +/- 0.1 x 10(-3), respectively. On-bank C-D estimates also differed between the predominant east-west tidal streams, with easterly directed flows experiencing CD =7.8 +/- 0.18 x 10(-3) and westerly directed flows C-D=6.4 +/- 0.12 x 10(-3). Statistically significant differences between the off-bank and on-bank sites are attributed to the large form drag exerted by the sand banks on the regional tidal currents, and statistically significant differences between the westward and eastward flows is ascribed to bedform asymmetry. Form drag from the large bedforms in Torres Strait comprises up to 65% of the total drag coefficient. When constructing sediment transport models, different C-D estimates must therefore be applied to shelf regions containing steep bedforms compared to regions that do not. Our results extend the limited inventory of seabed drag coefficients for shallow shelf environments, and can be used to improve existing regional seabed mobilisation models, which have direct application to environmental management in Torres Strait.

Locally, erosion of these deposits is impeded by a lag gravel pavement that occupies much of the 150-350 m deep central strait. The same strong currents effectively transport bedload along the Wellington continental shelf, which is a rocky platform with a patchy veneer of mobile sand and gravel. Outside the main tidal stream, within semiprotected embayments, deposition is manifest by prominent sediment bodies of mud and sand prograding across the inner-middle shelf. Seaward of the shelf, in southern Cook Strait, the seafloor is dissected by a complex of submarine canyons that appear to syphon off tidally transported sand to the nearby Hikurangi Trough. However, in at least one place, transport is impeded by a slide blocking the canyon axis. Outside submarine canyons, products of gravitational mass movement are not conspicuous, even though Cook Strait lies across a zone of high seismicity.

These distinctive LOI signatures we used in conjunction with radiocarbon dates and Delaware's local relative sea-level curve to reconstruct the Holocene history of the valleys of the study ares. During the early Holocene, the sediment yield of the Delaware coastal plain was too low for rivers to build extensive subaerially exposed floodplains. Instead, organic-rich muds and peat accumulated in perennially inundated, non-tidal palustrine wetlands. These environments existed as long ago as 11,000 YBP, well before any possible influence of sea-level rise. The elevation of these deposits and Delaware's sea-level history suggest that tidal influence began 1,000-2,000 years ago. The transition from fluvial to estuarine conditions occurs without any lithologic change or discontinuity near the top of a uniform palustrine peat. Therefore, the base of the Holocene transgressive sequence is conformable in these valleys except where lateral migration by tidal streams has subsequently removed the conformable transition. Outside of the valleys, however, the base of the transgressive sequence is a major unconformity. Thus, the transgressive sequence preserved landward of the Delaware Bay coast is bounded at its base by a complex stratigraphic surface which is primarily conformable in valley fills but which is unconformable on paleointerfluves.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,0,13,,,0749-0208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1992-09-01,WOS:A1992KX28800008,,

The abiotic component of the classification was based on a geomorphological shoreline classification acquired from low level aerial video, fetch (wave exposure) estimates, as well as salinity, temperature, and current velocity predicted from a hydrodynamic model. The biotic component of the classification was based on in situ field sampling of 39 sites using a published sampling methodology. The inter-relationships between community and habitat were first explored using the two-way indicator species analysis (Twinspan) to define communities and functional groups, and then with regression tree models to determine what combinations of abiotic variables were necessary to support the communities identified by Twinspan. This methodology is predictive, and can be used to quantitatively model the occurrence of biological communities based on abiotic data. The classification presented here is composed of two parts. The first part clustered site by species data collected at 39 sites in the study area using Twinspan. Seven community types were identified by Twinspan. Using an exploratory technique termed tree-based regression, these community types were used as response variables, while abiotic data were used as predictors. The regression tree model predicted seven intertidal biotopes with an accuracy of 72%. Binary decision tree rules produced from the model were used to attach biotopes to the remainder of the 1486 km of shoreline in the study area. Results indicate that this methodology is an effective technique for assessing the broad scale biological composition of large areas of shoreline. This method will be used to assist in the identification of representative, distinct, and rare communities at scales consistent with the identification of conservation importance for site protection and management. It is expected that this methodology will be applied to the remaining 29 000 km of shoreline on Canada's Pacific coast in the near future. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The experiments were conducted in a cavitation tunnel used to test marine propellers, with the same similarity laws as are used for a marine propeller. The cavitation patterns were observed at conditions corresponding to pre-stall, stall, and poststall stream speeds as well as for two different depths of submergence of the turbine shaft to simulate the static presence of waves. The noise levels of the turbine were measured at the same conditions as the cavitation tests. The experimental results show that the turbine can experience strong unstable sheet and cloud cavitations as well as strong tip vortex cavitation at a shallow depth of shaft submergence which can be imposed by a wave trough taking place over the turbine. It is also shown that the measured noise level of the turbine is further increased due to the presence of cavitation. Finally, the slipstream wash was measured in terms of field velocities in the wake and surrounding of the turbine, and results show the slipstream wash may have an impact on the seabed if a turbine is positioned too close to it.",,,,,,,,,54,3,0,0,1,0,58,,,0957-6509,2041-2967,,,,,,,,,,"Newcastle Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",,,,2007-03-01,WOS:000246281500010,,

We investigated, at high temporal resolution, whether overestimation of planktonic abundances and/or deviations of megalopal responses from the conceptual model were responsible for such decoupling. Daily settlement of megalopae was analyzed using regression and spectral analyses to identify periodicities and correlated with tidal amplitude. Hydrological parameters and supply, net flux and hourly concentration of megalopae in the plankton were addressed as, factors influencing short, intermediate and long-term settlement, through 50 h sampling series. Supply and surface net flux levels of megalopae were similar and clearly decoupled from settlement on bottom-deployed collectors. Both hourly planktonic concentration and settlement patterns of megalopae fitted the conceptual model at high temporal resolution, with some deviations in terms of light intensity influences.

The Inner Sound of Stroma in particular has attracted significant commercial interest. To understand potential environmental impacts of the installation of a tidal turbine array a case study based upon the Inner Sound is considered. A numerical computational fluid dynamics model, Fluidity, is used to conduct a series of depth-averaged simulations to investigate velocity and bed shear stress changes due to the presence of idealised tidal turbine arrays. The number of turbines is increased from zero to 400. It is found that arrays in excess of 85 turbines have the potential to affect bed shear stress distributions in such a way that the most favourable sites for sediment accumulation migrate from the edges of the Inner Sound towards its centre. Deposits of fine gravel and coarse sand are indicated to occur within arrays of greater than 240 turbines with removal of existing deposits in the shallower channel margins also possible. The effects of the turbine array may be seen several kilometres from the site which has implications not only on sediment accumulation, but also on the benthic fauna. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Recent research has shown that marine mammals often make use of tidally energetic locations for foraging, yet data are generally limited to observations of animals at the water surface. Such areas are also of interest to the renewable energy industry for the deployment of tidal-stream energy turbines; this has led to concerns about potential impacts on marine mammals. Methods for measuring animal movements underwater are limited; however, active sonar can image marine mammals and could potentially measure three-dimensional movements in tidally energetic locations. Here, a dual 720 kHz sonar system was developed to investigate the three-dimensional movements of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) in a tidally energetic channel. Estimated mean depth (distance from the surface) of seals was 12.0 m (95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 11.6-12.4 m), and the majority of time was spent at the surface and at approximately 10-12 m distance from the surface. When expressed as distances from the sea bed, mean distance was 18.5 m (95% CI: 18.0-18.9 m), and the majority of time was spent at 14 m from the sea bed. Seal movements were generally in the same direction as the tidal flow with mean horizontal speeds of between 0.51 and 3.13 m s(-1) (95% CIs = 1.24-1.54 m s(-1)). Mean vertical velocities (where negative and positive values represent a descent and ascent respectively) for each seal track ranged between -1.76 and +0.88 m s(-1) (95% CIs: -0.23 to +0.03 m s(-1)). These results provide a basis for understanding how seals utilize a dynamic tidal environment and suggest that harbour seal behaviour can be markedly different to less tidally energetic habitats. The results also have important implications for the prediction of risk associated with interactions between diving seals and tidal turbines in these dynamic habitats.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,0,10,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,,,,,,,"Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, ScotlandTritech Int Ltd, Westhill, Aberdeen, ScotlandSMRU Consulting, New Technol Ctr, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",Tritech Int LtdSMRU Consulting,,,2019-05-15,WOS:000465962300006,,

Evidence suggests that marine management and conservation strategies, whether directed towards the environment or fisheries, are only slowly taking account of the time-scales of endogenously controlled rhythmic animal behaviour as a basis from which to achieve their objectives. Similarly, in commercial aquaculture practices, there is a need for greater evaluation of the role of photoperiod manipulation and optimization of feeding regimes against the background of the endogenous rhythmicity of the organisms concerned.

Initial trials using vertically suspended sisal ropes placed in the intertidal gave an indication of the importance of the orientation of the collectors to the direction of the tidal stream. Rotatable and cylindrical collectors, using a polyester petticoat gauze as a settlement substrate, were subsequently designed to function independently of the direction of the tidal current. The location and intensity of larval attachment to artificial collectors and naturally occurring filamentous substrates varied greatly. Settling intensity was closely correlated with the length of the current vector to which the collector was exposed and/or to its height in the water column. Two main settlement seasons were apparent: the first from late May to early August, and a second, shorter and with lower abundance, in late September into October. Settlement on the collectors and subtidal hydroids during winter provides field evidence for the ability of larvae to delay metamorphosis, and suggests their presence throughout the year. Length-frequency distributions of plantigrades from the collectors were comparable to those found attached to natural filamentous substrates over the same period. The substrate choices observed during this study confirm that plantigrades preferentially attach to filamentous substrates, and subsequently migrate onto pitted and creviced hard surfaces.",,,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,30,1,37,,,1385-1101,,,,,,,,,,,"INST MEERESKUNDE,D-24105 KIEL,GERMANY",INST MEERESKUNDE,,,1996-12-01,WOS:A1996WJ37700008,,

The need for exploring alternative, environmental-friendly, and renewable energy resources has therefore become more foreseeable.Tidal power is the clean and white energy technology, which is available at no fuel cost and minimal running cost. The coastline of Pakistan, which is about 1,045 km long with dominant features, is the best resource for harnessing tidal energy. The tidal energy resources present in the oceans are of much higher density and better reliability than any other renewable for the likely future. Though tidal power is predictable and available in the form of blocks of energy, it may not solve the energy crisis, but can decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. It can spread our energy resources and meet stringent greenhouse gas emission targets.The chapter presents the assessment of tidal power harnessing technologies and selection of suitable technology for Pakistan.

We applied logistic regression to quantify how the biotic integrity of streams at a local scale is affected by cumulative effects resulting from catchment land uses, point sources, and nearby transmission line rights-of-way. Indicators for land use were developed from the remote sensing National Land Cover Data and applied at different scales. We determined that the risk of local impairment in nontidal streams rapidly increases with increased urban land use in the catchment area. The average likelihood of failing biocriteria doubled with every 10% points increment in urban land, thus an increase in urban land use from 0 to 20% quadruples the risk of impairment. For the basins evaluated in this study, catchments with more than 40-50% urban land use had greater than 80% probability of failing biocriteria, on average.

However, these structures can impact on aquatic communities by disrupting connectivity and altering physical habitat conditions. Complete removal is rarely feasible in the short-term because of the competing flood mitigation and land use interests. However, in many cases it is likely that the structure and/or its operation can be modified to enhance connectivity for migratory species and reduce the severity of impacts on instream habitats.This study describes the results of a short-term trial investigating the effects of modified tide gate management on instream habitat and fish communities in a small tidal stream in the North Island of New Zealand. The study site was located upstream of the saline limit and thus does not directly address this potential limitation on managing the effects of some tide gates. The main objective of the study was to understand whether improvements in tidal flushing could mitigate the negative effects of tide gates on upstream habitats, thus improving their suitability for native fish communities.The trial demonstrated that in impacted lowland river reaches, the reintroduction of limited tidal exchange upstream of tide gates reduced negative impacts on instream habitat by restoring hydrological variability, increasing minimum dissolved oxygen concentrations and potentially also reducing water temperatures. However, it was also shown that the recovery may not be uniform and can be dependent on interactions with other stressors. The trial illustrated the potential for using modified tide gate management to mitigate the environmental effects associated with their operation, and to restore habitat conditions so that they are more favourable for the persistence of native fish species.

Exposure is calculated from simulation runs of the one-dimensional transport equation solved by an implicit finite difference method. Calibration was done for each episode by adjusting three conditions (runoff starting lime, duration, and flow) and a correction to the dispersion coefficient in order to match the continuously measured salinity transients. First-order rate constants used by the fate component were calculated from half-life valuer reported in the literature. Baseline scenarios for each episode and each pesticide were derived by using the same conditions obtained in the salinity reins and adjusting the pesticide loading in order to mimic the few data points of measured pesticide concentrations. In all baseline scenarios, pesticide concentration rises following the initial burst of runoff (also noticeable as an abrupt drop in salinity) and then oscillates, forced by the tidal cycle. These oscillations are dominated by transport, while fate imposes a secular decaying trend. Ten additional scenarios for each episode were obtained from the baseline scenario by randomly varying three pesticide load parameters (starting time and duration of runoff, and pesticide discharge) using a Latin hypercubes design. Two exposure metrics were calculated from the stimulated and the measured pesticide concentration: maximum and lime average, which was obtained by integrating the curve and dividing by the time period. The metrics calculated from the baseline runs are relatively close to the data-derived metrics, because the baseline runs attempted to mimic the data. For each one of the two metrics and all pesticide-episode combinations, several statistics of the set of 11 scenarios were also calculated: minimum and maximum, mid-range, mean, standard deviation, and median. The mean +/- standard deviation interval of the simulation-derived value consistently brackets the data-derived value for the maximum metric, but not for the time-average metric. This may indicate that even if the maximum value is correctly captured in the field sample, the time-average exposure could be in error when calculated directly from the field data due to undersampling of the pesticide time series. The methodology developed here attempts to reconstruct the possible exposure from the sparse sampling of the pesticide concentration during the runoff episodes; only when the number of field samples is high and regularly spaced is it possible to have confidence in the reconstruction of the curve. The shape of the curve cannot be inferred from the field measurements alone; as expected, tidal movement makes the pesticide concentration swing up and down. This result has important implications because the biological community would be subject to repetitive pulses of exposure to the chemicals.

The channel is characterised by strong currents with depth-averaged velocities exceeding 2 m s(-1). The model was successfully validated against harmonic analysis data and in situ flow measurements acquired with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). Annual estimates of power and energy output were derived, considering spatial and temporal variations in flow velocities and in power density both across and along the channel. The study confirms the relevance of integrating field information with numerical models to achieve a better estimation of tidal power potential through the water column. The accuracy of both bathymetric and tidal elevation data contributes greatly to validating the model; whereas validating the model results with 3D velocity patterns obtained using boat-mounted ADCPs allows peak velocity distributions along the water column and the spatial variation of velocity through different cross-sections to be considered, further assisting in the dynamic placement of tidal energy conversion devices adapted to different resource scenarios.

Traditionally, this has been pursed through riverine hydropower plants, with onshore wind systems growing steadily in popularity and importance over the years. Other renewable energy resources, which were previously not economically attractive or technically feasible for large scale exploitation, are now being considered to form a significant part of the energy mix. Amongst these, marine and in particular, tidal energy resource has become a serious candidate for undergoing mass exploitation in the near future, particularly in places with a tidal range of 4m or more. Tidal renewable energy systems are designed to extract the kinetic or potential energy flow and convert it into electricity. This can be achieved by placing tidal stream turbines in the path of high speed tidal currents or through tidal range schemes, where low head turbines are encapsulated in impoundment structures, much like in low head riverine hydropower schemes. It is thought that these systems, when implemented at scales required to generate substantial amounts of electricity, have the potential to significantly alter the tidal flow characteristics, which could have knock-on impacts on the hydro-environment. This review gathers together knowledge from different research areas to facilitate an evaluation of the potential hydro-environmental impacts of tidal renewable energy systems, with a particular focus on water quality. It highlights the relevance of hydro-environmental modelling in assessing potential impacts of proposed schemes and identifies areas where further research is needed. A case study is presented of recent modelling studies undertaken for the Severn Estuary. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Larval behavior has been shown to influence dispersal, but how to incorporate behavior effectively within dispersal models remains a challenge. Mechanisms of behavior are often derived from laboratory-based studies and therefore, may not reflect behavior in situ. Here, using state-of-the-art models, we explore the movements that larvae must undertake to achieve the vertical distribution patterns observed in nature. Results suggest that behaviors are not consistent with those described under the tidally synchronized vertical migration (TVM) hypothesis. Instead, we show (i) a need for swimming speed and direction to vary over the tidal cycle and (ii) that, in some instances, larval swimming cannot explain observed vertical patterns. We argue that current methods of behavioral parameterization are limited in their capacity to replicate in situ observations of vertical distribution, which may cause dispersal error to propagate over time, due to advective differences over depth and demonstrate an alternative to laboratory-based behavioral parameterization that encompasses the range of environmental cues that may be acting on planktic organisms.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,12,0,14,,,0027-8424,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Plymouth, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandMarine Syst Modelling Grp, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Liverpool L3 5DA, Merseyside, England",,,,2019-06-21,WOS:000471039700043,31123143,

All such developments interact with the seabed to some degree and so a key need exists for suitable methodology to monitor the impacts of large-scale Marine Renewable Energy Installations (MREIs). Many of these will be situated on mixed or rocky substrata, where conventional methods to characterise the habitat are unsuitable. Traditional destructive sampling is also inappropriate in conservation terms, particularly as safety zones around (MREIs) could function as Marine Protected Areas, with positive benefits for biodiversity. Here we describe a technique developed to effectively monitor the impact of MREIs and report the results of its field testing, enabling large areas to be surveyed accurately and cost-effectively. The methodology is based on a high-definition video camera, plus LED lights and laser scale markers, mounted on a flying array that maintains itself above the seabed grounded by a length of chain, thus causing minimal damage. Samples are taken by slow-speed tows of the gear behind a boat (200 m transects). The HD video and randomly selected frame grabs are analysed to quantify species distribution. The equipment was tested over two years in Lyme Bay, UK (25 m depth), then subsequently successfully deployed in demanding conditions at the deep (>50 m) high-energy Wave Hub site off Cornwall, UK, and a potential tidal stream energy site in Guernsey, Channel Islands (1.5 ms(-1) current), the first time remote samples from such a habitat have been achieved. The next stage in the monitoring development process is described, involving the use of Remote Operated Vehicles to survey the seabed post-deployment of MREI devices.

Measurements of suspended particle concentration and current velocities at each site during the deployments enabled horizontal particle fluxes to be calculated for periods corresponding to the sediment trap sampling intervals. These data have allowed the performance of the traps to be compared and the effect of the tidal environment on trap performance to be assessed under field conditions. In parallel deployments, different diameter cylindrical traps of similar aspect ratio (height/diameter) collected identical sample masses when corrected for the cross-section of trap aperture but conical traps collected only one-tenth of the material taken by the cylindrical traps. The sample collection rate of cylindrical traps was found to be positively related to the measured horizontal particle flux and this relationship was similar at both sites despite different tidal current strengths and a corresponding variation in the concentrations of suspended particles. Comparisons of the carbon content of ambient suspended particles with that of the samples collected by the traps indicated that the conical traps progressively under trapped carbon-rich particles as current velocity increased. These data confirm that the use of moored sediment traps in tidal waters, where horizontal particle fluxes greatly exceed vertical fluxes, is of limited value in the interpretation of suspended particle dynamics. However, using appropriate geometry for the collectors, sediments traps may provide representative samples of suspended particles for analysis. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In pursuing new energy sources, governments must put in place a clear and consistent national energy strategy that addresses the use of renewable energy sources as well as the environmentally sustainable use of traditional energy sources. The national energy strategy must also place a strong emphasis on energy conservation as well as emphasize integrated solutions, solutions that make use of the best available technologies and can be readily tailored to local requirements. Such solutions evolve as technologies change, and provide a wide range of choices to meet varying social, economic and environmental conditions. As these solutions evolve, so must the legislative framework evolve to ensure these solutions are developed and operated not only for the social and economic benefits they offer, but also to cater for their potential environmental impacts.

New approaches are needed to capture the relevant physics for small diameter cables on rocky seabeds to reduce the costs and risks of power transmission and increase operational reliability.This paper reports on subsea cables that MeyGen installed for Phase 1a of the Pentland Firth Inner Sound tidal stream energy project. These cables are located on rocky seabeds in an area where severe metocean conditions occur. ROV field observation of these cables shows them to be stable on the seabed with little or no movement occurring over almost all of the cable routes, despite conventional engineering methods predicting significant dynamic movement.We cite recent research undertaken by the University of Western Australia (UWA) to more accurately assess the hydrodynamic forces and geotechnical interaction of cables on rocky seabeds. We quantify the conformity between the cables and the undulating rocky seabed, and the distributions of cable seabed contact and spanning via simulations of the centimetric-scale seabed bathymetry. This analysis leads to calculated profiles of lift, drag and seabed friction along the cable, which show that all of these load and reaction components are modelled in an over-conservative way by conventional pipeline engineering techniques. Overall, our analysis highlights that current cable stability design can be unnecessarily conservative on rocky seabeds.

With potential for the manufacture of significant numbers of such devices there is a need to assess their environmental impact and, in particular, their life cycle energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) performance. This paper presents an analysis of the life cycle energy use and CO2 emissions associated with the first generation of Seagen turbines. The detailed assessment covers the embodied energy and CO2 in the materials and manufacturing of components, device installation, and operation along with those for decommissioning. With relatively conservative assumptions, and despite the early stage of development, the study shows that at 214 kJ/kWh and 15 gCO(2)/kWh, the respective energy and carbon intensities are comparable with large wind turbines and very low relative to the 400 to 1000 gCO(2)/kWh typical of fossil-fuelled generation. The energy payback period is approximately 14 months and the CO2 payback is around 8 months. The embodied energy and carbon show limited sensitivity to assumptions with environmental performance remains excellent even under the most adverse scenarios considered. Materials use is identified as the primary contributors to embodied energy and carbon with shipping also significant. Improvements in the environmental impact of the Seagen can be achieved primarily by increased structural efficiency and the use of alternative installation methods to increase recovery of steel at decommissioning.",,,,,,,,,99,2,0,0,6,0,109,,,1475-0902,2041-3084,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Edinburgh, Dept Engn & Elect, Edinburgh EH9 3JL, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000207602900001,,

However, for shellfish species that are sessile as adults, the larval-dispersal stage remains largely unresolved. Appreciation of larval connectivity is therefore crucial to population genetics and marine management. We describe a coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic and Lagrangian particle tracking model used to simulate larval transport and show how temporal and spatial hydrodynamic changes, together with larval behavior, are likely to affect dispersal. A case study of Irish Sea (United Kingdom) shellfish populations incorporates a wide range of hydrodynamic environments that are prevalent in other marine systems around the world. Our simulations tested two main processes that control larval dispersal: hydrodynamics and vertical migration. Simulated larval cohorts were released from estuaries and soft sediment locations in regions that were oceanographically distinct. Larvae originating from exposed areas could migrate offshore (low retention and high connectivity) and disperse farther than larvae that remained in flood-dominant estuaries, which promote retention. Simulated self-recruitment and connectivity with neighboring populations (similar to 50 km apart) were generally high, although well-developed mesoscale residual currents were important, controlling dispersal pathways offshore. Vertical migration strategies, synchronized either with the tide (tidal stream transport) or with the Earth's rotation (diel transport), enabled more larvae to remain close to the coast, and simulations indicated higher retention than for passive larvae. However, the probability of connectivity with other populations and potential survivorship was greater for tidal strategies than for passive (although passive transport populated more distinct areas albeit in smaller proportions, as more larvae remained stranded offshore), or diel, where larvae remained close to their release location.",,,,,,,,,77,1,0,0,63,0,86,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,,,,,,,"Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Ctr Appl Marine Sci, Menai Bridge, Anglesey, Wales",,,,2013-03-01,WOS:000317954300007,,

Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements of water currents adjacent to the fish monitoring site showed that the water column stratified into two vertical layers under certain tidal conditions, with an upper outflowing layer over a lower inflowing layer. Under strong flood or ebb conditions, most of the water column was, respectively, inflowing or outflowing.

The existing methods which are used to predict tidal movements perform very well for predicting water levels and slow moving currents, but often perform very badly on fast flowing tidal streams of the type in which we areinteresting in placing tidal turbines. This project will address this by applying methods from the machine learning community to the analysis of fast flowing tidal streams. This will produce an algorithm which will allow users from the oceanographic and tidal energy community to greatly improve the prediction of tidal currents at any point indefinitely far into the future. Thus a robustprediction of the performance of tidal stream turbines can be obtained.

The main objective of the developed controller is to follow a total wind farm power reference and to reduce the damage equivalent tower bending moments of the turbines in the wind farm. The novelty in the control approach is the use of an engineering model-based, linear wind farm operation model and a newly developed wind farm-scale wind turbine fatigue load model. The model predictive controller is compared with commonly used wind farm control approaches in two wind farm case studies using a dynamic wind farm simulation tool. The simulation results suggest that the proposed model predictive controller can reduce the sum of the equivalent tower bending moments of wind turbines in a wind farm during provision of ancillary services.

The NERC/DEFRA collaboration FLOWBEC-4D (Flow, Water column & Benthic Ecology 4D) is addressing the lack of knowledge of the environmental and ecological effects of installing and operating large arrays of wave and tidal energy devices. The FLOWBEC sonar platform combines a number of instruments to record information at a range of physical and multi-trophic levels. Data are recorded at a resolution of several measurements per second, for durations of 2 weeks to capture an entire spring-neap tidal cycle. An upward-facing multifrequency Simrad EK60 echosounder (38, 120 and 200 kHz) is synchronized with an upward-facing Imagenex 837B Delta T multibeam sonar (120 degrees x 20 degrees beamwidth, 260 kHz) aligned with the tidal flow. An ADV is used for local current measurements and a fluorometer is used to measure chlorophyll (as a proxy for plankton) and turbidity. The platform is self-contained with no cables or anchors, facilitating rapid deployment and recovery in highenergy sites and flexibility in allowing baseline data to be gathered.Five 2-week deployments were completed in 2012 and 2013 at wave and tidal energy sites, both in the presence and absence of renewable energy structures. These surveys were conducted at the European Marine Energy Centre, Orkney, UK. Algorithms for noise removal, target detection and target tracking have been written using a combination of LabVIEW, MATLAB and Echoview. Target morphology, behavior and frequency response are used to aid target classification, with concurrent shore-based seabird observations used to ground truth the acoustic data. Using this information, the depth preference and interactions of birds, fish schools and marine mammals with renewable energy structures can be tracked. Seabird and mammal dive profiles, predator-prey interactions and the effect of hydrodynamic processes during foraging events throughout the water column can also be analyzed. These datasets offer insights into how fish, seabirds and marine mammals successfully forage within dynamic marine habitats and also whether individuals face collision risks with tidal stream turbines.Measurements from the subsea platform are complemented by 3D hydrodynamic model data and concurrent shore-based marine X-band radar. This range of concurrent fine-scale information across physical and trophic levels will improve our understanding of how the fine-scale physical influence of currents, waves and turbulence at tidal and wave energy sites affect the behavior of marine wildlife, and how tidal and wave energy devices might alter the behavior of such wildlife. Together, the results from these deployments increase our environmental understanding of the physical and ecological effects of installing and operating marine renewable energy devices. These results can be used to guide marine spatial planning, device design, licensing and operation, as individual devices are scaled up to arrays and new sites are considered. The combination of our current technology and analytical approach can help to de-risk the licensing process by providing a higher level of certainty about the behavior of a range of mobile marine species in high energy environments. It is likely that this approach will lead to greater mechanistic understanding of how and why mobile predators use these high energy areas for foraging. If a fuller understanding and quantification can be achieved at single demonstration scales, and these are found to be similar, then the predictive power of the outcomes might lead to a wider strategic approach to monitoring and possibly lead to a reduction in the level of monitoring required at each commercial site.",,,,,Oceans ConferenceOceans Conference,"SEP 14-19, 2014SEP 14-19, 2014",,"St Johns, CANADASt Johns, CANADA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4799-4918-2,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen, ScotlandUniv Bath, Dept Phys, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, EnglandMarine Scotland Sci, Aberdeen, ScotlandNatl Oceanog Ctr, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",,,,2014-01-01,WOS:000369848800166,,

Tidal stream energy converters (turbines) are currently being installed in tidally energetic coastal sites. However, there is currently a high level of uncertainty surrounding the potential environmental impacts on marine mammals. This is a key consenting risk to commercial introduction of tidal energy technology. Concerns derive primarily from the potential for injury to marine mammals through collisions with moving components of turbines. To understand the nature of this risk, information on how animals respond to tidal turbines is urgently required.2. We measured the behaviour of harbour seals in response to acoustic playbacks of simulated tidal turbine sound within a narrow coastal channel subject to strong, tidally induced currents. This was carried out using data from animal-borne GPS tags and shore-based observations, which were analysed to quantify behavioural responses to the turbine sound.3. Results showed that the playback state (silent control or turbine signal) was not a significant predictor of the overall number of seals sighted within the channel.4. However, there was a localised impact of the turbine signal; tagged harbour seals exhibited significant spatial avoidance of the sound which resulted in a reduction in the usage by seals of between 11% and 41% at the playback location. The significant decline in usage extended to 500 m from the playback location at which usage decreased by between 1% and 9% during playback.5. Synthesis and applications. This study provides important information for policy makers looking to assess the potential impacts of tidal turbines and advise on development of the tidal energy industry. Results showing that seals avoid tidal turbine sound suggest that a proportion of seals encountering tidal turbines will exhibit behavioural responses resulting in avoidance of physical injury; in practice, the empirical changes in usage can be used directly as avoidance rates when using collision risk models to predict the effects of tidal turbines on seals. There is now a clear need to measure how marine mammals behave in response to actual operating tidal turbines in the long term to learn whether marine mammals and tidal turbines can coexist safely at the scales currently envisaged for the industry.",,,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,19,0,38,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, ScotlandUniv St Andrews, The Observatory, Ctr Res Ecol & Environm Modelling, St Andrews, Fife, ScotlandLoughborough Univ Technol, Loughborough, Leics, EnglandScottish Marine Inst Oban, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban, Argyll, Scotland",,,,2018-03-01,WOS:000424881800022,,

The results showed there was a higher revealed preference average value of 148 pound per person attributed to the area through the Travel Costs incurred by visitors than their stated preference average valuation of 6.70 pound per person from a willingness to pay CVM contribution. Interviewees were also asked about the potential impact renewable energy generation in the area would have on their visit. Visual aspects of developments and the impact of wave height reduction were queried in particular. Using these responses from interviewees, the influence of marine energy generation in the case study area and the impact on the value of the marine environment was analysed.The results show that only a small number of visitors, 3.5%, would be put off visiting the area again due to marine renewable energy developments. Underwater, non-visible devices were shown to have the least impact on people's enjoyment of the marine environment compared to surface based designs. These results suggest that marine energy developments should not affect tourist revenue. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Simulation results show that the combined concept achieves a synergy between the floating wind turbine, the wave energy converter and the tidal turbines. Compared with a single floating wind turbine, the combined concept undertakes reduced surge and pitch motions. The overall power production increases by approximately 22%-45% depending on the environmental conditions. Moreover, the power production of the wind turbine is more stable due to the reduced platform motions and the combined concept is less sensitive to the transient effect induced by an emergency shutdown of the wind turbine.

We found 17 mollusc species: 14 gastropods (10 native and 4 introduced) and 3 bivalves. We found five distribution patterns: native headwater (Arganiella wolfi, Stagnicola palustris, Unio delphinus, Pisidium casertanum and Pisidium personatum) and mouth (Hydrobia acuta, Peringia ulvae and Myosotella myosotis) sensitive-stenochoric species, intermediate sensitive-widely distributed species (Planorbarius metidjensis and Radix balthica), insensitive-eurychoric species (Ancylus fluviatilis), and erratic-distribution pattern species (Galba truncatula and Planorbis cannot us). The highest biodiversity indices have been found in non-impacted headwaters and, to a lesser extent, in tidal streams. The biodiversity of the middle reaches, with varying degrees of impact by acid mine drainage and high water deficit, was scarce and dominated by introduced species. Over 30% of the variation in native and introduced species richness is explained by environmental gradients related to heterogeneity (instream macrophytes cover and Fhi and Qbr indices) and acid runoffs (pH, conductivity, turbidity and concentration of sulphides). Severely impacted sites have no mollusc species. The conservation status of watercourses is also very remarkably influenced by the heterogeneity and contamination of the environment. Conservation values are higher in water bodies located in protected northern and southern sites in both basins. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

This study demonstrates a probabilistic approach for assessment of offshore wind turbines under extreme resonant responses during parked situations. Based on in-situ metocean observations on the North Sea, the environmental contour method is used to establish relevant design conditions.

However, some technologies have considerable potential to impact on the biodiversity of the environments in which they are placed. In this study, an assessment was undertaken of the realistic deployment potential of a range of renewable energy technologies in the UK, considering constraints imposed by biodiversity conservation priorities. We focused on those energy sources that have the potential to make important energy contributions but which might conflict with biodiversity conservation objectives. These included field-scale solar, bioenergy crops, wind energy (both onshore and offshore), wave and tidal stream energy. The spatially-explicit analysis considered the potential opportunity available for each technology, at various levels of ecological risk. The resultant maps highlight the energy resource available, physical and policy constraints to deployment, and ecological sensitivity (based on the distribution of protected areas and sensitive species). If the technologies are restricted to areas which currently appear not to have significant ecological constraints, the total potential energy output from these energy sources was estimated to be in the region of 5,547 TWh/yr. This would be sufficient to meet projected energy demand in the UK, and help to achieve carbon reduction targets. However, we highlight two important caveats. First, further ecological monitoring and surveillance is required to improve understanding of wildlife distributions and therefore potential impacts of utilising these energy sources. This is likely to reduce the total energy available, especially at sea. Second, some of the technologies under investigation are currently not deployed commercially. Consequently this potential energy will only be available if continued effort is put into developing these energy sources/technologies, to enable realisation of their full potential.

The unsteady flow environment is characterized by a high degree of uncertainty. In addition, geometry variations and material imperfections also cause uncertainties in the design process. Probabilistic design methods consider these uncertainties in order to reach acceptable reliability and safety levels for offshore wind turbines. Variations of the rotor blade geometry influence the aerodynamic loads which also affect the reliability of other wind turbine components. Therefore, the present paper is dealing with geometric uncertainties of the rotor blades. These can arise from manufacturing tolerances and operational wear of the blades. First, the effect of geometry variations of wind turbine airfoils on the lift and drag coefficients are investigated using a Latin hypercube sampling. Then, the resulting effects on the performance and the blade loads of an offshore wind turbine are analyzed. The variations of the airfoil geometry lead to a significant scatter of the lift and drag coefficients which also affects the damage-equivalent flapwise bending moments.

The maintenance activities for the array of wind turbines in a wind farm are complex in an offshore environment due to access, weather, and logistic issues. A method has been proposed to address the complexity and intricacies in the planning and formulation of maintenance strategies by using neural network. The approach consists of undertaking the clustering analysis of the array of wind turbines and then to segregate the similar wind turbines based on the analysis results by using Self Organizing Map, (SOM) neural network. Then to predict the expected power output of the wind turbines being part of a certain cluster with the help of another Standard Back Propagation (SBP) neural network. Based on the results, a number of implications have been outlined regarding how the results obtained could provide opportunities in optimizing maintenance strategies. Moreover the weather window issues will be addressed coherently to exploit the information of expected power output in advance by using SBP neural network. So based on the proposed method, the link among the condition of the components, clusters of wind turbines, prediction of power output and the access levels based on the weather conditions could be established which will provide the sound basis for developing optimal and cost effective maintenance strategies.

Sampling was carried out during 25 h cycles to ascertain the flux of megalopae in relation to the main environmental (diel, tidal, tidal amplitude) cycles. The hypothesis that megalopae of some species may be using tidal-stream transport as a mechanism of reinvading the inlet was tested and the relationship between megalopal behaviour and life history strategy was analysed. In general, the flux of megalopae was higher during spring tides, but such differences were only statistically significant for Pisidia longicornis and Liocarcinus sp.2 due to the considerable interdate variation. With the exception of Macropodia sp., megalopae were more abundant close to the bottom. The diel/tidal flux of most abundant species suggested two different patterns of behaviour: megalopae of Liocarcinus spp., Panopeus africanus, Uca tangeri and Brachynotus sextientatus seemed to be re-invading the inlet (specially at nocturnal floods), while megalopae of Ilia nucleus, Nepinnotheres pinnotheres and Macropodia sp. may have been just looking for a suitable place for settlement. The first group corresponded to the species whose zoeal development occurs in open sea, and the second one to species that complete their life cycle within the studied system, suggesting a relationship between the duration of the larval phase and the life cycle strategy of the species.

At least nine rivers are known or believed to sustain spawning populations: the St. Lawrence River (where the spawning stock may be extirpated); the Nepisiguit River in Chaleur Bay; the Tabusintac, Miramichi, Kouchibouguac, and Richibucto rivers in the western Gulf of St. Lawrence; the Saint John and Annapolis rivers in the outer Bay of Fundy; and the Shubenacadie-Stewiacke river system in the inner Bay of Fundy. Historically, commercial striped bass landings in Atlantic Canada were lower than those of the U.S. eastern seaboard, the largest landings being made in New Brunswick. Angling catches are substantial but difficult to verify. Spawning occurs in tidal streams several weeks after ice leaves the system. Adults exhibit regional and long-distance summer migration but seek freshwater refugia for overwintering. Studies of growth, population age structures, comparative total instantaneous mortality rates, meristic and morphometric characters, and parasites, combined with tag returns, strongly suggest that Bay of Fundy rivers, specifically the Annapolis, Shubenacadie, and Saint John, contain stocks that are mixed with U.S. fish in most years. Bay of Fundy fish apparently participate in the striped bass coastal migration on the eastern seaboard, whereas populations in Gulf of St. Lawrence rivers appear to be localized. Anecdotal information from commercial and angling catches suggests more spawning-overwintering populations occur than are known to science.

Traps were deployed at low tide for 24 to 26 h, in the intertidal of the island of Helgoland (North Sea, German Bight), every day during the settlement seasons of 2003 to 2005. The forcing factors were wind direction, predicted residual surface (0 to 8 m) currents, and days since spring tide. The settlement season lasted from the end of June to the end of August; colonisation rates varied among and within years, without a clear pattern. In 2003 and 2004, long periods of low colonisation rates occurred in association with strong and persistent (5 to 10 d) SW winds and eastward currents. In 2003, colonisation peaked at spring tide only when winds were not from SW and currents were not flowing eastwards. In 2005, colonisation rates peaked mainly at, or 1 to 3 d after, spring tide; periods of low colonisation were short, except at the end of the settlement season. According to an existing 2-step model and to local movement of megalopae, colonisation patterns in the intertidal may reflect transport processes: (1) settlement rates on Helgoland are primarily affected by wind-driven currents: SW winds transport larvae out of Helgoland waters, leading to low settlement rates, while other wind regimes transport them towards Helgoland. In the absence of strong SW winds, peaks of settlement at or after spring tide suggest (2) selective tidal stream transport or some form of tidally mediated flow. The absence of SW winds leads to a higher influence of local movement of megalopae, as the number of larvae reaching the benthic habitat is high. In consequence, colonisation of natural substratum may reflect larval transport processes and local movement of larvae in C. maenas and other invertebrates with mobile benthic stages.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,12,0,18,,,0171-8630,,,,,,,,,,,"Fdn Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, D-27498 Helgoland, GermanyFac Ciencias, Secc Oceanol, Montevideo 11400, UruguayBundesamt Seeschifffahrt & Hydrog, D-20359 Hamburg, Germany",Bundesamt Seeschifffahrt & Hydrog,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000247480200014,,

The impact of wind farms, particularly on ground based aviation radars such as those operated for air defence and military and civil air traffic control purposes is likely to become particularly acute as EU member governments strive to meet the requirements for energy generation under the Renewables Obligation. In addition, the increasing number of offshore wind farm projects proposed has the potential to cause interference to marine radars such as coastal vessel traffic services (VTS) and those on-board vessels for navigational purposes.A number of technologies are being pursued to assist in mitigating the impact of wind turbines on both aviation and marine radars. These include additional post-processing of radar returns, the use of gap filler radars to improve coverage, physical obscuration to remove radar-wind farm line of sight, antenna tilting or modification to ensure that wind farms are not illuminated by elevation side lobes, and the lay-out of wind turbines within a farm to reduce coherent summation of returns for radars at fixed locations.

However, this stochastic process in time and space is hard to predict. The purpose is then twofold: first, to provide a stochastic spatial model of the bio-colonisation on a mooring line; second, to show that in some defined environmental conditions, such as low wave height, low wind and current velocities, the monitoring of mooring lines tension can help to assess and reduce uncertainty on this model. Therefore, a comprehensive stochastic modelling based on mussels colonisation was carried out using on-site videotapes, experimental campaigns and expert knowledge. We studied the efficiency of a virtual sensing network using this model and a conditional entropy metric. It is first shown that the spatial model fits well with experimental data, and second that a denser medium accuracy sensor network is to be preferred to a single high accuracy fairlead sensor to reduce the uncertainty on the model parameters.

Here, available measurements of underwater noise from different wind turbines during operation are reviewed to show that source levels are at least 10-20 dB lower than ship noise in the same frequency range. The most important factor explaining the measured sound pressure levels from wind turbines is distance to the turbines with smaller effects of wind speed and turbine size. A simple multi-turbine model demonstrates that cumulative noise levels could be elevated up to a few kilometres from a wind farm under very low ambient noise conditions. In contrast, the noise is well below ambient levels unless it is very close to the individual turbines in locations with high ambient noise from shipping or high wind speeds.

The results reveal that the efficiency and stability of the power generation are significantly affected by the yaw error. Moreover, the yaw error will decrease the effective power and increase the power fluctuation. However, the yaw error has little effects on the motion and the structural load of wind turbines. In addition, the wind-wave misalignment also has little effects on power generation, but it greatly affects the motion and the structural load of wind turbines. The yaw error and the wind-wave misalignment are closely related to the performances of the FOWT.

However, some technologies have considerable potential to impact on the biodiversity of the environments in which they are placed. In this study, an assessment was undertaken of the realistic deployment potential of a range of renewable energy technologies in the UK, considering constraints imposed by biodiversity conservation priorities. We focused on those energy sources that have the potential to make important energy contributions but which might conflict with biodiversity conservation objectives. These included field-scale solar, bioenergy crops, wind energy (both onshore and offshore), wave and tidal stream energy. The spatially-explicit analysis considered the potential opportunity available for each technology, at various levels of ecological risk. The resultant maps highlight the energy resource available, physical and policy constraints to deployment, and ecological sensitivity (based on the distribution of protected areas and sensitive species). If the technologies are restricted to areas which currently appear not to have significant ecological constraints, the total potential energy output from these energy sources was estimated to be in the region of 5,547 TWh/yr. This would be sufficient to meet projected energy demand in the UK, and help to achieve carbon reduction targets. However, we highlight two important caveats. First, further ecological monitoring and surveillance is required to improve understanding of wildlife distributions and therefore potential impacts of utilising these energy sources. This is likely to reduce the total energy available, especially at sea. Second, some of the technologies under investigation are currently not deployed commercially. Consequently this potential energy will only be available if continued effort is put into developing these energy sources/technologies, to enable realisation of their full potential.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,7,0,18,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Royal Soc Protect Birds, RSPB Ctr Conservat Sci, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, EnglandRoyal Soc Protect Birds Scotland, RSPB Ctr Conservat Sci, Edinburgh EH12 9DH, Midlothian, ScotlandRoyal Soc Protect Birds, RSPB Sustainable Dev Policy Team, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, EnglandRoyal Soc Protect Birds, RSPB Conservat Data Management, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, EnglandRSPB Ctr Conservat Sci, David Attenborough Bldg,Pembroke St, Cambridge CB2 3QZ, England",,,,2016-06-22,WOS:000376881700001,27224050,

Tidal and residual currents are reinforced by the south-western dominant wind and drift waters from the English Channel to the North Sea. Previous spatial studies have shown that the advection of larvae could differ from one species to another. Flounder (Pleuronectes flesus) larvae were found offshore, drifting to the north until the fins were formed; then they were found near the coast. However, sole (Solea solea) larvae remained in coastal waters during their development. The difference in larval spatial distribution is assumed to be related to the interaction between vertical migration and advection by alternative tidal currents, leading to a selective tidal stream transport. To describe the vertical distribution of these larvae, two strategies were used. First, a Eulerian study was carried out with samples taken at the same geographical location every 1.5 h for 41 h. Ichthyoplankton were collected in the water mass using a Bongo net and with a suprabenthic multi-net sledge, at four layers above the sea bed, between 0.1 and 1.4 m. Secondly, to enable water movement to be disregarded, a Lagrangian study was carried out by using a Bongo net every 3 h, following a drifting buoy for 3 days. The results show that even during the youngest stages, sole larvae are able to perform tidal and diel vertical migration. We assume that they may limit their advection to the North Sea because of their upward migration during ebb and at night, which may enable them to remain in the same area dealing with the currents. Flounder larvae begin their vertical migration at the stage of notochord flexion, which ends their drift to the north. The larvae reach the bottom of the water column, particularly during ebb when they are concentrated in the first 40 cm above the bottom. This behaviour favours their advection during flow, leading to efficient and fast transport towards the coast.",,,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,45,1,61,,,0142-7873,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Littoral Cote Opale, CNRS, UPRES A 8013, F-62228 Calais, France",,,,2000-10-01,WOS:000089827800001,,

We have simulated the trajectories of migratory ovigerous crabs in the region and determined spatial patterns in migratory success, migratory speeds, the residence times of crabs in different regions of the estuary, and potential larval-release locations. Highly active crabs can start their migration from almost anywhere in the estuary and reach suitable larval-release locations within a typical 4 d migratory period, whereas crabs with lower activity levels can only reach suitable larval-release locations if they start their migration in the lower-to-mid estuary. Migratory speeds in the estuary range from < 1 to > 8 kin d-1. Crabs with lower activity levels are resident in the mid-to-upper estuary for relatively long periods of time, whereas highly active crabs are resident in the lower estuary and coastal ocean for most of the migratory period.

In order to minimize the damage of offshore wind turbines caused by ship impact, a crashworthy device, which contains a rubber blanket and outer steel shell, is proposed. The rubber hardness and the rubber and steel shell thicknesses of the crashworthy device are optimized by comparing the collision-force and nacelle acceleration using LS-DYNA explicit code. The main reason for lessening the maximum collision-force and nacelle acceleration is that the rubber blanket could absorb a portion of ship energy by using its own structure deformation. Therefore, an optimal crashworthy device for the monopile offshore wind turbine, meeting the weight constraint, is suggested and implemented in various impact scenarios. The obvious effects of crashworthy devices are a decrease of the maximum collision-force and nacelle acceleration, especially for ships with smaller initial kinetic energy. The damage area of plastic strain for foundations is reduced to zero when crashworthy devices are used in the analysis scenarios.

The use of numerical models is an essential tool for the prediction of the fatigue life, ultimate loads and controller design. The simultaneous wind and wave loading on a non-stationary foundation with a flexible tower makes the development of numerical models difficult, the validation of these numerical models is a challenging task as the floating offshore wind turbine system is expensive and the testing of these may cause loss of the system. The validation of these numerical models is often made on scaled models of the floating offshore wind turbines, which are tested in scaled environmental conditions. In this study, an experimental validation of two numerical models for a floating offshore wind turbines will be conducted. The scaled model is a 1:35 Froude scaled 5 MW offshore wind turbine mounted on a tension-leg platform. The two numerical models are aero-hydro-servo-elastic models. The numerical models are a theoretical model developed in a MATLAB/Simulink environment by the authors, while the other model is developed in the turbine simulation tool FAST.

Three areas, Kitts Hummock Beach marsh, the St. Jones River marsh, and Bowers marsh near the St. Jones River's mouth, were chosen because these areas are compose of their own geomurphic characteristics and sea-level history. Since significance of the stratigraphic correlations was to determine sedimentary facies and paleoenvironments, multidisciplinary methods such as lithological description, grain-size analysis, organic/inorganic content, water content, mineral composition, botanical analysis, micropaleontological analysis, and 14C datings were performed. Five major divisions of marsh environments were recognized in the stratigraphic sections: freshwater marsh, initial freshwater marsh, slightly brackish marsh, brackish marsh, and salt marsh. Most of the lower part in the stratigraphic sections show freshwater marsh. On the top of this, either brackish marsh or tidal flat/tidal stream was recorded. The pre-Holocene sediments consist of sand, mud, and sandy mud. The pre-Holocene configuration played an important role for developing the Holocene paleoenvironmental changes. The irregular configuration of the pre-Holocene surface within short distances permitted the concurrent development of variable environments such as freshwater marsh, brackish marsh or salt marsh at similar elevations. The freshwater marsh in this case was formed in the areas of isolation, so saline-water cannot encroach upon these areas. This complex development of paleoenvironments leads to a difficulty in stratigraphic correlation and interpretation of local relative sea-level changes. The deposition of subsurface sediments was affected by sediment supply, compaction, fluvial activity, biological competition, local tectonics and isostacy, climate and local relative sea-level changes. It was interpreted that the positions in the changes from freshwater environments to brackish environments or vice versa are the turning points of transgressions and regressions. Therefore, multiple transgressions and regressions were identified in the stratigraphic sections of the study area.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,1225-1283,,,,,,,,,,,"Marine Geol.

In particular, structural health monitoring (SHM) to monitor the foundation (support structure) condition is of utmost importance in offshore-fixed wind turbines. In this work a SHM strategy is presented to monitor online and during service a WT offshore jacket-type foundation. Standard SHM techniques, as guided waves with a known input excitation, cannot be used in a straightforward way in this particular application where unknown external perturbations as wind and waves are always present. To face this challenge, a vibration-response-only SHM strategy is proposed via machine learning methods. In this sense, the fractal dimension is proposed as a suitable feature to identify and classify different types of damage.

These issues have begun to stimulate research and development in the wide control community particularly for these installations that need a high degree of sustainability. Note that this represents a key point for offshore wind turbines, since they are characterised by expensive and/or safety critical maintenance work. In this case, a clear conflict exists between ensuring a high degree of availability and reducing maintenance times, which affect the final energy cost. On the other hand, wind turbines have highly nonlinear dynamics, with a stochastic and uncontrollable driving force as input in the form of wind speed, thus representing an interesting challenge also from the modelling point of view. Suitable control methods can provide a sustainable optimisation of the energy conversion efficiency over wider than normally expected working conditions. Moreover, a proper mathematical description of the wind turbine system should be able to capture the complete behaviour of the process under monitoring, thus providing an important impact on the control design itself. In this way, the control scheme could guarantee prescribed performance, whilst also giving a degree of tolerance to possible deviation of characteristic properties or system parameters from standard conditions, if properly included in the wind turbine model itself.

Daily data on physical variables and on supply and settlement of megalopae were subjected to time series analysis and multiple regression techniques in order to identify periodicity in the variables as well as time lags between larval supply and physical variables. Relaxation of northerly winds, which favor upwelling, was associated with temperature increase and subtidal sea level rise at the coast, which are indicative of coastal convergence of the surface layer. Supply of megalopae to the estuaries, as measured with passive plankton nets, followed a fortnightly cycle with maximum larval supply at the time of maximum tidal amplitude. Supply was enhanced by southerly winds, with delays of 0 to -2 d. Settlement of megalopae on artificial settlement substrates deployed on the bottom was uncoupled to supply at both estuaries. Therefore, transport of C. maenas megalopae to the nearshore is accomplished by onshore advection following downwelling winds, and supply to the estuaries occurs by selective tidal stream transport.

Among the several technological alternatives, wind energy is one of the most emerging prospective because of its renewable, sustainable and environment friendly nature, especially at its offshore locations. The recent growth of the offshore wind energy market has significantly increased the technological importance of the offshore vertical axis wind turbines, both as floating or fixed installations. Particularly, the class of lift driven vertical axis wind turbines is very promising; however, the existing design and technology is not competent enough to meet the global need of offshore wind energy. In this context, the project AEROPITCH co-investigated by EOLFI, CORETI and IRPHE aims at the development of a robust and sophisticated offshore vertical axis wind turbine, which would bring decisive competitive advantage in the offshore wind energy market. In this paper, simulations have been performed on the various airfoils of NACA 4-series, 5-series and Selig profiles at different chord Reynolds numbers of 60000, 100000 and 140000 using double multiple streamtube model with tip loss correction. Based on the power coefficient, the best suitable airfoil S1046 has been selected for a 3-bladed vertical axis wind turbine. Besides the blade profile, the turbine design parameters such as aspect ratio and solidity ratio have also been investigated by varying the diameter and chord of the blade. Further, a series of wind tunnel experiments will be performed on the developed wind turbine, and the implementation of active pitch control in the developed turbine will be investigated in future research.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,978-0-7918-5778-6,,,,,,,,,"Aix Marseille Univ, IRPHE, EOLFI, F-13288 Marseille, FranceAix Marseille Univ, IRPHE, CNRS, F-13288 Marseille, FranceInst Pytheas OSU, CNRS, F-13288 Marseille, FranceAix Marseille Univ, CNRS, MIO, F-13288 Marseille, FranceEOLFI, F-75008 Paris, France",EOLFI,,,2017-12-22,WOS:000417228200046,,

Stratified plankton samples and hydrographic data were collected at 2 h intervals at 3 stations located on a cross-shelf transect. At the Marquesas station, midway between Dry Tortugas and Florida Bay, internal tides were recognized by anomalously cool water, a shallow thermocline with strong density gradients, strong current shear, and a high concentration of pink shrimp larvae at the shallow thermocline. Low Richardson numbers occurred at the pycnocline depth, indicating vertical shear instability and possible turbulent transport from the lower to the upper layer where myses and postlarvae were concentrated. Analysis of vertically stratified plankton suggested that larvae perform vertical migrations and the specific behavior changes ontogenetically; protozoeae were found deeper than myses, and myses deeper than postlarvae. Relative concentrations of protozoea in the upper, middle and bottom layers were consistent with a diel vertical migration, whereas that of postlarvae and myses were consistent with the semidiurnal tides in phase with the flood tide. Postlarvae, the shallowest dwellers that migrate with a semidiurnal periodicity, experienced the largest net onshore flux and larval concentrations were highly correlated with the cross-shelf current. These results provide the first evidence of an onshore tidal transport (a type of selective tidal stream transport, STST), in decapod larvae migrating in continental shelf waters offshore, ca. 100 km from the coast and at a depth of 20 m, while approaching the coastal nursery grounds. Longer time series would be necessary to establish whether internal tides play any role in the larval onshore transport of this species and determine if the STST is the dominant onshore transport mechanism.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,23,1,29,,,0171-8630,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USANOAA Fisheries, SE Fisheries Sci Ctr, Miami, FL 33149 USAUS Geol Survey, Ctr Water & Restorat Studies, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33315 USA",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000250195800015,,

We propose to propagate wind turbine telemetry through a decision tree learning algorithm to detect faults, damage, and abnormal operations. The use of decision trees is motivated by the fact that they tend to be easier to implement and interpret than other quantitative data-driven methods. Furthermore, the telemetry consists of data from condition and structural health monitoring systems, which lends itself nicely in the field of Big Data as large amounts are continuously sampled at high rate from thousands of wind turbines. In this paper, we review several decision tree algorithms, we then train an ensemble Bagged decision tree classifier on a dataset from an offshore wind farm comprising 48 wind turbines, and use it to automatically extract paths linking excessive vibrations faults to their possible root causes.

Training personnel, field maintenance, and frequent boat or helicopter visits to wind turbines (WTs) is becoming a large cost. One reason for this cost is the routine turbine inspection repair and other stochastic maintenance necessitated by increasingly unbalanced figure loads and unequal turbine fatigue distribution in large-scale offshore wind farms (OWFs). In order to solve the problems of unbalanced fatigue loads and unequal turbine fatigue distribution, thereby cutting the maintenance cost, this study analyzes the disadvantages of conventional turbine fatigue definitions. We propose an improved fatigue definition that simultaneously considers the mean wind speed, wind wake turbulence, and electric power generation. Further, based on timed automata theory, a power dispatch approach is proposed to balance the fatigue loads on turbines in a wind farm. A control topology is constructed to describe the logical states of the wind farm main controller (WFMC) in an offshore wind farm. With this novel power control approach, the WFMC can re-dispatch the reference power to the wind turbines according to their cumulative fatigue value and the real wind conditions around the individual turbines in every power dispatch time interval. A workflow is also designed for the control approach implementation. Finally, to validate this proposed approach, wind data from the Horns Rev offshore wind farm in Denmark are used for a numerical simulation. All the simulation results with 3D and 2D figures illustrate that this approach is feasible to balance the loads on an offshore wind farm. Some significant implications are that this novel approach can cut the maintenance cost and also prolong the service life of OWFs.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Tongji Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R ChinaUniv Kaiserslautern, Inst Control Syst, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, GermanyTech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",,,,2020-06-19,WOS:000537688400018,,

If the UK's vast tidal range resources can be harnessed, tidal power has the potential to play a significant role in the decarbonisation of the country's energy mix and help it meet ambitious 2050 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. As a world leader in tidal technology, there are significant economic opportunities for the UK from investment in domestic tidal infrastructure and the potential to export the technology and expertise to other nations.Yet despite its predictability, tidal stream energy bears a higher economic and environmental cost relative to some of its renewable counterparts as the technology must operate in very harsh environments with waves and turbulence producing large unsteady loads on the turbines, resulting in premature device failure and over-conservatism during the design phase.Working with industrial and academic partners alike, the project will centre on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling as well as laboratory scale turbine experiments to understand how unsteady flows, waves and turbulence develop unsteady rotor loading, and how this loading can be incorporated in engineering design tools. In developing a more accurate computational model of rotor dynamics, turbine designs can be optimised, yielding a lower incidence of in-field failures and a potential reduction in the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for consumers.The project falls primarily within the EPSRC Energy research area, however, owing to its multi-disciplinary nature involving fluid mechanics and renewable energy, there is also significant overlap with the Engineering theme. At its heart, the aims of the project are aligned with several key EPSRC strategic objectives, namely, achieving UK energy security and efficiency whilst reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels; ensuring a reliable energy infrastructure which underpins the UK economy; and introducing the next generation of innovative and disruptive technologies, which provide affordable energy and limit the impact on scarce natural resources and the environment.The project takes place in the context of the EPSRC-funded Centre for Doctoral Training in Wind and Marine Energy Systems and Structures (WAMESS CDT), which is a collaboration between the Universities of Strathclyde, Oxford and Edinburgh.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2440746,,,,,,,,University of Oxford,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15388972,,

To protect stream ecosystem integrity, preliminary reference nutrient estimates (TN and TP) as percentiles (25th of all stream reaches and 75th of stream reference reaches) for the six Maryland L3 ecoregions are: Blue Ridge TN 0.29 and 0.64 mg/L, TP 0.0065 and 0.0090 mg/L; Central Appalachians TN 0.40 and 1.0 mg/L, TP 0.0060 and 0.015 mg/L; Middle Atlantic Coastal Plains TN 0.93 and 2.5 mg/L, TP 0.094 and 0.065 mg/L; Northern Piedmont TN 1.6 and 1.8 mg/L, TP 0.010 and 0.015 mg/L; Ridge and Valley TN 0.40 and 0.98 mg/L, TP 0.0063 and 0.012 mg/L; and Southeastern Plains TN 0.33 and 0.82 mg/L, TP 0.016 and 0.042 mg/L. High levels of both TN and TP are present in many streams found in non-tidal watersheds associated with all Maryland ecoregions, but are especially elevated in the Northern Piedmont and Middle Atlantic Coastal Plain ecoregions, with the latter second-order streams (average TN > 2.9 mg/L) significantly higher than all other ecoregion-order combinations. Across all six ecoregions, mean nutrient loading for both TN and TP was generally equivalent in first-order streams to nutrient concentrations seen in both second- and third-order streams, indicating a definite need to increase efforts in preventing nutrients from entering first-order streams. Small-order stream nutrient levels are the drivers for subsequent TN and TP inputs into the upper freshwater tidal reaches of the Chesapeake Bay, resulting in a potential risk for altered estuarine ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,0,7,,,0167-6369,1573-2959,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Appalachian Lab, Frostburg, MD 21532 USA",,,,2013-02-20,WOS:000314033300007,22644126,

Exposure of a fully developed scour hole (at equilibrium state) around a wind turbine mono-pile to the cyclic movement of the structure leads to the backfilling and deformation of the scour hole. The existing approaches to scour prediction for foundation design of offshore wind turbines generally consider wind turbines as static structures and ignore the physical impact of the cyclic movement of the pile on the supporting soil and, hence, on the scour process. Through an experimental program, this paper explains the influence of the cyclic movement of the pile on the local scour in noncohesive sediments. A series of flume tests at two scales were conducted. Simple hydrodynamic conditions and bed sediment configurations were adopted to highlight the effect of pile movement. The results obtained indicate that a mechanism exists by which the scour hole can be significantly deeper and wider in extent than that predicted by conventional methods. This arises through a multistage process consisting of periodically alternating cyclically loaded and unloaded stages simulating a sequence of storms.",,,,,,,,,13,1,0,0,0,0,13,,,0733-950X,1943-5460,,,,,,,,,,"UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Coastal Engn, London WC1E 6BT, EnglandUCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Fluid Mech & Coastal Engn, London WC1E 6BT, England",,,,2019-12-06,WOS:000497660600004,,

The blue crab Callinectes sapidus in the South Atlantic Bight (SAB), USA, inhabits estuaries ranging from large semi-enclosed bays to narrow river mouths where estuarine conditions extend onto the continental shelf. Mature female reproductive status was used as an indicator to identify spawning habitat, and data from long-term fishery independent surveys were used to evaluate spatiotemporal trends in abundance of spawning females. Long-term data (1990-2011) were obtained from the Southeast Area Marine Assessment Program (SEAMAP) South Atlantic survey and the Georgia Ecological Monitoring Trawl Survey. Biological samples were obtained from estuarine and offshore areas of Georgia for a detailed analysis of habitat use. Reproductive status of mature female blue crabs (ovigery, ovary development, egg remnants) was indicative of a summer peak in spawning in Georgia that occurred primarily on the continental shelf as far as 13 km offshore. SEAMAP data provide strong evidence that blue crab females spawn on the continental shelf throughout the SAB, with substantial declines in spawner abundance over time. Empirical orthogonal function analysis of SEAMAP time series was indicative of regional spawning areas defined by biogeography which are poorly aligned with fishery management jurisdictions.

An initial field study found that only females with mature embryos underwent the spawning migration and that postspawned females switched to flood-tide transport for movement back into and up estuaries. Alternatively, a more recent field study found ETT occurred in females throughout embryo development and continued after larval release. An endogenous rhythm in vertical migration underlies ETT during the spawning migration. A past study found the circatidal rhythm was only present in females with mature embryos but not in females with immature embryos or after larval release. The present study reinvestigates this rhythm in vertical migration. Both females with early embryos and postlarval release females entrained in the field have circatidal rhythms, in which they swim vertically at the time of consecutive ebb tides at the collection site or on alternate ebb tides. These results support the field study that ovigerous females undergo ETT throughout embryo development and after larval release.

Based on the existing wave and wave load models, we analytically show that there exist fluctuating components related to the hydrodynamic frequency in the aerodynamic load and aerodynamic torque of offshore wind turbines. Simulation results based on a GH Bladed platform further validates the analysis. Second, in order to reduce the joint impacts of the wave, wind shear and tower shadow on the wind turbine, a variable pitch control method is proposed. The integrated tower top vibration acceleration signal is superimposed on the collective pitch reference signal, then the triple frequency (3P) fluctuating component of the wind turbine output power and the azimuth angle of each blade are converted into the pitch angle adjustment signal of each blade, which is superimposed on the collective pitch signal for individual pitch control.

Internal damages (such as fatigue, wear and cracks) are generally caused by system degradation, whereas the external damages (such as icing, wind and wave shocks) result from harsh marine environments. In this paper, we investigate an optimal opportunistic condition-based maintenance (OCBM) policy for a multi-bladed offshore wind turbine system subjected to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and environmental shocks. When the length of a crack in a blade reaches critical size D, the blade breaks and it has to be replaced by a new one. An environmental shock is minor with probability 1 - p and catastrophic with probability p (0 <= p <= 1). A minor shock causes an instant drop in power output without resulting in any system failure, whereas a catastrophic shock stops the wind turbine and requires system replacement. When the length of a crack in one of the blades exceeds a threshold d (< D), it undergoes a major repair and a preventive maintenance (PM) action is performed on the other blade(s); otherwise, a planned PM task is conducted for the whole system when its operational age attains a value of T (> 0). The problem is to simultaneously determine the optimal control parameters d* and T* such that the average long-run maintenance cost per blade per unit time is minimized. The explicit expression of the objective function is derived and under certain conditions, the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solution are shown for the infinite-horizon case. The proposed maintenance model is tested on a three-bladed wind turbine and its performance over the system life cycle is evaluated using a Monte-Carlo simulation technique. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the on-land wind farms are limited by space, noise, and visual pollution and, therefore, many countries build wind farms near the shore. Until now, most offshore wind farms have been built in relatively shallow water (less than 30 m) with fixed tower type wind turbines. Recently, several countries have planned to move wind farms to deep water offshore locations to find stronger and steadier wind fields as compared to near shore locations. For the wind farms in deeper water, floating platforms have been proposed to support the wind turbine. The model tests described in this paper were performed at MARIN (maritime research institute netherlands) with a model setup corresponding to a 1:50 Froude scaling. The wind turbine was a scaled model of the national renewable energy lab (NREL) 5 MW horizontal axis reference wind turbine supported by three different generic floating platforms: a spar, a semisubmersible, and a tension-leg platform (TLP). The wave environment used in the tests is representative of the offshore in the state of Maine. In order to capture coupling between the floating platform and the wind turbine, the 1st bending mode of the turbine tower was also modeled. The main purpose of the model tests was to generate data on coupled motions and loads between the three floating platforms and the same wind turbine for the operational, design, and survival seas states. The data are to be used for the calibration and improvement of the existing design analysis and performance numerical codes. An additional objective of the model tests was to establish the advantages and disadvantages among the three floating platform concepts on the basis of the test data. The paper gives details of the scaled model wind turbine and floating platforms, the setup configurations, and the instrumentation to measure motions, accelerations, and loads along with the wind turbine rpm, torque, and thrust for the three floating wind turbines.

These scour processes are often especially severe at sites where mobile sediments, such as sands, are present in the superficial seabed soils. Loss of local soil support to the monopile, caused by scour erosion, can lead to significant changes in the dynamic characteristics of the wind turbine support structure. This can result in accelerated fatigue damage, owing to the applied cyclic loads from the wind turbine generator, especially at the rotor frequency. Although scour erosion can be controlled by appropriate scour protection systems, there is a lack of knowledge to support the design and optimization of these protection measures, to ensure that the dynamic performance of the wind turbine support structure remains within acceptable limits. This paper describes an experimental campaign conducted on a 1:20 scale model of a driven monopile foundation and wind turbine support structure, founded in a prepared sand test bed in the Fast Flow Facility flume (HR Wallingford, UK).

The reliability perspective here refers to the lifecycle integrity management of the system to ensure reliability by actions during design, fabrication, installation, operation, and decommissioning. The assessment should be based on response analysis that properly accounts for the effect of different sub-systems (rotor, drivetrain, tower, support structure, and mooring) on the system behavior. Moreover, the load effects should be determined so as to be proper input to the integrity check of these sub-systems. The response analysis should serve as the basis for design and managing inspections and monitoring, with due account of inherent uncertainties.

Stomach content analyses further demonstrated the dietary preference for prey species that lived on the turbines (i.e. Jassa herdmani and Pisidia longicornis).

In 1994, exotic striped bass (Morone saxatilis), native longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), and exotic yellowfin goby (Acanthogobus flavimanus) migrated tidally, occurring near the surface on flood tides and near the bottom on ebb tides. This strategy may have facilitated retention, because landward residual currents were absent in this drought year. During 1995, this behavior persisted for striped bass and yellowfin goby, even though landward residual currents were present under high river-flow conditions. In moderate river-flow conditions (1996), longfin smelt again migrated tidally, whereas at another station adjacent to shallow bays, longfin smelt, striped bass, and native delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) migrated on a reverse diel cycle, occurring near the surface by day and at depth by night. Reverse diel migration may facilitate horizontal transport and retention. Therefore, young fishes appeared to be behaviorally flexible in different environmental conditions to maximize retention. Vertical migrations may also enhance feeding success because zooplankton prey similarly migrated in the LSZ.

Results are discussed in relation to the flood tidal transport theory. Following synchronisation to current reversal, glass eels subjected to constant conditions displayed a weak rhythmic activity suggesting that locomotor behaviour might, in the wild, synchronise to several environmental cues related to the tide.

The data required for such extrapolation are obtained by stochastic time-domain simulation of the inflow turbulence, the incident waves, and the turbine response. Prediction of accurate loads depends on assumptions made in the simulation models employed. While for the wind, inflow turbulence models are relatively well established; for wave input, the current practice is to model irregular (random) waves using a linear wave theory. Such a wave model does not adequately represent waves in shallow waters where most offshore wind turbines are being sited. As an alternative to this less realistic wave model, the present study investigates the use of irregular nonlinear (second-order) waves for estimating loads on an offshore wind turbine with a focus on the fore-aft tower bending moment at the mudline. We use a 5 MW utility-scale wind turbine model for the simulations. Using, first, simpler linear irregular wave modeling assumptions, we establish long-term loads and identify governing environmental conditions (i.e., the wind speed and wave height) that are associated with the 20-year return period load derived using the inverse first-order reliability method. We present the nonlinear irregular wave model next and incorporate it into an integrated wind-wave response simulation analysis program for offshore wind turbines. We compute turbine loads for the governing environmental conditions identified with the linear model and also for an extreme environmental state. We show that computed loads are generally larger with the nonlinear wave modeling assumptions; this establishes the importance of using such refined nonlinear wave models in stochastic simulation of the response of offshore wind turbines.",,,,,27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering,"JUN 15-20, 2008JUN 15-20, 2008","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Estoril, PORTUGALEstoril, PORTUGAL",18,1,1,0,0,0,19,,,0892-7219,1528-896X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,,2009-11-01,WOS:000270458200012,,

In this study, a deep learning neural network was constructed to predict wind power based on a very high-frequency SCADA database with a sampling rate of 1-s. Input features were engineered based on the physical process of offshore wind turbines, while their linear and non-linear correlations were further investigated through Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients and the deep learning algorithm, respectively. Initially, eleven features were used in the predictive model, which are four wind speeds at different heights, three measured pitch angles of each blade, average blade pitch angle, nacelle orientation, yaw error, and ambient temperature. A comparison between different features shown that nacelle orientation, yaw error, and ambient temperature can be reduced in the deep learning model. The simulation results showed that the proposed approach can reduce the computational cost and time in wind power forecasting while retaining high accuracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Using coalescent simulations, the oldest population subdivision events were estimated to date back to the time the study area was flooded following the Last Glacial Maximum.

The commonly used method that account for the variability of the response and the environmental conditions is the full long-term analysis (FLTA), which is accurate but time consuming. It is a direct integration of all the probability distribution of short-term extremes and the environmental conditions. Since the long-term extreme responses are usually governed by very few important environmental conditions, the long-term analysis can be greatly simplified if such conditions are identified. For offshore structures, one simplified method is the environmental contour method (ECM), which uses the short-term extreme probability distribution of important environmental conditions selected on the contour surface with the relevant return periods. However, because of the inherent difference of offshore wind turbines and ordinary offshore structures, especially their non monotonic behavior of the responses under wind loads, ECM cannot be directly applied because the environmental condition it selects is not close to the actual most important one.The paper presents a modified environmental contour method (MECM) for bottom-fixed offshore wind turbine applications. It can identify the most important environmental condition that governs the long-term extreme. The method is tested on the NREL 5 MW wind turbine supported by a simplified jacket-type support structure.

North-bound humpbacks pass mainly along the eastern coastlines of New Zealand,, plus 1 group passing through Cook Strait to the western side of the North Island and another passing the western side of Stewart Island and round the south-west corner of the South Island before leaving the coast. South-bound humpbacks pass mainly along the western coast of New Zealand, forming a large aggregation near the south-west corner of the South Island, while others follow the east coast of the North Island as far as East Cape, but few occur elsewhere along the eastern coastlines or pass through Cook Strait. Seasonal variation in commencing dates, duration of migration, time of peak and the periods taken by equivalent proportions of the humpback groups are described for 36 seasons in Cook Strait, 3 at Whangamumu and 4 at Centre Island. The rate of migration, times of arrival, peak concentration and latitudinal spread of the migrating stock, at phases of the passage from Antarctic to tropical waters and return, are cal-culated and discussed. Of a number of environmental factors discussed as possible modifiers of the route followed by humpbacks in New Zealand coastal waters, the most important appears to be the orientation of coastline in relation to the migration route, which shows some evidence of trends towards the north-west and south-east during the north-ward and southward migration past New Zealand. While small and localized effects are produced by turbidity, tidal streams, and the presence of whalefeed, no consistent modification of the migration route in relation to bottom topography, direction of ocean currents os the hydrological conditions of differing water masses could be demonstrated. The routes followed by migrating humpbacks in all oceanic waters are consistent with the hypothesis that the main requirement of this sp. is to reach some area of coastal waters in sub-tropical or tropical regions for normal breeding behavior, whether near continental shores or small islands. Because of the geographical position of continental land masses and islands in relation to all the oceanic areas, the fulfilling of the above requirement should result in migration routes and segregated populations distributed in almost exactly the oceanic areas in which humpbacks are known to occur. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. abst",,,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,27,2,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Victoria U.

Different patterns of interconnectivity between subpopulations will give rise to different responses to exploitation and management, but they will also have different capacities to generate the genetic and phenotypic differences often used to discriminate between stocks. Consequently, knowledge of ontogenetic and seasonal patterns in the distribution, movement and behaviour of individuals is crucial to identifying population substructure. This paper considers the evidence gathered about movements and behaviour of adult fishes from mark-recapture and electronic tagging studies for a number of fish species in the North Sea and elsewhere in U.K. waters in an attempt to understand population structure and the processes that may give rise to it.

Thus, a number of condition assessments and engineering designs are being studied, such as the site selection, the wind turbines layout, the environmental impact assessment, the maritime engineering, the installation and maintenance fleets. In this paper, we carried out the winds and waves as the critical conditions of sea status for the installation of offshore wind turbines. The winds and waves data were collected by a data buoy which was deployed near the entrance of Taichung Harbor. The wind speeds were measured at 15 m above the sea surface. In the case study, we assumed a jack-up vessel will be used for installation of wind turbines. Then, some benchmarking conditions are filled into the assessment. For example, the conditions for operated criteria were suggested as wind speeds below 15 m/s and significant wave heights below 1.5 m in a water depth of 30 m. Moreover, a continuous working duration is considered as 15 hours for installation of a wind turbine from a tower, a nacelle, and blades. Eventually, the yearly available days for the wind turbine installation were assessed about 175 days. Different working modes, such as piling, cable laying, and maintenance, were discussed those yearly available days as well.

In this study, we performed numerical experiments to explore some of the effects of atmospheric stability and surface roughness on wind turbine dynamics. We used large-eddy simulation to create atmospheric winds and compute the wind turbine flows, and we modeled the wind turbines as revolving and flexible actuator lines coupled to a wind turbine structural and system dynamic model. We examined the structural moments about the wind turbine blade, low-speed shaft, and nacelle; power production; and wake evolution when large 5-MW turbines are subjected to winds generated from low-and high-surface roughness levels representative of offshore and onshore conditions, respectively, and also neutral and unstable atmospheric conditions. In addition, we placed a second turbine 7 rotor diameters downwind of the first one so that we could explore wake effects under these different conditions. The results show that the turbulent structures generated within the atmospheric boundary layer wind simulations cause isolated loading events at least as significant as when a turbine is waked by an upwind turbine. The root-mean-square (RMS) turbine loads are consistently larger when the surface roughness is higher. The RMS blade-root out-of-plane bending moment and low-speed shaft torque are higher when the atmospheric boundary layer is unstable as compared with when it is neutral. However, the RMS yaw moments are either equal or reduced in the unstable case as compared with the neutral case. For a given surface roughness, the ratio of power produced by the downwind turbine relative to that of the upwind turbine is 15-20% higher when the conditions are unstable as compared with neutral. For a given atmospheric stability, this power ratio is 10% higher with the onshore roughness value versus the offshore one. The main conclusion is that various coherent turbulent structures that form under different levels of atmospheric stability and surface roughness have important effects on wind turbine structural response, power production, and wake evolution.",,,,,,,,,356,18,0,0,1,0,409,,,1468-5248,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA",,,,2012-07-12,WOS:000305417200001,,

The turbines and the platforms were subjected to atmospheric boundary layer flows. Various sensitivity studies on fatigue loads with respect to the positions of the downstream turbine were performed and validated with a large-eddy simulation tool. In particular, the effect of various lateral positions of the downstream turbine relative to the upstream turbine were considered using time-series turbine wake data generated from the large-eddy simulation tool which served as an input to an aero-elastic wind turbine model to assess the loads. The load response from the rotor, tower, and the floating platform for the downstream turbine were sensitive to the lateral offset positions where turbines that were partially exposed to upstream turbine wakes yielded significant increases in the cyclic load range. For the given set of lateral positions for the downstream turbine, the largest damage equivalent load occurred when the turbine was one rotor diameter to the left of the centerline, when looking upstream, which is the position of the turbine fully exposed to upstream turbine wake. On the other hand, the fatigue load on the downstream turbine placed on the right side of the position fully exposed to the upstream turbine wake, yielded lower stress due to the non-symmetric shape of the turbine wake. The configuration associated with the largest damage equivalent loads was further investigated in a large-eddy simulation, modeling both the upstream and downstream turbines. It was found that the energy spectra at the blade rotational frequency were a magnitude order higher for the downstream turbine, especially for surge, heave, pitch, and yaw motion of the platform.

During the last few years, there has been an increase in offshore wind turbine (OWT) projects especially in China. Considering the fact that ocean environment where these offshore wind turbines operate usually has a negative impact on their structural health, the demand for investigating the dynamic characteristics of offshore wind turbines based on sea test is increasing. However, current studies are mainly focused on method development, theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, and few attention has been given to the study of the dynamic characteristics of an actual OWT in different operational states based on sea test. To improve the current studies, in September 2016, November 2016 and April 2017 a series of monitoring campaigns of an actual in service OWT and its monopile were conducted at an offshore wind farm in the sea area near Jiangsu Province, China. For the purpose of acquiring high-quality vibration signal, one type of artificial excitation was adopted to excite the OWT vibration. In these monitoring campaigns, with the help of a group of wireless health monitoring sensor nodes developed by Ocean University of China (OUC), we successfully acquired the vibration signal of the wind turbine in parked state and normal operational state and acquired the vibration signal of the monopile in construction, which means no tower was installed. Afterwards, two modal analysis methods, the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) and stochastic subspace identification (SSI), were used to obtain the modal parameters of the tested structure using the vibration signal under artificial excitation and random wave excitation, respectively. The results show that the ERA method can successfully identify the first two order modal parameters of the monopile and the first three order modal parameters of the wind turbine in parked or operational state. However, the SSI method failed to identify the third-order modal parameters of the wind turbine, regardless of whether it is in parked state or operational state (only the first two order modal parameters can be identified); meanwhile, SSI failed to identify the modal parameters of the monopile. Concerning the high-level environmental noise in an offshore site, we applied weak-mode identification (WMI) for the first time to obtain the modal parameters of OWT using vibration signal under both artificial excitation and random wave excitation. The results indicated that WMI has achieved the same good performance as the ERA when the vibration signal under artificial excitation is used. When the vibration signal under random wave is used, WMI successfully identified the first order modal parameters of the monopile and the first three order modal parameters of the wind turbine in parked or operational state, which indicated a better ability than that of the SSI method. We can conclude that the modal parameters of the wind turbine can be obtained by the WMI method and ERA method, and the ERA method is the best way to obtain the modal parameters of monopile under artificial excitation. These monitoring campaign of an actual OWT not only provide modal information support for structural maintenance and operation safety assessment, but also provide a real data reference for wind turbine design.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,1,0,16,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China, Coll Engn, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaHarbin Engn Univ, Sci & Technol Underwater Vehicle Lab, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R ChinaQingdao Univ Technol, Cooperat Innovat Ctr Engn Construct & Safety Shan, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaPowerChina Huadong Engn Corp Ltd, Hangzhou 311122, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,,,2019-10-22,WOS:000489191300018,,

To reduce maintenance frequency, we proposed an optimized power distribution for balancing fatigue differences between wind turbines, and adopted the consistency algorithm in the multi-agent system (MAS), using the fatigue value of the wind turbine as the consistency variable to solve the problems with different fatigue values.",,,,,International Ural Conference on Electrical Power Engineering (UralCon)International Ural Conference on Electrical Power Engineering (UralCon),"SEP 22-24, 2020SEP 22-24, 2020",,"S Ural State Univ, Chelyabinsk, RUSSIAS Ural State Univ, Chelyabinsk, RUSSIA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-7281-6209-6,,,,,,,,,"South Ural State Univ, Elect Stn, Grids & Syst Power Supply, Chelyabinsk, Russia",,,,2021-04-20,WOS:000628984900044,,

We studied the spawning biology of female crabs hand-captured in the Carrot Island Embayment, central North Carolina. Crabs were retained sub-tidally in submerged, partially buried minnow traps and fed daily. Of 124 experimental animals, 66% had two or more clutches of eggs with three individuals producing seven clutches over 18 wks. The longer the crabs were held, the more clutches they produced. We infer that an average size crab (127 mm carapace width) would produce eight clutches over a 25-wk spawning period. Since larger crabs had larger clutches but produced them less frequently than smaller crabs, reproductive output over IS wks of the spawning season was statistically similar for most size groups. Lipofuscin index values were higher for crabs that had recently molted to maturity than for crabs that had been spawning for 18 wks. Sponge damage of 2307 crabs, determined by the degree of deviation from the rounded form of an intact sponge, indicated that animals caught by crab-pots had significantly more sponge damage than hand-captured crabs. Sponge damage was most extensive during mid-summer and the extent of damage differed among the smallest and largest size groups during this time. Our finding that reproductive output is similar for most size groups brings into question management plans that suggest the release of the largest mature females.",,,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,36,1,53,,,0007-4977,1553-6955,,,,,,,,,,"Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Dept Biol, Univ Program Ecol, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA",Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci,,,2006-09-01,WOS:000241443500003,,

The present paper gives a novel contribution to this field. First of all, we give a thorough review of the studies that have analysed the relation between experience with wind turbines and attitude. In addition, we supplement the review by analysing the effect of travel distance to the nearest offshore wind farm and the wind farms attributes on attitude towards offshore wind farms. The results point towards that the travel time and the attributes of the nearest offshore wind farm influence the attitude significantly. Travel time has mixed effects on the attitude, whilst offshore wind farms with many turbines generate more positive attitudes compared to wind farms with fewer turbines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The article focuses on innovative ocean energy (tidal stream, wave and salinity gradient energy). It can be said that there is a possible lack of integration between the Renewable Energy Directive and the EU rules on the protection of habitats, species and water: the Habitats Directive, the Birds Directive, the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The role that MSP could play in solving this is assessed with regard to the following two legal issues that reflect the said lack of integration: 1) while there are derogation clauses, there is no obligation for Member States to apply these clauses and to undertake a balancing act between ocean energy, on the one hand, and the protection of habitats, species and water, on the other; 2) even if these clauses are applied, it remains unclear how much weight Member States should attach to ocean energy under a subsequent balancing act. The concept of Maritime Spatial Planning in theory is very suitable for guaranteeing that the interests of both renewable energy policy and environmental policy are duly taken into account in licensing procedures and management measures. The contribution that MSP can make towards increased integration is, however, strongly dependent on the way MSP is interpreted on the Member State level. This is illustrated by a discussion of the differences in the current MSP approaches in Scotland and the Netherlands. This article concludes that Maritime Spatial Planning may-if certain conditions are fulfilled- be a suitable way to create a necessity to balance the EU's habitats, species and water protection rules with (ocean) renewable energy projects, on different levels of governance. Nevertheless, it also concludes that MSP alone cannot guarantee a balancing act that represents the goals of the Renewable Energy Directive and those of the aforementioned environmental directives in an equal manner.

The renewable energy market is continuously pushing the wind turbine sizes and performances. This is the reason why nowadays offshore wind turbines concepts are going toward a 10 MW reference wind turbine model. The aim of the work is to perform operational analyses on the 10-MW reference wind turbine finite element model using an aeroelastic code in order to obtain long-time-low-cost simulations. The aeroelastic code allows simulating the damages in several ways: by reducing the edgewise/flapwise blades stiffness, by adding lumped masses or considering a progressive mass addiction (i.e. ice on the blades). The damage detection is then performed by means of Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) techniques. Virtual accelerometers are placed in order to simulate real measurements and to estimate the modal parameters. The feasibility of a robust damage detection on the model has been performed on the HAWT model in parked conditions. The situation is much more complicated in case of operating wind turbines because the time periodicity of the structure need to be taken into account. Several algorithms have been implemented and tested in the simulation environment. They are needed in order to carry on a damage detection simulation campaign and develop a feasible real-time damage detection method.

In the field, the migration may be environmentally affected by water temperature and the migratory behavior could be physiologically dependent on the body condition (energetic status). To investigate how these environmental and physiological effects on the migration are behaviorally mediated, we experimentally tested the effects of changes in water temperature and body condition on locomotor activity (upstream swimming) and salinity preference of Anguilla anguilla glass eels. Low water temperature reduced significantly both locomotor activity and preference for freshwater, in accordance with field data showing that low water temperatures hinder both the estuarine migration and river recruitment. Glass eels switched from a freshwater- towards a saltwater-preference as their body condition decreased, confirming that the energetic status may affect the migratory behavior. We suggest that, in the wild, this condition-dependent change in salinity preference of low body condition glass eels induces an early settlement in marine or estuarine habitats. Such a behavioral shift, stopping the energy expenditure linked to river-oriented migratory behavior, may be adaptive by limiting the probability of death due to exhaustion. Our results show that the glass eel migratory behavior, through locomotor activity and salinity preference, may be controlled by interacting physiological and environmental factors.

Heronemus at the University of Massachusetts. Since then, very little progress has been made in the deployment of these systems despite the significant advantages afforded by floating wind turbines, namely access to superior wind resources and increased placement flexibility. Aside from the large capital costs associated with construction, one of the most significant challenges facing offshore floating wind turbines is a limited simulation and load estimation capability. Many wind turbine aerodynamic analysis methods rely on assumptions that may not be applicable to the highly dynamic environment in which floating wind turbines are expected to operate. This study characterizes the unique operating conditions that make aerodynamic analysis of offshore floating wind turbines a challenge. Conditions that may result in unsteady flow are identified, and a method to identify aerodynamically relevant platform modes is presented. Operating conditions that may result in a breakdown of the momentum balance equations are also identified for different platform configurations. It is shown that offshore floating wind turbines are subjected to significant aerodynamic unsteadiness fixed-bottom offshore turbines. Aerodynamic analysis of offshore floating wind turbines may require the use of higher-fidelity engineering-level' models than commonly in use today.

The Kaimal spectral model was developed in a flat and homogeneous onshore site and its applicability in offshore environment, e.g. the North Sea, where a number of wind turbines are in operation, is not thoroughly documented. The present paper utilizes the wind data recorded on the offshore platform FINO 1 in 2007 and 2008 to study the single-point auto-spectral and cross-spectral densities of wind turbulence. It investigates the validity of the Kaimal model, the Mann spectral model, the IEC Kaimal model and the one proposed in the NORSOK standard N-003. The latter standard is developed by the Norwegian petroleum industry for the design of offshore structures. Time series of 1 h duration are considered and a simple non-stationary wind model based on a time-varying fluctuating mean is used to increase the number of samples that can be treated as stationary.For wind velocities ranging from 14 m s(-1) to 28 m s(-1), a good agreement is observed between the Kaimal spectra and the measured ones, although the power spectral density of the wind fluctuations is larger than predicted for reduced frequencies below 0.04. The Mann spectral model showed a good agreement with the measured spectra. At the altitude of 80 m, we found in average Gamma = 3.7, alpha epsilon(2/3) = 0.04 m(4/3)s(-2) and L = 70 m.

However, the on-land wind farms are limited by space, noise, and visual pollution, and therefore many countries build wind farms near shore. Up to now, most of offshore wind farms have been built in relatively shallow water (less than 30m) with fixed tower type wind turbines. Recently, several countries plan to move wind farms to deep water offshore locations to find stronger and steadier wind fields as compared to near shore locations. For the wind farms in deeper water, floating platforms have been proposed to support the wind turbine.The model tests described in this paper were performed at MARIN (Maritime Research Institute Netherlands) with a model set-up corresponding to a 1:50 Froude scaling. The wind turbine was a scaled model of the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) 5MW, horizontal axis reference wind turbine supported by three different generic floating platforms: a spar, a semi-submersible and a tension-leg platform (TLP). The wave environment used in the tests is representative of the offshore in the state of Maine. In order to capture coupling between the floating platform and the wind turbine, the 1st bending mode of the turbine tower was also modeled.The main purpose of the model tests was to generate data on coupled motions and loads between the three floating platforms and the same wind turbine for the operational, design, and survival seas states. The data are to be used for calibration and improvement of existing design analysis and performance numerical codes. An additional objective of the model tests was to establish advantages and disadvantages among the three floating platform concepts on the basis of test data.The paper gives details of the scaled model wind turbine and floating platforms, the set-up configurations, and the instrumentation to measure motions, accelerations and loads as well as wind turbine rpm, torque and thrust for the three floating wind turbines.

One of the most important challenges is scouring around the piles of these turbines due to sea waves and current interaction. Many studies have been conducted in this respect; however, the results are insufficient, and the phenomenon remains poorly understood in tripod wind turbines. In this work, an attempt is made by combining the waves and currents, and changing the substructure of the turbine and the type of the bed materials, to extend the investigation of this phenomenon. The current research is focused on presenting the trend of changes in the amount of scouring.

For offshore wind farms, which are placed in harsh and remote environments, damage detection is critically important to schedule maintenance tasks and reduce operation and maintenance costs. One critical component to be monitored on a wind turbine is the pitch bearing, which can operate at low speed and high loads. Classical methods and features for general purpose bearings cannot be applied effectively to wind turbine pitch bearings owing to their specific operating conditions (high loads and non-constant very low speed with changing direction). Thus, damage detection of wind turbine pitch bearings is currently a challenge. In this study, entropy indicators are proposed as an alternative to classical bearing analysis. For this purpose, spectral and permutation entropy are combined to analyze a raw vibration signal from a low-speed bearing in several scenarios. The results indicate that entropy values change according to different types of damage on bearings, and the sensitivity of the entropy types differs among them.

In describing the vertical distribution of the mean wind speed and shear stress within wind farms, our model estimates the mean kinetic energy harvested from the atmospheric boundary layer, and determines the partitioning between the wind power captured by the wind turbines and that absorbed by the underlying land or water. A length scale based on the turbine geometry, spacing, and performance characteristics, is able to estimate the asymptotic limit for the fully-developed flow through wind-turbine arrays, and thereby determine if the wind-farm flow is fully developed for very large turbine arrays. Our model is validated using data collected in controlled wind-tunnel experiments, and its usefulness for the prediction of wind-farm performance and optimization of turbine-array spacing are described.

If so, what does this tell us about the nature of wind power development patterns? This study makes use of industry data from 44 wind farms, including 11 offshore wind farms, 19 onshore wind farms located in farmland and 14 wind farms located in forested areas with a total capacity of 1190 MW installed actual wind farms to test four hypotheses based on preconceptions identified in a literature review. Testing the validity of these preconceptions is important because if policymakers are to design policy to facilitate specific development patterns in a given nation, they need to be clear on what is working in the market. Our data suggest that, contrary to popular belief, offshore wind farms do not produce more energy per installed MW when compared to onshore wind farms. However, our data confirm that offshore wind farms produce more energy than onshore wind farms. We contend that this has less to do with superior wind quality in offshore sites than with scale differences. It appears that developers construct far larger offshore wind farms in order to presumably counteract the proportionally higher development costs associated with marine environments. One other remarkable finding associated with this study is that onshore wind turbines that are located in forested areas might be capable of matching the power production of offshore wind farms without incurring the additional costs associated with offshore projects.

One potential risk involves marine mammals and other species colliding with rotating tidal turbine blades. Concern about potential collision-driven mortality or injury of these charismatic protected species has led to regulators (including project partners Marine Scotland [MS], Scottish Natural Heritage [SNH] and Natural Resources Wales [NRW]) adopting a precautionary approach when considering consent applications, resulting in a slowdown in MRE site development. If animals are to avoid collision they will need sufficient warning of turbines' presence to take timely action. With water flow and swimming speeds significantly restricting visual detection ranges, long-range detection (i.e. warning) will be through acoustic means. However there is uncertainty over whether animals can hear turbines over naturally occurring ambient noise in these energetic sites (from water flow, bed load transport and turbulence). As a result, developers and regulators (incl. MS) are considering whether to add extra noise sources to their turbines to ensure animals can perceive and avoid them. Other industries such as aquaculture, fishing and construction use Acoustic Deterrent Devices (ADDs) to scare seals and other animals away from potentially dangerous areas by producing loud, aversive sounds. For this reason ADDs are currently being considered as a mitigation method to reduce potential collision risk among tidal turbines. However, concerns exist regarding potential undue long-term exclusion of animals from large areas, especially as tidal-stream MRE turbines are intended to operate for decades rather than short periods. Furthermore it is not clear over what range ADDs will be audible given the already noisy environments targeted for turbine placement, and how this might vary over the tidal cycle. There is therefore an urgent need to assess the detectability (or not) of ADDs in these environments.The overall project objective is to clarify how the detectability of commercially available ADDs in real tidal-stream environments varies across collision-relevant spatial scales (at least tens to hundreds of metres, but potentially further dependent on ambient noise levels) and across the ebb-flood and spring-neap tidal cycles. A detailed analysis of existing acoustic datasets from tidal-stream environments will allow us to understand how ambient noise levels vary across tidal cycles across frequencies relevant to marine mammal hearing. This will allow development of improved range-dependent sound propagation models describing ADD signal transmission in tidal-stream environments. The transmission of different ADD signals will then be experimentally tested under varying flow conditions to assess ranges of acoustic detectability, validate propagation models and consider likely impacts on marine mammals. This will improve our understanding of whether or not ADDs could provide a suitable mitigation technique to reduce potential collision rates of marine mammals with tidal turbines. The impact of the expected outcomes of this proposal will be to allow the regulatory project partners (Marine Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and Natural Resources Wales) to develop long-term evidence-based policies concerning the use of ADDs as a practical and proportionate means to mitigate marine mammal collision risk potentially posed by tidal turbines. Such policies will contribute towards long-term environmental sustainability of the MRE sector and improve Scotland's and Wales' ability to fulfil their (inter-)national obligations in terms of conservation of marine mammals and other mobile marine species.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/R014132/1,,,,,,,,Scottish Association For Marine Science,Scottish Association For Marine Science,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15316927,,

The result of the study demonstrates a large effect on bat habitat use at wind turbines sites compared to control sites. Bat activity was 20 times higher at control sites compared to wind turbine sites, which suggests that habitat loss is an important impact to consider in wind farm planning We strongly recommend that the loss of the foraging habitat loss is considered in mitigation hierarchy (avoiding, reducing, offsetting) when compensating for negative impacts of wind farms.",,,,,,,,,26,1,0,0,17,0,29,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,,,,,,,"IAC Inst Agron Neo Caledonien, Equipe ARBOREAL Agr Biodiversite & Valorisat, BP 73, Port Laguerre 98890, Paita, New CaledoniaMuseum Natl Hist Nat, Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat, UMR MNHN CNRS 7204, Paris, FranceStn Biol Marine, Pl Croix, F-29900 Concarneau, France",IAC Inst Agron Neo CaledonienStn Biol Marine,,,2018-03-01,WOS:000424938300007,,

In this study, several wind turbines are designed for low wind speed areas around the world mainly for domestic energy consumption. The wind speed range of 4-12 mph is considered, which is selected based on the average wind speeds in the Atlanta, GA and surrounding areas. These areas have relatively low average wind speeds compared to various other parts of the United States. Wind energy has been identified as an important source of renewable energy. Traditionally wind energy utilization is limited to areas with higher wind speeds. In reality a lot of areas in the world including Atlanta, GA., have low average wind speeds and demand high energy consumption. In most cases, wind turbines are installed in remote offshore or away from habitat locations, causing heavy investment in installation and maintenance, and loss of energy transfer over long distances. Therefore, the main focus of this study is to extract wind energy domestically at low wind speeds. A few more advantages of small scale wind turbines include reduced visibility, less noise and reduced detrimental environmental effects such as killing of birds, when compared to traditional large turbines. With the latest development in wind turbine technology it is now possible to employ small scale wind turbines that have much smaller foot print and can generate enough energy for small businesses or residential applications. The low speed wind turbines are typically located near residential areas, and are much smaller in sizes compared to the large out of habitat wind turbines. In this study, several designs of wind turbines are modeled using SolidWorks. Virtual aerodynamic analysis is performed using SolidWorks Flow simulation software, and then optimization of the designs is performed based on maximizing the starting rotational torque and acceleration.

Driven by the demand of customers and the pressure to keep pace with competitors, offshore wind turbine manufacturers continuously develop larger wind turbines instead of improving the present ones which would ensure reliability in harsh offshore environment. Pursuing the logic of larger turbines generating higher energy yield and therefore achieving higher efficiency, this trend is also supported by governmental subsidies under the expectation to bring down the cost of electricity from offshore wind. The aim of this article is to demonstrate that primarily due to the limited wind resource upscaling offshore wind turbines beyond the size of 10 MW (megawatt) is not reasonable. Applying the planning methodology of an offshore wind project developer to a case study wind farm in the German North Sea and assessing energy yield, lifetime project profitability and levelized cost of electricity substantiate this thesis. This is highly interesting for all stakeholders in the offshore wind industry and questions current subsidy policies supporting projects for developing turbines up to 20 MW. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Wind dynamics coupled with that of wave is very important while analyzing an offshore wind turbine support. An effective coupling of finite element software NAOS (Nonlinear Analysis of Offshore Structures developed at Dept. of Ocean Engineering, IIT Madras) with aerodynamic code FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures and Turbulence, developed by NREL, USA) was done to simulate wind-wave coupling. A candidate supporting structure is designed based on basic stability considerations as well as natural frequency ranges. The dynamic response of the structure to various wave and turbine orientations was investigated to get the optimum orientation of structure. Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) corresponding to six degrees of freedom were examined for different wind speed to study the dynamic effect of wind turbine on the system. Some extreme load cases were also simulated to study the response of structure to harsh environment. The results revealed that the proposed structure suits well for the selected site.

The use of a trailing-edge flap is proposed as a supplement to the pitch control to mitigate the load fluctuations of large-scale offshore wind turbines. A wind turbine rotor model with a trailing-edge flap is established by using the free vortex wake (FVW) model. The effects of the deflection angle of the trailing-edge flap on the load distribution of the blades and wake flow field of the offshore wind turbine are analyzed. The wind turbine load response under the control of the trailing-edge flap is obtained by simulating shear wind and turbulent wind conditions. The results show that a better control effect can be achieved in the high wind speed condition because the average angle of attack of the blade profile is small.

At present the proportion of maintenance cost to the total cost for wind turbines is significant particularly for offshore wind turbines (OWT) where this ratio is approximate to 35%. If this ratio is to be reduced in-spite of adverse operating conditions, pre-mature component failures and absence of reliability database for wind turbine components, there is a need to design unconventional maintenance scheme preferably by including novel failure prediction methodologies. Several researchers have advocated the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Bayesian Network Theory (BNT) and other statistical methods to predict failure so as to plan efficient maintenance of wind turbines, however novelty and randomness of failures, nature and number of parameters involved in statistical calculations and absence of required amount of fundamental work required for such advanced analysis have continued to maintain the high cost of maintenance. This work builds upon the benefits of condition monitoring to design methods to predict generic failures in wind turbine components and exhibits how such prediction methods can assist in cutting the maintenance cost of wind turbines. This study proposes using a dedicated tool to assist with failure prediction and planning and execution of wind turbine maintenance. The design and development of such an all-inclusive tool will assist in performing administrative works, inventory control, financial calculations and service management apart from failure prediction in wind turbine components. Its database will contain reference to standard management practices, regulatory provisions, staff details and their skillsets, service call register, troubleshooting manuals, installation guide, service history, details of customers and clients etc. that would cater to multiple avenues of wind turbine maintenance. In order to build such a software package, a robust design of its database is crucial. This work lists prerequisites for choosing a physical database and identifies the benefits of relational database software in controlling large amounts of data of various formats that are stored in such physical databases.

The cost of supporting structure of offshore wind turbines is so high that optimization in the design stage is a basic requirement. Traditional design optimization methodology for offshore structures uses deterministic modeling. However, the existence of uncertainties, such as manufacturing tolerances, material properties, and environmental loads, requires a probabilistic optimization technique. Uncertainties in the offshore wind turbines design process may have a strong effect on its dynamic responses but very little researches have been conducted to incorporate the uncertainty property into design optimization of the supporting structures. In this study, a framework of a dynamic reliability based design optimization for tripod sub-structures was proposed. Firstly, a Finite Element (FE) model of a tripod sub-structure of the NERL 5 MW wind turbine was constructed for dynamic response analysis in time domain and generating several accurate sampling points. Secondly, an efficient approximate model was built utilizing these sampling points to replace the original time consuming dynamic response analysis of FE model. At last, this approximate model was used during the optimum iterative procedure with a global optimization algorithm to gain the final best design point considering uncertainties. In this optimization methodology, some sizes of structural components, applied loads, and some material properties are considered as random variables. The structural stress and natural frequency are considered as constraints and the weight of the structure is considered as the objective function. The reliability of the structure is finally determined through Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that the proposed methodology can obtain a reliable design with better dynamic performance and less weight. Compared with the deterministic optimization, the presented dynamic Reliability Based Design Optimization of tripod substructure of offshore wind turbines is more rational and practical and this efficient methodology can be applied in the design of other similar offshore structures.

Therefore, the method is especially effective for the site with obvious prevailing wind directions. With the Directional Restriction, a wind farm optimization process applying the Multi-Population Genetic Algorithm has been presented. The optimization can exploit the wind resource more effectively and can be used to optimize the layout of nonuniform wind farm. Four representative cases are then studied and discussed: (a) aligned layout with uniform wind turbines; (b) optimized layout with uniform wind turbines; (c) optimized layout with nonuniform wind turbines and (d) a commercial nonuniform offshore wind farm. Through these cases, the utilization rate of a nonuniform wind farm with five types of wind turbines can increase to 99.21%, in which the minimum utilization rate of a single wind turbine is 94.27%. Especially, in the last case, a potential offshore wind farm in Sha Chau Island in Hong Kong is analyzed.

The lagoon hosts a diverse and abundant fish community and other species of commercial importance. Several economical activities are supported by shipping, and as such, vessel traffic within the Ria Formosa lagoon is very intense at some locations during particular seasons of the year, creating high levels of underwater noise. Recently, strong efforts are being made to turn the main inlet of the lagoon, the Faro-Olhao Inlet, a testing site for small scale tidal stream turbines, which will bring an additional source of underwater noise. Underwater noise can be one of a number of factors causing habitat degradation, as it can perturb fish behavior and cause physiological damage. Therefore, in order to comply with underwater noise pollution regulations, tidal energy technology developers are very interested in minimising the introduction of acoustic energy in the environment during the operation of their devices. Under the scope of project SCORE, which involved the deployment and operation of a floating tidal energy converter, this paper presents and discusses the first baseline noise monitoring performed at Ria Formosa. The acoustic data were collected in two occasions over several days, one in the winter and the other in the summer, in 2017.

We first estimated the distances travelled by measuring vertical distribution of swimmers in the water column and their activity in relation to the tidal cycle. We found amphipods were located high over the substratum (up to 4 m) with little vertical structure, and swimming occurred during periods of maximum water velocity (large peak during flood tide). Based on the behaviour of amphipods and information on hydrodynamics, we estimated that an individual could move between 0.4 and 14.4 km toward the upper part of the bay in a single swimming event. This distance is sufficient to allow travel from one mudflat to the next in only a few swimming steps. To identify potential migration routes, we also sampled along a shore (covered in a narrow band of mud) between 2 major mudflats. Patterns in density suggested there was a presence of a travelling wave of individuals, which is consistent with predictions made from their swimming behaviour. We evaluated the possibility that C. volutator in the upper Bay of Fundy are found in one or several metapopulations, where the large and discrete mudflats are connected by the dispersal of individuals. We propose a refined, spatially structured population model (modified from terrestrial metapopulation models) applicable to soft sediment environments in marine intertidal zones, in which several groups of a few intertidal flats are connected by the unidirectional movement of the amphipods. The dynamics will largely be determined by the detailed spatial arrangement of intertidal flats and corridors, as well as by the details of the hydrodynamic conditions and behaviour of organisms.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,12,0,12,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB E4L 1G7, CanadaUniv New Brunswick, Dept Biol, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada",,,,2012-03-28,WOS:000301231500016,,

The current research provides an overview to alleviate the dynamic structural responses of the jacket supported OWT due to the seismic loads associated with static wind and wave loads. Multiple tuned mass damper (MTMD) has been installed at the top and base of the turbine tower corresponding to the mode shapes of the structure. The MTMD parameters have been optimized based on response surface methodology (RSM). The performance of MTMD following the multi-mode control strategy seems to be prominent in suppressing the first two vibrational modes. To evaluate the proposed strategy, frequency response function (FRF), fast Fourier transforms (FFT), peak and lateral displacements of the tower, root mean square (RMS), shear and moment have been investigated through the uncontrolled and controlled structures.

Post-larvae were sampled at 20 sites on cruises in the spring of 1994 and 1995. Modelling included a 'passive' case with particles mixed through the water column, 'active' behaviour mirroring diel and tidal variation in the field, and 'day/night' behaviour where behaviour in the field was averaged across tides. Correlations between model simulations and post-larval distribution were highest in 1995 and were similar amongst the 3 simulations (58 % of variation explained for both the passive and day/night cases). In 1994, variation in the spatial distribution explained was highest for the passive case, intermediate for the active case and lowest for the day/night case. Prevailing winds were quite different between years, with westerlies prevailing in 1994 but significant periods of easterly winds in 1995. These differences were reflected by particle distributions from simulations including behaviour, but were not reflected in post-larval distributions. A negative correlation was found between post-larval abundances and distance from shore. When model predictions and distance from shore were combined in a multiple regression, approximately 70 % of the spatial variation in post-larval abundance was explained in 1995. The results imply that although the passive transport model was an excellent predictor of post-larval abundance in both years, observed vertical migration was not influencing transport, and post-larvae were closer to shore than expected, possibly due to behaviours other than vertical migration.

Vast sea areas with stronger and steadier winds are available for wind farm development and 5 MW wind turbine towers located 20 miles from the coastline are invisible. Current offshore wind turbines are supported by monopoles driven into the seafloor or other bottom mounted structures at coastal sites a few miles from shore and in water depths of 10-15 m.

Therefore, many countries have already owned the offshore wind farms or planned to develop in recent years. Taiwan is going to build the demonstration project including offshore wind turbines and meteorological masts in the western sea of Taiwan. Before installation of wind turbines, site selection and condition survey are request. However, monitoring of wind turbines and ambient environments are also needed to collect data for the operation and the maintenance in the offshore wind farms. We know that Taiwan is a high-risk area with frequent natural disasters, such as typhoons, earthquakes, and monsoon. While the foundation and infrastructure of wind farms are designed and manufactured by higher safety factors to reduce the damage, the environmental impact might increase as well. Generally, the meteorological masts are the main part of environmental monitoring in the offshore wind farms. According to the demonstration project of offshore wind farms in Taiwan, the meteorological masts need some instruments for ocean environmental observations, which are tidal levels, sea surface waves, sea currents, seawater temperatures, salinities, and densities. Most of specifications in those instruments are followed by the IEC International Standard 61400-12-1. Moreover, the demonstration project requests the developers, who are in charge of the meteorological masts have to provide a long term data of 5 years at least. Because those instruments need retrieved and calibrated every 6-12 months. For lower capital expense, we design a seabed-mounted junction box to connect all underwater instruments and reserved an extensive capability for a monitoring network in the future. Moreover, we also integrate more underwater instruments, such as hydrophone for underwater noise measurement and seismometer. Although most of the planned wind farms in Taiwan have avoided away the habitats of the Chinese White Dolphins (Sousa chinensis), the noise impacts are still concerned. Thus, the underwater noises include the piling noise, the shipping noises, the cable laying noises, and the wind turbine operation noises, all of which are highly emphasized in the strategy for environmental impact assessments and monitoring plans. The power supply for those instruments is designed to depend on the rechargeable batteries at the meteorological masts, so those subsystems are designed using low power consumptions. A fiber-optic cable is used for the power and data transmission between the junction box and the meteorological mast. All collected data would be preliminarily processed in the meteorological mast and then transmit via the wireless transmission system to the land station for the owners and end-users.

In addition, the wind turbines' lifespan is not considered as a fixed value, but rather as a stochastic distribution based on historic decommissioning data. This study can support researchers, practitioners and policy makers to understand the future evolution of the blade waste material availability, identify local hotspots and opportunities and assess potential circular economy pathways.The results indicate that wind power capacity in Europe will reach 450 GW in 2050 with the respective total yearly blade waste material reaching 325,000 t. Findings for selected countries reveal that in 2050 Germany will have the majority of blade waste material from onshore wind and the United Kingdom from offshore.

However, as a high-rise structure, the floating wind turbine may sustain large overturning moments induced by wind, wave, current, and towing force in the transport phase. In order to study the stability of the floating wind turbine and the towline force in wet tows, a numerical model of the towing system including a towboat, towline, and STLPWT was established based on multi-body dynamics. Then, the environmental load effects on the towing stability of the floating wind turbine were investigated. In addition, the comparison of the bollard pull and the height of towing points was performed. The results show that the STLPWT was stable under the rough sea towing condition: a significant wave height of 5m and a wind speed of 17 m/s. An appropriate bollard pull should be chosen, in practice, as it involves the time and costs of the towing process. In addition, it may be a better choice to set the height of the towing points near the mean sea level to lower the pitch motions of the STLPWT as well as the towline force.

In this study, seismic fragility analysis of a monopile offshore wind turbine considering different operational conditions was performed. A finite element model for a 5 MW monopile offshore wind turbine was developed using the OpenSees platform. The interaction between the monopile and the seabed soil was modeled as a beam-on-nonlinear-winkler-foundation (BNWF). Anonlinear time history truncated incremental dynamic analysis (TIDA) was conducted to obtain seismic responses and engineering demand parameters. Potential damage states (DSs) were defined as excessive displacement at the nacelle, rotation at the tower top, and the allowable and yield stresses at the transition piece. Fragility curves were plotted to assess the probability of exceeding different damage states. It was found that seismic responses of the wind turbine are considerably influenced by environmental wind and wave loads. Subject to earthquake motions, wind turbines in normal operation at the rated wind speed experience higher levels of probability of exceeding damage states than those in other operational conditions, i. e., in idling or operating at higher or lower wind speed conditions.",,,,,,,,,50,7,0,0,0,0,59,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Dalian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Coastal & Offshore Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R ChinaCharles Sturt Univ, Engn, Fac Business Justice & Behav Sci, Panorama Ave, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia",,,,2017-07-01,WOS:000406700200208,,

This paper presents an initial investigation if load sequence and weather seasonality influence fatigue crack growth for monopile-based offshore wind turbines. Focus is on the load sequence effect introduced by the non-linearity of crack propagation. Fatigue crack growth at two structural hot spots was analyzed with a fracture mechanics model applying Paris' law. The model was calibrated to yield an identical lifetime as a SN-curve analysis. Input into the fracture mechanics model are structural stresses due to environmental and operational loading. Weather seasonality was simulated with a Markov model. Results show that loading sequence has only a negligible effect on crack sizes under the assumption made in this study. This makes fatigue lifetime predictions independent of weather seasonality. However, it becomes relevant for the prediction of future propagation of detected fatigue cracks throughout the year. (C) 2016 The Authors.

An experimental site has been established in an area of mangrove and salt marsh wetland in the Hunter River estuary, Australia, to characterise and provide data for a model of intertidal zone hydrology. The experimental site is designed to monitor water fluxes at a small scale (36 m). A weather station and groundwater monitoring wells have been installed and hydraulic head and tidal levels are monitored over a 10-week period along a short one-dimensional transect covering the transition between the tidal and freshwater systems. Soil properties have been determined in the laboratory and the field. A two-dimensional finite element model of the site was developed using SEEP/W to analyse saturated and unsaturated pore water movement. Modification of the water retention function to model crab hole macropores was found necessary to reproduce the observed aquifer response. Groundwater response to tidal fluctuations was observed to be almost uniform beyond the intertidal zone, due to the presence of highly permeable subsurface sediments below the less permeable surface sediments. Over the 36 m transect, tidal forcing was found to generate incoming fluxes in the order of 0.22 m(3)/day per metre width of creek bank during dry periods, partially balanced by evaporative fluxes of about 0.13 m(3)/day per metre width. During heavy rainfall periods, rainfall fluxes were about 0.61 m(3)/day per metre width, dominating the water balance. Evapotranspiration rates were greater for the salt marsh dominated intertidal zone than the non-tidal zone. Hypersalinity and salt encrustation observed show that evapotranspiration fluxes are very important during non-rainfall periods and are believed to significantly influence salt concentration both in the surface soil matrix and the underlying aquifer.

These operating experiences can serve as a valuable lesson for Korea. After a thorough review, we conclude that the horseshoe vortex's intensity is proportional to the height of the standing waves near an offshore wind turbine. Based on this rationale, we propose a hybrid mono-pile, which is a mono-pile with an additional light turbine mounted at its toe that can dissipate the incoming wave energy with the rotation that occurs when the turbine is exposed to incoming waves or currents. The weakened standing waves in this manner would lead to less sediment transport. We proceeded to carry out the numerical simulation to verify the scouring control effect of the hybrid mono-pile.

We assessed the potential importance of swimming as a factor driving larval morphology by hypothesizing that larvae of the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus are at or near a local maximum in swimming performance as a function of their morphological characteristics. To test this hypothesis, we used a hydrodynamic model parameterized to represent the 4-armed larval stage to predict the consequences of morphological changes on larval movement in still water and shear flows. We created 3 morphological families, consisting of series in which either larval body skeleton volume, relative arm length, or arm elevation angle were incrementally altered from observed morphologies, and used upward swimming velocity as a metric of performance. For each morphological family, a wide subset of alternate morphologies performed better than the observed morphology in still water. However, in shear flows, the observed morphology consistently fell within the narrow morphological range that minimized rapid downward velocities. These results suggest that larval swimming performance, especially performance in moving water, is a driving factor in the evolution of D. excentricus larval morphology. Further, our results suggest that small morphological changes resulting from environmental shifts, such as those predicted to result from ocean acidification, may have potentially large deleterious ecological consequences.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,22,0,25,,,0171-8630,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000287965900016,,

We used a 3-dimensional numerical model to examine the hypothesis that diel vertical migration (DVM) is able to retain larvae of the littoral crab Carcinus maenas over the shelf of the northwestern Iberian upwelling system. Simulations contrasted 2 different wind regimes typical of winter (non-upwelling) and spring (upwelling), and 4 scenarios of vertical distribution: 2 with nocturnal DVM and 2 without DVM. Larvae were simulated as particles released in the model during neap tides at semilunar intervals, to simulate the hatching behaviour of the species, and were followed for 5 wk, which approximates the average larval development time of the species. The particles from the different migration scenarios showed very different responses to wind forcing. Particles without DVM were more sensitive to wind-driven surface currents and were often advected seaward of the shelf break, even during winter when upwelling events were less frequent and of short duration. Particles with DVM were consistently distributed over the shelf, and were very frequently found in the inner shelf region during upwelling. This was accomplished by a larger proportion of time spent in the onshore underflow, which dragged the particles shorewards, than at the surface. The results of the simulations show that, for larvae of littoral species exhibiting DVM over a large expanse of the water column, upwelling may actually be a mechanism that enhances retention over the shelf.",,,,,,,,,100,0,0,0,75,7,125,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aveiro, Dept Fis, P-3810193 Aveiro, PortugalUniv Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000235775700001,,

A nonlinear vortex lattice method (NVLM) was coupled with a vortex particle method (VPM) and used for simulation of the NREL 5-MW wind turbine undergoing periodic motions. Translational (heave, sway, and surge) and rotational (yaw, pitch, and roll) motions were imposed on the wind turbine, and the displacements of the floating platform were defined as a sinusoidal function. Significant variations in the thrust force and power output were observed for the streamwise motions. In addition, the platform motions affected the wake evolution strongly, thus resulting in periodic deformation of the wake structure and the rapid breakdown of helical wake vortices for all motions.

With more than 25,000 wind turbines installed currently, wind power plays an integral role in the development of renewable energy technologies in Germany. In addition to the positive effects, e.g. reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, wind power also has negative effects on the environment and human well-being. With this in mind, it is important to identify most suitable locations for wind turbines that accounts for different aspects of sustainability. The approach suggested here is a practical method to identify sustainable sites at local to national scale. Additionally the paper compares emerging technology (system friendly wind turbines) with standard technology with respect to environmental concerns and assesses the current performance of wind power in a specific study region. The study finds that the approach enables sustainable locations to be identified in a feasible but scientifically robust manner, and that the system friendly technology outperforms the standard technology in each case. The current allocation of wind turbines is less efficient since repowering and reallocation means that more electricity can be generated by fewer turbines. Furthermore, the impact on the environment and human well-being can also be reduced. (C) 2017 The Authors.

This paper explores several larval migratory strategies, synchronised by sensory cues such as pressure, velocity, salinity and solar radiation, in relation to an estuarine axial convergent front - an important circulatory mechanism that forms in many coastal regions where larvae are concentrated; hence these results have implications for fisheries management. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model is applied to an idealised channel, parameterised from observations of a well documented axial convergent front in the Conwy Estuary, UK. The model simulates the bilateral cross-sectional circulation of the front, attributed to the interaction of lateral shear of the longitudinal currents with the axial salinity gradient. Axial surface convergence develops during the flood phase of the tide and (weaker) surface divergence during the ebb phase. Lagrangian Particle Tracking Models subsequently use velocities from a range of simulated tidal and climatic scenarios to track larvae in the estuary. The results show that axial convergent fronts aid estuarine retention of larvae. Specifically retention is enhanced for larvae that experience tidal stream transport and diel migration. Tidally-synchronised larvae exhibit the strongest landward dispersal while the modelled copepod (a combination of tidal and salinity cues) exhibits 'full retention' in the mid-estuary release location. Finally, the vertical migration speed of the larvae must exceed the background vertical velocities in order to get the greatest enhancement of retention. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, for the development of offshore wind energy, more electricity is expected to be generated using wind turbines. This also solves environmental obstacles such as the selection and acquisition of land for a site and the need to protect surrounding sites from noise problems. In this paper, a numerical analysis on the external forces that affects a wind turbine tower is performed, when the wind turbine is installed in a coastal area. To calculate the extreme wind and wave forces, the maximum wind speed is assumed to be 55 m/s, which is observed 10 minutes as the mean maximum wind speed of typhoon Maemi in 2003. During the calculation procedure, the wind force is calculated according to the Korea Building Code 2009. The significant wave height and period are estimated by using the Sverdrup-Munk-Bretschneider (SMB) method. The result data obtained using the SMB method are applied to Morison's equation to compute the wave force. The blade of the wind turbine is designed based on the Blade Element Momentum Theory, and the thrust force of the blade is computed.

The paper uses life cycle assessment (LCA) to estimate the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of onshore and offshore wind turbines with the nominal capacity of 2 MW, to advance our understanding of onshore and offshore wind energy and to inform policy, planning, and investment decisions for future growth of wind power. Results show that the life-cycle GHG emission intensity is 0.082 kg CO2-equivalent (eq)/Mega-joule (MJ) for onshore wind turbine and is 0.130 kg CO2-eq/MJ for offshore wind turbine, respectively. Offshore wind turbine has larger life-cycle GHG emissions than onshore wind turbine, owing to the floating platform fixed in sea. Onshore and offshore wind turbines have much smaller life-cycle GHG emission intensity than coal power plants. If the installed wind turbines in 2014 displace coal, the saved GHG emissions can roughly reach 5.08 x 10(7) t CO2-eq, accounting for 0.09% of global GHG emissions in 2012. The sensitive analysis shows that the lifetime and energy production of wind turbine have large influences on the GHG emission intensity of both onshore and offshore wind turbines, implying that it is an effective way to prolong the lifetime of wind turbine and increase the energy production of wind turbine to reduce the GHG emission intensity of wind turbine. The sensitivity analysis further shows that the distance from wind turbine factory to wind farm site has more significant influence on the life-cycle GHG emission intensities of both onshore and offshore wind turbines than that from wind farm site to the recycling and landfill locations, suggesting that the wind farm site and the wind turbine factory should be as close as possible.

During the life time of an offshore wind turbine, wave and wind can be misaligned which may affect the dynamic response and as a result the functionality of the floating wind turbine. Especially for asymmetric floating structures such as the V-shaped semisubmersible, the misalignment of the wave and wind may result in unexpected behavior. In the present study, integrated aero-hydro-servo-elastic analysis for coupled mooring-floater-turbine is carried out in order to investigate possible effects under misaligned wave and wind conditions. For misaligned wave and wind conditions, the wave-induced as well as the wave-wind-induced motions, tension of mooring lines, and functionality of the turbine such as power production, rotational speed, and controller actions like blade-pitch-angle are studied and presented. The results show that the V-shaped semisubmersible offshore wind turbine is not affected in an undesirable way by the misaligned wave and wind loads in operational conditions and can be considered as enough robust in such environmental conditions. Also, the functionality and power production of the current concept is not affected by the misalignment of the wave and wind. The wave-induced responses of the V-shaped floating wind turbine are relatively small compared to wave-wind-induced responses. The dynamic responses of the V-shaped semisubmersible offshore wind turbine in coupled wave-wind-induced analyses are mainly dominated by the wind loads effects.

The present study focuses on the innovative concept of renewable offshore wind energy to fill the void of high energy demand. The hydrodynamic analysis of Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) is carried out using hydrodynamic analysis module of ANSYS Workbench 14.5 on a Tension Leg Platform (TLP) floater concept which supports 5MW baseline wind turbine. The responses of the platform are investigated by changing the diameter, draft and ballast weight of FOWT under operational wave and wind conditions by considering the combined effect incident at 0 degrees and 45 degrees. It is observed that by maintaining low reserve buoyancy and high metacentric height for TLP FOWT, the mooring forces in cables and the platform draft can be lowered without compromising the responses.

To understand connectivity of the blue crab population, we simulated larval dispersal using a biophysical model driven by high-resolution ocean currents and including early life-history traits of the species. Simulations were conducted during 2015 and 2016, and larvae were released from locations along Florida's GOM and Atlantic coasts. A high degree of local larval retention was observed in Florida's GOM waters, mainly during summer when weak southeastern winds tend to yield a shoreward net flow. Results demonstrated clear evidence of connectivity between the Gulf coast of Florida population and those of Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana, suggesting that the blue crab populations in the GOM are intermixed and the hypothesized boundary (in Florida) of 2 stocks needs further consideration. Outputs of the model also indicated connectivity between the blue crab populations of Florida's Gulf coast and the South Atlantic Bight (SAB). Larval trajectories showed inter-annual variability driven by the interaction of winds, Loop Current (LC) intrusions in the northern GOM, LC eddies and their cyclonic counterparts, and the Mississippi River plume. The latter provides a conduit for larval transport from the GOM to the SAB.

When designing FOWT, it is essential to understand the stability and motion performance of the floater. Water tank model tests are required to evaluate these aspects of performance. This paper describes a model test and numerical simulation for a 750-kW semi-submersible platform wind turbine model-II. In the previous model test, the 750-kW FOWT model-I suffered slamming phenomena from extreme wave conditions. Because of that, the platform freeboard of model-II was increased to mitigate the slamming load on the platform deck structure in extreme conditions. Also, the model-I pitch Response Amplitude Operators (RAO) of simulation had strong responses to the natural frequency region. Thus, the hub height of model-II was decreased to reduce the pitch resonance responses from the low-frequency response of the system. Like the model-I, 750-kW FOWT model-II was built with a 1/40 scale ratio. Furthermore, the experiments to evaluate the performance characteristics of the model-II wind turbine were executed at the same location and in the same environment conditions as were those of model-I. These tests included a free decay test, and tests of regular and irregular wave conditions. Both the experimental and simulation conditions considered the blade rotating effect due to the wind. The results of the model tests were compared with the numerical simulations of the FOWT using FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence) code from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

This paper presents the development of a fuzzy-logic based control system, scalable to consider the effects due to wave converters due to an in-house developed simulation model, for the control of a wind turbine installed on a semi-submersible platform.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,0,14,,,1697-7912,1697-7920,,,,,,,,,,"EnerOcean SL, Bulevar Louis Pasteur 5,Of321, Malaga, SpainUniv Malaga, Dept Ingn Sistemas & Automat, Malaga, SpainUniv Malaga, Dept Ingn Mecan Term & Fluidos, Malaga, Spain",EnerOcean SL,,,2019-10-09,WOS:000487316100010,,

Initially, the wind turbine is introduced, as well as the implemented monitoring system. Then, the main steps of the monitoring system are briefly described. A detailed attention is given to the statistical procedure based on regression models used to minimize the influence of operational and environmental effects over the features used to detect structural changes in the wind turbine. Lastly, the suitability of the system to detect damages is thus assessed, through the analysis of three common damage scenarios: onshore foundation damage; damage by scour on an offshore foundation; and blade damage. It is concluded that the system is capable of detecting damage in onshore and offshore foundations, as well as in rotor blades.

Recent research on wind farms tends to focus on wind flow modelling to enable accurate prediction of power generation. Therefore, this paper presents a quantitative approach to predict a wind farm's lifetime (i) carbon emissions and intensity; (ii) potential energy production; (iii) return on investment and (iv) payback time from an early design perspective. The overall contribution of this work is to develop a quantitative approach to enable the selection of 'greener' designs for reducing the environmental impacts of a wind farm with hub heights between 44 m and 135 m while still considering its economic feasibility assessment.

An unsteady actuator line model (UALM) coupled with a two-phase computational fluid dynamics solver naoe-FOAM-SJTU is applied to solve three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Simulations with different complexities are performed. First, the wind turbine is parked. Second, the impact of the wind turbine is simplified into equivalent forces and moments. Third, fully coupled dynamic analysis with wind and wave excitation is conducted by utilizing the UALM.

Offshore wind turbine support structures are mainly fabricated of welded tubular members, similar to structures used for oil and gas applications, and are exposed to highly dynamic, harsh marine environments. However, their structural details and design requirements are significantly different due to the magnitude and frequency of operational and environmental loadings acting on the support structures. These conditions would significantly affect their structural dynamic response characteristics due to the magnitude of the applied load. This may therefore have some significant effects on the crack growth behaviour and the extent to which corrosion can be associated with damage to the support structures. However, the magnitude of the applied load might depend on turbine size, water depth, soil conditions and type of support structures. It is therefore essential to design wind turbine support structures against prescribed limit states to ensure economical and safe operation.

Existing literature which documents results from previous campaigns is presented, including works referring to oil and gas structures, highlighting the significant difference in the aspects of loading and use of modern fabrication processes, with a view to illustrating the requirements for an update to the existing corrosion fatigue database that will suit offshore wind structures' design requirements.

However, much of this resource resides in waters deeper than 60m where current fixed bottom wind turbine technology is no longer economically viable. As a result, many are looking to floating wind turbines as a means of harnessing this deepwater offshore wind resource. The preferred floating platform technology for this application, however, is currently up for debate. To begin the process of assessing the unique behavior of various platform concepts for floating wind turbines, 1/50th scale model tests in a wind/wave basin were performed at the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN) of three floating wind turbine concepts. The Froude scaled tests simulated the response of the 126m rotor diameter National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) 5 MW, horizontal axis Reference Wind Turbine attached via a flexible tower in turn to three distinct platforms, these being a tension leg-platform, a spar-buoy, and a semisubmersible. A large number of tests were performed ranging from simple free-decay tests to complex operating conditions with irregular sea states and dynamic winds. The high-quality wind environments, unique to these tests, were realized in the offshore basin via a novel wind machine, which exhibited low swirl and turbulence intensity in the flow field. Recorded data from the floating wind turbine models include rotor torque and position, tower top and base forces and moments, mooring line tensions, six-axis platform motions, and accelerations at key locations on the nacelle, tower, and platform. A comprehensive overview of the test program, including basic system identification results, is covered in previously published works. In this paper, the results of a comprehensive data analysis are presented, which illuminate the unique coupled system behavior of the three floating wind turbines subjected to combined wind and wave environments.

So far, mainly corrective or preventive O&M actions are applied. Predictive modelling, however, is expected to significantly enhance existing O&M practice. Here, anticipating wind turbine component failures can enable operators to lower the O&M cost and is particularly useful for wind farms located in remote areas or offshore locations. Previous research has shown that the failure behaviour of wind turbines and their components is highly influenced by the meteorological conditions under which the turbines operate. Hence, there is a significant need for robust models for failure prediction taking into consideration these conditions. Furthermore, solutions need to be found in order to determine the most suitable input variables for enhancing their prediction accuracy.This study uses failure data obtained from 984 wind turbines during 87 operational WT years. Bayesian belief networks (BBN) are trained based on failure records, technology specific covariates, as well as measurements of the environmental and operational conditions at site.

Such turbines may soon become a commercial reality in the UK as a result of both advancements in technology and new financial incentives provided by the government. In addition, microgeneration technologies, especially those with appreciable resource, have the potential to reduce built environment related CO2 emissions coupled with reductions in consumers' electricity costs. In many cases payback on capital investment is within the lifetime of the device. Microwind turbines installed in certain areas in the UK will fit within such criteria. The work presented here addresses modelling of such installations around the UK and presents a methodology to assess the suitability and the economic viability of micro-wind turbines for domestic dwellings. A modelling tool mu-Wind has been developed specifically for studying both energy yields and the payback periods for micro-wind turbines. mu-Wind predicts wind turbine performance prior to installation according to specific power curves either defined by turbine manufacturers or the user. Numerical consideration of wind speed data at specific UK sites was used to estimate energy yields and the results are projected to real electricity demand data from monitored dwellings in the UK. The results show that it is possible to predict with a good degree of accuracy the expected financial payback period for a typical domestic dwelling. Furthermore, the paper postulates that micro-wind technology could have the potential to make a significant impact upon domestic electricity generation when located at the windiest sites in the UK. The likelihood of a proliferation of these turbines in the urban or suburban environment is low but at coastal or inland high elevation sites the technology appears to have a promising future.

The wind farm layout design is becoming increasingly important as the use of wind energy is steadily increasing. Among the many wind farm layout design parameters, the inter-turbine spacing is a key factor in the initial investment cost, annual energy production and maintenance cost. The inter-turbine spacing should be determined to maximize the annual energy production and minimize the wake effect, turbulence effect and fatigue load during the service lifetime of wind turbines. Therefore, some compromise between the aerodynamic power output of wind turbines and the inter-turbine spacing is needed. An actuator disc model with the addition of a momentum source was not used, and instead, a full 3-dimensional model with a tower and nacelle was used for CFD analysis because of its great technical significance. The CFD analysis results, such as the aerodynamic power output, axial direction wind speed change, pressure drop across the rotor of wind turbine, and wind speed deficit due to the wake effect with inter-turbine spacing variation, were studied.

In order to accelerate the deployment of offshore wind farms, costs need to come down. A key contributor to the O&M costs is the component failures and the downtime caused by them. Thus, an understanding is needed on the root cause of these failures. Previous research has indicated the relationship between wind turbine failures and environmental conditions. These studies are using work-order data from onshore and offshore assets. A limitation of using work orders is that the time of the failure is not known and consequently, the exact environmental conditions cannot be identified. However, if turbine alarms are used to make this correlation, more accurate results can be derived. This paper quantifies this relationship and proposes a novel tool for predicting wind turbine fault alarms for a range of subassemblies, using wind speed statistics. A large variation of the failures between the different subassemblies against the wind speed are shown. The tool uses 5 years of operational data from an offshore wind farm to create a data-driven predictive model. It is tested under low and high wind conditions, showing very promising results of more than 86% accuracy on seven different scenarios.

Vertical beaming gave high signal-to-noise ratios (21 dB) during neap tides in the dry season 2002. Despite low Secchi depths, a diel change in the vertical target distribution was apparent when fish inhabited the water column only during the night flooding. Moreover, responses in vertical distribution occurred at dusk and dawn. The multispecies population simultaneously caught with a tidal trap consisted of juveniles and adults of small species, and juveniles of larger species (mean total length of fish: 14 cm), being reflected in target strength values ranging from -60 to -40 dB. Nekton organisms usually traveled with the tide. At low water fish concentrated in the subtidal channel sections, swain slowly and meandered in different directions. At first flood rise-the strongest ambient change-the entire fish population 'rode the tide' to immigrate into the intertidal zone, indicated by fast, linear, upstream tracks throughout the water column. At slack high water fish milled around (likely Cetengraulis edentulus and Anchovia clupeoides at night and epibenthic fish in daytime). When sampling the spatiotemporal distribution of fish in intertidal environments, the 3D spatial heterogeneity versus time should be considered. A net upstream longitudinal current together with a regular first flood rise likely promoted retention of fish in this mangrove nursery from one tide to the next. In well-mixed shallow-water environments with a dominant epibenthic fish population, horizontal and vertical beaming should be combined since deeper sections may serve as a refuge for the fish.

Hence, understanding the mechanisms of airfoil noise generation, demands access to sophisticated numerical tools. The processes of modeling wind farm noise include three steps: (1) The whole wind farm velocity distributions are modelled with an improved Jensen's wake model; (2) The individual wind turbine's noise is simulated by a semi-empirical wind turbine noise source model; (3) Propagations of noise from all wind turbines are carried out by solving the parabolic wave equation.

The LCoE is used as the evaluation index to identify whether it is economical to invest in such a way.

To investigate whether the presence of food in the vicinity of wind turbines may result in behaviors that increase the risk of collision, feeding experiments were carried out at a safe location in Hokkaido from 2014 to 2016. For both white-tailed and Steller's sea eagles H. pelagicus, the frequency of flying looking downwards increased when the food was placed on the ground. Furthermore, the frequency of interference by other individuals also increased with feeding. It is known that eagles can visually recognize the wind turbines in front of them, but that they cannot recognize the structures when flying looking downwards. These results suggest that the presence of food in the vicinity of turbines induces behaviors that may increase the collision risk with wind turbines for both white-tailed and Steller's sea eagles.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1880-1587; 1880-1595,,,,,,,,,,,"Japan Bird Res Assoc, 1-29-9 Sumiyoshi, Fuchu, Tokyo, 1830034, Japan",,,,2016-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15408050404,,

A simplified structural model, considering the degree-of-freedom of platform pitch and surge, tower tilt and TMD translation, is proposed in the light of motion features of semi-submersible platform. After identifying ten unknown parameters, the correctness of the deterministic model is validated by pitch free decay responses. The mass, stiffness and damping of TMD are optimized using both method of exhaustion and genetic algorithm to avoid local minimum. Six optimized TMD devices are evaluated under three kinds of realistic environment conditions. The control effectiveness is assessed by the extreme and fatigue response reduction ratios.

Several technical solutions exist to exploit wind energy, such as floating vertical axis wind turbines (F-VAWTs), which provide an attractive and cost-effective solution for exploiting higher resources of offshore wind in deep water areas. Recently, the use of the Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) offshore has attracted increased interest because it offers significant advantages over horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs). In this context, this article presents a new concept of floating Darrieus-type straight-bladed turbine with three-stage rotors.

This study also allows to identify a low solidity turbine (sigma = 0.3), offering the best aerodynamic performance, while a two-bladed design is recommended.

To gain first insights which effect these substantial changes in habitat structure and diversity might have on faunal stocks settling on hard substrata, we compared the mobile demersal megafauna associated with the common types of wind turbine foundations ('jacket', 'tripod' and 'monopile with scour protections of natural rock') in the southern German Bight, North Sea. Monopiles with scour protection were mostly colonized by typical reef fauna. They were inhabited by an average of about 5000 edible crabs Cancer pagurus (per foundation), which is more than twice as much as found at the foundation types without scour protection. Strong evidence was found that all three foundation types not only function as aggregation sites, but also as nursery grounds for C. pagurus. Assuming equal shares of the three foundation types in future wind farms, we project that about 27% of the local stock of C. pagurus might be produced on site. When, for example, comparing the existing fauna at 1000 ship wrecks and on the autochthonous soft substrate with those which probably will establish at the foundations of 5000 hypothetically realized wind turbines, it becomes clear that the German Bight in the future will provide new artificial reef habitats for another 320% crabs (C. pagurus) and 50% wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) representing substrata-limited mobile demersal hard bottom species.

However, to calculate the fatigue lifetime of wind turbines, numerous time domain simulations for different load cases with changing environmental conditions are necessary. According to the state of the art, wind speed bins (of 2ms(-1)) are employed, while keeping all other environmental states constant. However, assuming constant parameters in each wind speed bin is an unfounded simplification. Therefore, in this study, methodologies for fatigue assessment considering scattering environmental conditions are investigated by assuming statistical distributions for environmental conditions for all wind speeds that are derived using real data measured at the North Sea research platform FINO3. These statistical distributions are used to conduct time domain simulations of an OC3 monopilewith a 5-MW wind turbineusing the aero-servo-hydro-elastic simulation framework FAST. The fatigue lifetime is calculated, and its uncertainty due to finite sampling is assessed. It is shown that if scattering environmental states in each wind speed bin are applied, the uncertainty due to finite sampling is significant. Furthermore, only some wind speed bins contribute to the overall fatigue damage. Based on these findings, in a last step, different Monte Carlo sampling concepts are investigated to reduce the number of simulations needed to calculate the fatigue lifetime with a defined uncertainty. By combining several wind speed bins and by sampling according to the damage distribution, it is proved that the number of simulations can be reduced by more than 30% without increasing the uncertainty.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,0,18,,,1095-4244,1099-1824,,,,,,,,,,"Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Struct Anal, Appelstr 9a, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",,,,2018-10-29,WOS:000447168300010,,

This work begins to address this problem by presenting the validation of a model constructed in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) floating wind turbine simulator FAST with 1/50th-scale model test data for a semi-submersible floating wind turbine system. The test was conducted by the University of Maine DeepCwind program at Maritime Research Institute Netherlands' offshore wind/wave basin, located in the Netherlands. The floating wind turbine used in the tests was a 1/50th-scale model of the NREL 5-MW horizontal-axis reference wind turbine with a 126m rotor diameter. This turbine was mounted to the DeepCwind semi-submersible floating platform. This paper first outlines the details of the floating system studied, including the wind turbine, tower, platform, and mooring components. Subsequently, the calibration procedures used for tuning the FAST floating wind turbine model are discussed. Following this calibration, comparisons of FAST predictions and test data are presented that focus on system global and structural response resulting from aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads. The results indicate that FAST captures many of the pertinent physics in the coupled floating wind turbine dynamics problem. In addition, the results highlight potential areas of improvement for both FAST and experimentation procedures to ensure accurate numerical modeling of floating wind turbine systems.

An innovative hybrid monopile foundation for OWTs is proposed. The concept has a wider adaptability by using established knowledge to solve for new problems. A series of centrifuge tests is performed to investigate the behavior of this hybrid foundation system in extreme and service conditions. OWTs with the original monopile foundation as well as the wheel-only foundations are tested for comparisons, and two clay profiles are considered. The test results show that the hybrid monopile foundation provides larger ultimate bearing capacities compared to the traditional foundations. Two analytical methods are proposed to estimate the ultimate bearing capacity of this innovative design, and the results are calibrated by the centrifuge tests. In service conditions, the hybrid monopile foundation shows stronger cyclic resistances. Influence factors of the cyclic responses are summarized. An analytical solution is put forward to estimate the accumulated lateral displacement of the hybrid monopile foundation. A degradation factor is suggested based on the results of the centrifuge tests. The study aims to enrich the understanding of the innovative foundation concept and to provide design references for practical applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

One obstacle to the more widespread installation of offshore wind turbines in the USA, however, is that recent projections of offshore operations and maintenance costs vary from two to five times the land-based costs. One way in which these costs could be reduced is through use of a structural health and prognostics management (SHPM) system as part of a condition-based maintenance paradigm with smart loads management. This paper contributes to the development of such strategies by developing an initial roadmap for SHPM, with application to the blades. One of the key elements of the approach is a multiscale simulation approach developed to identify how the underlying physics of the system are affected by the presence of damage and how these changes manifest themselves in the operational response of a full turbine. A case study of a trailing edge disbond is analysed to demonstrate the multiscale sensitivity of damage approach and to show the potential life extension and increased energy capture that can be achieved using simple changes in the overall turbine control and loads management strategy. The integration of health monitoring information, economic considerations such as repair costs versus state of health, and a smart loads management methodology provides an initial roadmap for reducing operations and maintenance costs for offshore wind farms while increasing turbine availability and overall profit.

A vertical cylinder on the top of an elliptical sphere forms the principal configuration of the platform. The analysis of the dynamic performance of an example platform with 5 MW wind turbine by means of the well-established linear theory for the dynamics of marine constructions in waves shows that the platform is able to secure the normal function of the wind turbine in waves up to rough sea state and has the required dynamic performance for survival in extreme waves by adopting a survival ballast condition. An important feature of this concept is that reinforced concrete can be used as cost-efficient construction material so that the service life, several times longer than similar steel constructions can be obtained despite of the marine corrosive and erosive environment. Thus, this kind of platform can become competitive in the economical, sustainable, and environment-friendly aspect. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Owing to the increasingly limited possibilities for using on-land turbines, offshore wind generation is a potential alternative. However, wind turbines located offshore are still associated with visual disamenities potentially making offshore location a less attractive alternative to on-land wind power generation. The present paper analyses attitudes towards both on-land and offshore wind power development using a probit model. It also discusses the elicited determinants of attitude in relation to developing wind power on-land or offshore. Compared to other papers on attitude, the paper is unique in the sense that the Danish population has considerable experience with the different impacts associated with wind turbines compared to most of the other countries investing in wind power generation. This is particularly evident with regards to offshore development. The paper establishes that whilst offshore wind farms are preferred to on-land development, the results also imply that on-land development is still a feasible alternative. In that relation, differences in wind power generation costs and the substitution of smaller on-land turbines with fewer but larger turbines might make on-land development even more attractive. On a more detailed level, younger respondents are more positive towards wind power than older respondents. Interestingly, respondents living close to either on-land or offshore wind turbines did not display a more negative attitude towards wind power generation when compared to respondents who were not living close to wind turbines.

Given the large sizes of turbines and the high complexity of ocean engineering systems, optimizing the supporting structures of offshore wind turbines can significantly save costs while enabling the structures to survive the severe ocean environment. The type of RDO used in our study focuses on reducing the structural weight of a turbine and lowering its variation to achieve stable (or robust) operation and minimal cost. To save computational costs, the design of experiment process was introduced for sensitivity analysis of the design variables and the arrangement of sampling points. The metamodel technology including the Kriging model was used in this study to replace the time-consuming finite element model for dynamic response analysis. A simple test case using a cantilever was introduced first for briefly illustrating the validity of the RDO framework method. Deterministic optimization (DO), which does not consider uncertainties, was conducted simultaneously for comparison. Subsequently, the numerical case of a tripod-type supporting structure of a 5 MW offshore wind turbine was built for formal optimization. The comparison revealed that the reliability of constraints in RDO was much higher than that in DO, whereas the standard deviation in RDO was lower, implying that robust and reliable design results were obtained even under the influence of uncertainties.

This paper presents a multi-robot-approach for automated wind turbine maintenance including a novel climbing robot. Currently, wind turbine maintenance remains a manual task, which is monotonous, dangerous, and also physically demanding due to the large scale of wind turbines. Technical climbers are required to work at significant heights, even in bad weather conditions. Furthermore, a skilled labor force with sufficient knowledge in repairing fiber composite material is rare. Autonomous mobile systems enable the digitization of the maintenance process. They can be designed for weather-independent operations. This work contributes to the development and experimental validation of a maintenance system consisting of multiple robotic platforms for a variety of tasks, such as wind turbine tower and rotor blade service. In this work, multicopters with vision and LiDAR sensors for global inspection are used to guide slower climbing robots. Light-weight magnetic climbers with surface contact were used to analyze structure parts with non-destructive inspection methods and to locally repair smaller defects. Localization was enabled by adapting odometry for conical-shaped surfaces considering additional navigation sensors. Magnets were suitable for steel towers to clamp onto the surface. A friction-based climbing ring robot (SMART- Scanning, Monitoring, Analyzing, Repair and Transportation) completed the set-up for higher payload. The maintenance period could be extended by using weather-proofed maintenance robots. The multi-robot-system was running the Robot Operating System (ROS).

Additionally the following acronyms are used in the Excel work and throughout this introduction:- WT(s) = Wind Turbine(s)- WF(s) = Wind Farm(s)sheet 2 - EU WFsData from Zhang et al. [1] have been verified and updated by accessing the main information of the wind farms (see link in reference in the section). In particular, for each project, the following information are reported: - WF name, capacity and country - number of WTs - WTs manufacturer/type - type of control, gearbox, generator, and converter - year when WF was online - average distance from shore - current status of the WFsheet 3 - EU WFs (Fully-Grid Connected)The fully-grid connected, and still in operation, wind farms are selected out of the ones listed in sheet 1. In the main table (Range(A1:N83)), the WTs are identified in the four drivetrain types (and type D sub-types), defined by Perez et al. [4] (N2:N83). A table reporting the acronyms for the if cycle on the WT characteristics (speed, gearbox and generator) is reported in cells Range(AH2:AL11).Based on this latter, cells in Range(Q1:AD84) contain if cycles for identifying the share of each drivetrain type on the total installed capacity. The results are plotted in a pie chart, gathering type A and B. Finally, the table in Range(AS1:CA86) wants to verify how much of the actual installed (fully-grid connected) capacity is accounted in this dataset.

In this work, a tapered beam model is proposed to investigate the dynamic response of an offshore wind turbine tower on the monopile foundation assembled with rotating blades in the complex ocean environment. Several environment factors like wind, wave, current, and soil resistance are taken into account. The proposed model is analytically solved with the Galerkin method. Based on the numerical results, the effects of various structure parameters including the taper angle, the height and thickness of the tower, the depth, and the diameter and the cement filler of the monopile on the fundamental natural frequency of the wind turbine tower system are investigated in detail. It is found that the fundamental natural frequency decreases with the increase in the taper angle and the height and thickness of the tower, and increases with the increase in the diameter of the monopile. Moreover, filling cement into the monopile can effectively improve the fundamental natural frequency of the wind turbine tower system, but there is a critical value of the amount of cement maximizing the property of the monopile.

The aim of this multiphase mixed methods study is to explore the perceived accuracy of images that represent the visual impacts of both onshore and offshore wind farms. Field visits and data from a public survey are used to assess the accuracy of visualisations and to examine the effect of camera lens focal length on perception of scale of wind turbines. Results show that panoramic photomontages are perceived as the least accurate, while images taken at 75 mm focal length in full frame format are perceived as the most accurate form of representation of the scale and visual impact of wind turbines. These findings imply that the panoramic visualisation technique, which has been used for decades to predict the scale of wind turbines in VIAs, is ineffective in predicting accurately the visual impact of wind farms, and an alternative predictive technique is needed. For wind farm visualisations the use of 75 mm full frame image format is recommended in order to improve the accuracy, enable better informed decision making and avoid the loss of credibility of visualisations and VIAs.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,0,9,,,0195-9255,1873-6432,,,,,,,,,,"Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, EnglandUniv East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, EnglandUCL, Ctr Urban Sustainabil & Resilience, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",,,,2019-04-03,WOS:000462108800001,,

Additionally, offshore environment is tremendously severe and place high demands not only on the strength of the turbine blade structural design but also in the need of reliable blade monitoring systems.

The purpose of this publication is to develop and present a methodology in order to tackle some of the challenges and problems to be solved before a full system can be proved capable of detecting critical damage in blades. The proposed system is based on an active sensor network where feature extraction, sensor data fusion and statistical baseline modelling are synergically evaluated for the purpose of damage detection within the context of pattern recognition-based structural health monitoring (SHM).

The analysis method for long term loading and assessment of fatigue capacity has been improved over the years and this has also resulted in need for new and revised design standards.New types of structures and structural components have been developed like tension leg platforms and support structures for wind turbines. These structures are subjected to significant dynamic loading such that fatigue design becomes the main issue and relevant fatigue design standards are needed.Fatigue assessment of fixed offshore structures in the North Sea has been standard practice since the 1970s. Fatigue of floating platforms became a requirement after the accident with the Alexander Kielland platform in 1980.

Starting from a bottom-up cost model, the paper advances the methodology by identifying the techno-economic variables responsible for cost reductions of individual components (in $/kW) and linking them to drivers, specifically: learning by deployment, learning-by-researching, supply-chain dynamics, and market dynamics. The analysis finds that changes in materials (copper, fiberglass, and iron), labour (employee productivity), legal and financial costs contributed over 30% to the cost reduction of wind turbine prices over the period 2005-2017. Moreover, learning-by-deployment was the most important innovation driver, being responsible for half of the cost reduction. The findings point to the importance of policies tailored to technology's stage of development.

Therefore, expediting the turbine-structure mating operations through a higher level of automation in offshore wind turbine installations may provide important economic benefits. To achieve a higher automation level and reduce the weather waiting time during the installation of offshore wind turbines, a flexible simulation-verification framework with high fidelity is needed.

It has been readily accepted not only for its purely navigational merits but also as a ship management tool. At this stage, it cannot yet fulfil its promise of showing dynamically all the Time Varying Objects (TVO) as the IMO/IHO requirements specifically forbid dynamic representation of tidal heights. However, the first step towards changing this situation has been made with the preparation of tidal overlays for ECDIS by some forward looking ECDIS manufacturers,The tidal overlay for ECDIS has multiple advantages over its predecessor - the printed tide tables. In addition to the provision of the official tidal predictions it can model tidal heights for any given time and place rather than just the extremes of height at the standard ports. The same applies to tidal streams or currents at the critical locations. The system will be also capable of interfacing with the real or near-real time data provided by short-term forecasts, shore transmitters or satellites. Dynamic representation of flows, both tidal and non-tidal is expected to precede that of tidal heights, as there is no IMO/IHO restriction on this information. It is expected that the regulation forbidding dynamic representation of tidal heights will be removed as the users voice their requirements.Incorporation of other TVO into ECDIS is also discussed. The latest developments in the field of TVO seem to promise an easy transition to a fully dynamic, four-dimensional ECDIS of the future. Several problems however, both technical and organisational, will have to be solved before this goal can be achieved. On one side there will be a need for providing interfaces with real-time or near real-time information sources, short term forecast models and other data providers, and for developing the necessary standards. On the other, the relevant Hydrographic Offices will have to determine the extent of tidal data applications, current and tide area encoding limits, methodology of supplying TVO data, etc. In some instances, where the HOs cannot provide these services, a Regional ENC Coordinating Centre (RENC) or commercial organisations may be required to help out.In addition, we have to remember that this will be a continuing learning process for all participants - IHO, Hydrographic Offices, ECDIS developers, and the navigators - especially after the ENC is widely accepted as a standard equal to that of the paper chart and the new ideas and additional requirements start flooding in from the users.",,,,,Oceans 97 MTS/IEEE ConferenceOceans 97 MTS/IEEE Conference,"OCT 06-09, 1997OCT 06-09, 1997",IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; Marine Technol SocIEEE Ocean Engn Soc; Marine Technol Soc,"HALIFAX, CANADAHALIFAX, CANADA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,0-7803-4108-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,1997-01-01,WOS:A1997BJ68T00168,,

Overall, we find very little impact of coastal wind turbines on aggregate recreational visitation; loss in annual consumer surplus associated with wide spread wind development in the coastal zone is insignificant at $17 (or about 1.5% of annual consumer surplus). Results suggest that NC local coastal tourists are averse to wind farms in the near-shore zone; average compensating variation for wind farms one mile from the shore is estimated at $55 per household.

Nevertheless, the exploitation of small turbines usually faces with several shortcomings and the actual return is often lower than expected, mainly because the power curve given by the manufacturer usually does not reproduce the actual behaviour of the turbines during the operating conditions.Using high-resolution wind speed and energy production measurements, this paper presents an in situ experimental analysis of two small size wind turbines with the same rated power, placed in the same urban environment and realized with vertical and horizontal axis, respectively. Wind conditions are particularly interesting as they are characterized by two distinct regimes, corresponding to low (wind blowing from the sea) and high turbulence (wind blowing from the land).The detected power production is discussed, showing the mutual strengths and weaknesses of the two technologies, focusing on the role of the technical features and control apparatus on the one hand and of the incoming wind conditions and turbulence on the other.

This paper analyses the possibilities to extrapolate results from fatigue reassessment of wind turbines at selected design positions to other wind turbines of the wind farm. Five monopile-based turbines placed in a generic offshore wind farm were assessed with integrated aero-hydro-elastic simulations. A fatigue assessment was performed for each out of the five selected turbines using site specific environmental data commonly available during the design process. The results were compared to a fatigue reassessment where environmental data were modified in order to account for changes in environmental conditions during the service lifetime of the wind turbines. Results indicate that an extrapolation is feasible for selected parameters when changes in environmental conditions are small. This is an important step towards an effective and efficient assessment methodology for lifetime extension of offshore wind turbines. (C) 2017 The Authors.

This was true on average but not for all study participants. Two key determinants of preferences were spatial proximity to the proposed wind farm and perceptions of the visual impacts of wind turbines.

Exposure to open sea wave climates with high wave-current interactions will influence the power generating, structural integrity, product durability and maintenance requirements of the technologies deployed. The research will undertake both experimental and numerical analyses in a manner that will make the results and findings transferable to real-life implementations. This will inform developers of the peak and fluctuating loads that devices are exposed to in a commercial array environment and will also identify and test mitigating actions to be implemented in order to ensure the robustness and sustainability of the array. The dynamic, cyclic loadings on a tidal stream turbine have been shown to depend on the current profile and wave characteristics which can increase the severity of these loads. This must be considered in the design of the turbine. A turbine in an array will be subjected to more complex flows due to its position in the array, which will result in more diverse loading patterns, which must be fully understood by the turbine designers and operators. The project will therefore evaluate and measure the loading and performance of different configurations of tidal stream turbine arrays using numerical modelling and model scaled experiments. The numerical modelling will use fluid and structural modelling. An existing and proven, instrumented, laboratory scale turbine design will used for the tests. Initial work on a three turbine array will be undertaken to create models of a full-scale turbine array to determine the power output, loading patterns and accurate life-fatigue analysis based on realistic site deployment conditions. This information will be formulated to provide a basis for the industry to evaluate anticipated performance, monitoring needs, operational best practice and maintenance regimes in order to deliver the lowest cost of energy from tidal arrays",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/N020782/1,,,,,,,,Cardiff University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15339265,,

To the north and northwest of Anglesey (approximately 11-16 nautical miles (nm) offshore) four such areas had been identified by the British Geological Survey, covering an area of approximately 140km2 (Graham et al., 2001). These mapped areas, which were identified as potential bedrock or stony reef, defined the four Survey Areas for this project. It was also anticipated that areas of biogenic reef may also be found within the survey areas, due to historic records of Modiolus modiolus in the vicinity. Between 9 and 14 August 2005, JNCC, in collaboration with the Countryside Council for Wales and University College Cork, surveyed these four areas from the Celtic Voyager. High resolution multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data were obtained for all four survey areas. Seventeen grab samples were obtained in three of the four survey areas. None were taken in Area 3. Twenty-nine video tows were obtained from all four survey areas. The results from the current study suggest that the seabed in this study area was broadly characterised by complex topography and mixed sediment mosaics, which were home to benthic communities in tide swept environments. Analysis of the infaunal component of the grab samples showed that all samples belonged to the same biotope, Mediomastus fragilis, Lumbrineris spp. and venerid bivalves in circalittoral coarse sand or gravel (SS.SCS.CCS.MedLumVen). This community was characterised by the sea spider Achelia echinata, the bristle worms Aonides paucibranchiata and Mediomastus fragilis, the polychaetes Harmothoinae, and the common mussel Mytilus edulis.A range of biological communities were determined from the video analysis. Some were typical of boulder areas subjected to moderate tidal streams, and were typified by faunal crusts, including species such as the bryozoan Flustra foliacea, the soft coral Alcyonium digitatum, hydroids and other encrusting fauna. In one of the survey areas, very high densities of the brittle star Ophiothrix fragilis, along with lower numbers of Ophiocomina nigra, were present, blanketing the underlying rocky substrate. Gravelly substrates were also common throughout the survey areas, supporting biological communities that did not easily match existing biotopes within the Marine Habitat Classification. Faunal and substrate observations made throughout the survey area were relatively comparable with those observed in other studies nearby, as well as with some of the biotope predictions made by the HABMAP project. All of these studies indicated a highly complex area, with mixed sediments and biotopes mosaics occurring within small areas that could not be easily discerned without fine scale ground-truthing work. Annex I reef was observed in patches throughout the four study areas, although these were concentrated in two of the four survey areas, with the other two areas having only a few small patches of isolated reef habitat. Where Annex I reef was found, it was comprised of boulders and cobbles, which although scoured in places, supported epifauna such as Pomatoceros triqueter/lamarcki and Alcyonium digitatum, with hydroids such as Abietinaria abietina also common. Along video tows, reef habitat tended to alternate with more gravelly areas of non reef habitat.No biogenic reefs (formed by either Modiolus modiolus or Sabellaria spinulosa) were encountered through the survey. Although Annex I reef was found in a number of locations, indicating that this could be an area of conservation interest, further work is required to compare the results of the current study with other known areas of reef within the Irish Sea, in order to decide on the most appropriate site for consideration as an SAC.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2008-10-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14504026701,,

Offshore wind energy production faces a wide range of new challenges in design, development, manufacturing, installation, and maintenance and operation. The need, objectives, method, benefits, and application of a proposed reliability and maintainability database are identified in this paper. In the offshore oil and gas industry the OREDA concept for data collection has been running for more than 25 years. Therefore it will be briefly described what is considered to be the state of the art in this industry when it comes to data collection. Potential challenges and issues pertaining to the reliability and maintainability data collection of offshore wind turbines are outlined and categorized. The architecture of the proposed database is illustrated. The main building blocks of the database are briefly described and their possible effects on the reliability and maintainability of offshore wind turbines are highlighted. It is expected that the realization of the proposed database will open a new vista of knowledge in understanding the real behavior of offshore wind turbines in the marine environment.

Among other constraints, the lack of a specific policy framework promoting this emerging sector is often pointed to as the main barrier for MRE grid penetration. This paper assesses the Spanish MRE sector, in terms of resource availability, government plans, policy regulations, and projects undertaken, with a view to establish a comparison with the situation in other European countries. In particular, the United Kingdom is used as a case study to analyze ongoing research activities, pilot projects, and lessons learned. As a result, it is found that public funding needs to be increased; the economic crisis should be seen as an opportunity for job creation and industrial development rather than a barrier; administrative procedures must be simplified and cross-national cooperation should be increased.

However, performance of the turbines under actual field environments may significantly differ from the manufacturer's power curves, which are derived under 'standard' conditions. In case of existing wind projects with sufficient performance data, the velocity-power variations can better be defined using artificially intelligent models. In this paper, we compare the performance of four such models by applying them to a 2-MW onshore wind turbine. Models based on ANN, KNN, SVM and MARS were developed and tested using the SCADA data collected from the turbine. All the AI models performed significantly better than the manufacturer's power curve. Among the AI methods, SVM-based predictions showed the highest accuracy. A site-specific performance curve for the turbine, based on the SVM model, is presented. Wider adaptability of this approach has been demonstrated by successfully implementing the model for a 3.6-MW wind turbine, working under offshore environment.

Performance levels ranging from undamaged to near collapse of the jacket supported OWT are defined and are assessed using static pushover analysis of the support structure for given wind and wave conditions.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Using multibeam sonar to monitor animal behaviour and environmental interactions at marine renewable energy sites,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2020,2020,"To date, there are 8.5 GW of installed UK offshore wind capacity, and it is estimated 20% of current UK electricity demand could be met with wave and tidal stream sources. However, with rapid development of marine renewable energy (MRE) including wind, wave and tidal stream energy, uncertainty remains surrounding the environmental and ecological effects. Concerns include disruption of migratory and foraging animal behaviour, direct mortality from animal collision with underwater turbines, attraction of animals as a result of prey aggregation around structures, or displacement from preferred habitats. Changes in behaviour of fish species, in particular those which are common prey of seabirds and marine mammals, could lead to changes in foraging behaviour of their predators as observed at offshore wind turbines. A recent study found 1.75 times higher fish school (prey) passage rates at tidal turbine structures, and 5.66 times higher in low speed wakes [1]. However, key questions remain about whether these increases in prey abundance are reflected in changes in predator numbers or behaviour; understanding potential predator responses also has important consequences for collision risk with either above water (wind) or below water (tidal) turbine blades. Regulators need information on animal distribution, underwater behaviour and interactions with marine energy developments to inform licensing and management.Multibeam sonar mounted on seabed platforms has been demonstrated as a suitable method to investigate these knowledge gaps [2-4], providing continuous, fine-scale information on the behaviour, distribution and interactions of fish, diving seabirds and marine mammals, including predator-prey behaviour. This inter-disciplinary PhD will develop algorithms for multibeam sonar data processing for target detection, tracking and classification in high energy sites. The project will build on several existing datasets allowing investigation of the transferability of techniques and results between sites / devices / instruments. Analysis of the results will address key ecological and regulator questions on predator-prey interactions, animal behaviour, and biophysical coupling at MRE sites. The project will also develop recommendations for future data collection to ensure measurements can effectively meet monitoring requirements in collaboration with the project partner Marine Scotland Science. A robust and transferable suite of processing tools will address industry uncertainty and answer the crucial ecological questions on the environmental effects of MRE development. The student will be able to engage in future data collection opportunities to apply the techniques and recommendations.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2452463,,,,,,,,University of the Highlands and Islands,University of the Highlands and Islands,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15334561,,

The topic is addressed by identifying the most significant objectives, targets and issues, as well as the optimization formulations, schemes and models available in the published literature.The current energy demand combined with depletion of fossil-fuel reserves and stricter environmental regulations have led to the development of alternative renewable energy solutions like wind energy. The current 2030 United States target is to have at least 20% of the US energy supply by onshore and offshore wind farms. To meet these demands, wind energy costs have to be able to compete with traditional fossil fuel sources. Hence, it is essential and vital that wind turbine designers and manufactures search the optimal solution that fits the objectives under a set of design constraints. Throughout the last 30 years, the objective function has evolved from the earlier maximized metric of the power coefficient to the maximization of the annual energy production. Common alternatives such as blade mass minimization and maximization of the rotor thrust and torque have been examined. However, the main objective has been focused on the minimization of the cost of energy in order for wind energy to become more competitive and economically attractive.The purpose of this paper is to review previous work that undertakes the performance optimization of horizontal wind turbines by highlighting the main aspects when tackling the wind turbine optimization problem such as: objective functions, design constraints, tools and models and optimization algorithms. In addition, in a conclusion of the review, a discussion and argument about the challenges, issues and future developments are identified. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

According to our results the majority of people perceive wind energy positively and prefer offshore wind farms. People recognise the importance of preserving landscape and think that wind turbines do not improve its beauty. In this respect the installation of new wind farms can be considered a second-best solution in terms of landscape preservation, but a first-best solution if other aspects are taken into account .",,,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,4,0,29,,,1592-6117,1724-2118,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Padua, TESAF, Dipartimento Territorio & Sistemi Agro Forestali, Padua, Italy",,,,2014-06-01,WOS:000216323800002,,

Particularly, floating offshore wind turbines possess great potential in deep water coastal places around the world, though they are now still in the demonstration phase. At the same time, the unused wave energy is also abundant at the sites of offshore wind farms, especially those in deep sea regions. Collecting wave energy in offshore windfarms might benefit both total energy production and reduce maintenance cost. Therefore, integrating offshore wind turbine with wave energy conversion devices could be a good idea to achieve higher efficiency and lower cost.In this paper, we report a combined wind and wave energy power generation concept called WindOWC, which constits of a 5MW wind turbine and three oscillating-water-column (OWC) wave energy converters (WECs). The wind turbine is mounted on a semi-submersible floating platform, which is similar to OC4-semibsubmersible, and the OWCs are located in its three offset columns. In this design, the wind turbine and WECs share the same supporting platform and the power transmission system, thus is expected to reduce the cost of energy. Also, it is possible the OWCs may improve the platform dynamic performance by providing positive damping through controlling the air turbine rotational speed. In this work, we describe the geometry properties of the proposed WindOWC concept and conduct preliminary hydrodynamic analysis using potential flow theory. The ANSYS AQWA is used to obtain the system dynamic responses in frequency and time domain, respectively. The OWC dynamics and expected positive damping from them will be investigated in the future.",,,,,"38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)","JUN 09-14, 2019JUN 09-14, 2019","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine EngnASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn","Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLANDUniv Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLAND",3,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,2153-4772,,978-0-7918-5889-9,,,,,,,,,"Zhejiang Univ, Inst Ocean Engn & Technol, Ocean Coll, Zhoushan, Peoples R China",,,,2020-03-10,WOS:000513310000056,,

As the capacity of wind turbine assembly increases, the blade diameter of the matching wind turbine needs to be increased correspondingly to obtain more wind energy. Taking offshore wind turbine as a representative, the blade diameter of some wind turbines has reached more than 100 meters. When the blade diameter becomes larger, it will bring a series of problems. The main performance is that the elasticity and flexibility of wind turbine tower, transmission shaft, blades and other main components will increase correspondingly, while the damping value of power electronic components will be smaller. These problems make the fatigue load variable of large wind turbine more complex, winch will lead to the low frequency mode of the unit The more complex the modes arc, the more complex they are. When the diameter of the wind turbine increases, the pitch angle increases due to tower shadow effect, wind shear and turbulence time-varying factors, which causes the blade to swing and shimmy more significantly, and then causes the fatigue load condition of the wind turbine to be more obvious, which seriously affects the mechanical stress intensity change between various transmission mechanisms of the wind turbine, thus reducing the service life of the wind turbine Limit. With the increase of blade diameter, the frequency of grid flicker will also be caused, which will cause voltage instability and reduce the power quality of grid after the wind turbine is connected to the grid. With the increase of impeller diameter and fan capacity, in recent years, independent variable pitch control technology came into being.Independent pitch control technology not only has the characteristics of centralized pitch control, but also can balance the unbalanced load on variable speed wind turbine, so as to reduce the fatigue load of wind turbine. Therefore, it has been paid attention to in the field of wind power research in the world. There are many research results in this area, but the research on the relationship between independent pitch control strategy and grid flicker is relatively less. The factors causing voltage fluctuation include air density, impeller speed, pitch angle, wind field distribution and power grid condition. This paper analyzes the wind shear and tower shadow effect which cause the vibration of wind turbine, studies the relationship between independent pitch strategy and wind turbine voltage change, proposes a control strategy of independent pitch and designs a controller to control the power of wind turbine during operation The method of voltage variation to make it stable, and then reduce the flicker of power grid, and carry out simulation experiments to verify its effectiveness. The control strategy can reduce the grid flicker at the common point of wind turbine outlet and grid connection, improve the stability of wind turbine grid connection, and improve the overall power quality of the grid.",,,,,Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)Chinese Automation Congress (CAC),"NOV 06-08, 2020NOV 06-08, 2020","IEEE; CAA; IEEE Syst, Man, & Cybernet SocIEEE; CAA; IEEE Syst, Man, & Cybernet Soc","Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2688-092X,2688-0938,978-1-7281-7687-1,,,,,,,,,"Changchun Inst Technol, Sch Energy & Power Engn, Changchun, Peoples R ChinaChangchun Inst Technol, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Changchun, Peoples R ChinaErtan Hydropower Stn YalongRiver Co, Safety Prod Dept Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Ertan Hydropower Stn YalongRiver Co,,,2021-09-09,WOS:000678697007111,,

The design optimization process is composed of three steps; the first step uses a spreadsheet to calculate the platform dimensions; the second step is a frequency domain analysis of the responses in wave conditions; and the final step is a fully coupled simulation time domain analysis to obtain the dynamic responses in combined wind, wave, and current conditions. By having a water column inside the open moonpool, the system's dynamic responses to horizontal and rotating motions are significantly reduced.

Due to the smaller surface roughness, wake recovery is slower in offshore compared to onshore wind farms. Therefore, wake mitigation methods will become relevant for FOWFs as it is for onshore and fixed-bottom offshore wind farms. A common method is to apply yaw misalignment to steer the wake out of the rotor of the downwind turbine. However, it is necessary to investigate possible effects of yaw misalignment on a single turbine before farm-level investigations. This study focuses on the motion response of the platform and damage equivalent loads (DELs) of the mooring line tensions of the 00-Star Wind Floater Semi 10MW floating wind turbine. In order to satisfy environmental variability, the effect of yaw misalignment is investigated at different wind directions and wind/wave misalignments. DELs of three mooring line tensions at the fairleads were calculated using the rainflow algorithm and were reported as relative, normalized with respect to the aligned nacelle operation. Floater motions were analyzed to understand effects of misaligned operation. The results indicate that yawed inflow leads to a complex coupled response of floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs). At slightly above rated wind speed, the yaw misalignment generally increases DELs due to the thrust increase. Conversely, yaw misalignment operation at below rated wind speeds leads to different responses on lines depending on environmental conditions.

This paper investigates the fatigue damage by the blade element momentum theory (BEMT) method and the cost of operation and maintenance by the integrating models. Three prediction models have been proposed for lifetime performance assessment and management of wind turbine blade, i.e. fatigue prediction model (FPM), the reliable stochastic model (SRM) and cost benefit model (CBM). The fatigue model is discussed to reproduce the fatigue damage evolution in composite blades subjected to aerodynamic loadings by cyclical winds. The lifetime probability of fatigue failure of the composite blades is estimated by stochastic deterioration modelling such as gamma process. On the basis of the cost model, an optimised maintenance policy is determined to make optimal maintenance decision for the composite blades. A numerical example is employed to investigate the effectiveness of predicting fatigue damage and estimating the probability of fatigue failure to determine an opportunistic maintenance policy. The results from the numerical study show that the stochastic gamma process together with the fatigue models can provide a useful tool for remaining useful life predictions and optimum maintenance strategies of the composite blades of offshore wind turbines.

A large number of wetlands located in the Azov-Black Sea region attract waterfowl bird species that dominated (79.8% of the total number in spring and 68.7% in autumn). The analysis of the birds stay at the wind farm sites shows that there were registered not more than 25% of the total number of birds recorded in the study area. The main flight directions were north-east in spring (23.7% of all flights) and south-west in autumn (29.6%). Flying birds were registered at different altitudes, but 89.5% of birds flew in the range up to 50 m above the ground in spring and 79.1% - in autumn. The threats of wind farms on birds was evaluated by integrated management assessment tolls. It was found that just few of birds (about of 1 percent) could fly at dangerous altitudes (45-155 m) over the wind farm areas and cross the wind farm barrier.

This is a unique opportunity for two internationally leading Universities to join together to provide an industrially-focussed centre of excellence in this pivotal subject area.The majority of informed and balanced views suggest approximately 180 TWh/year of offshore wind, ~300km of wave farms (19 TWh/year), 1,000 tidal stream turbines (6 TWh/year) and 3 small tidal range schemes (3 TWh/year) are desirable/achievable using David MacKay's UK DECC 2050 Pathways calculator. These together would represent 30% of predicted actual UK electricity demand. This would be a truly enormous renewable energy contribution to the UK electricity supply, given the predicted increase of electricity demand in the transport sector. The inclusion of onshore wind brings this figure closer to 38% of UK electricity by 2050.RenewablesUK predicts Britain has the opportunity to lead the world in developing the emerging marine energy industry with the sector having the potential to employ 10,000 people and generate revenues of nearly £4bn per year by 2020.The large scale development of offshore renewable energy (Wind, Wave and Tidal) represents one of the biggest opportunities for sustainable economic growth in the UK for a generation. The emerging offshore wind sector is however unlike the Oil & Gas industry in that structures are unmanned, fabricated in much larger volumes and the commercial reality is that the sector has to proactively take measures to further reduce CAPEX and OPEX. Support structures need to be structurally optimised and to avail of contemporary and emerging methodologies in structural integrity design and assessment. Current offshore design standards and practices are based on Offshore Oil & Gas experience which relates to unrepresentative target structural reliability, machine and structural loading characteristics and scaling issues particularly with respect to large diameter piled structural systems. To date Universities and the Industry have done a tremendous job to help device developers test and trial different concepts however the challenge now moves to the next stage to ensure these technologies can be manufactured in volume and deployed at the right cost including installation and maintenance over the full design life.This is a proposal to marry together Marine and Offshore Structures expertise with emerging large steel fabrication and welding/joining technologies to ensure graduates from the programme will have the prerequisite knowledge and experience of integrated structural systems to support the developing Offshore and Marine Renewable Energy sector. The Renewable Energy Marine Structures (REMS) Doctoral Centre CDT will embrace the full spectrum of Structural Analysis in the Marine Environment, Materials and Engineering Structural Integrity, Geotechnical Engineering, Foundation Design, Site Investigation, Soil-Structure Interaction, Inspection, Monitoring and NDT through to Environmental Impact and Quantitative Risk and Reliability Analysis so that the UK can lead the world-wide development of a new generation of marine structures and support systems for renewable energy.The Cranfield-Oxford partnership brings together an unrivalled team of internationally leading expertise in the design, manufacture, operation and maintenance of offshore structural systems and together with the industrial partnerships forged as part of this bid promises a truly world-leading centre in Marine Structures for the 21st Century.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/L016303/1,,,,,,,,Cranfield University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15405387,,

The theoretical contribution of this article is that the MSE of the measured model could be estimated with better accuracy, and the advantage of the proposed indicator is that it is more sensitive to damage locations than the traditional MSE method. Numerical studies on a tripod offshore jacket wind turbine reveal that the proposed method could locate the damage positions for jacket-type offshore wind turbines when limited number of lower-order modes is available, even when these modes are spatially incomplete. The performance of the proposed method is also investigated using real measurements from a steel jacket-type offshore wind turbine experiment conducted in a water tank of Ocean University of China. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms the traditional MSE method, and damages in jacket-type offshore wind turbines could be properly located utilising the first two measured modes excited by environmental loadings, such as waves, currents, or the vibration of the wind turbine.

Therefore, it is important to accurately estimate the extreme design loads. This paper deals with a recently proposed method for obtaining short-term extreme values for the dynamic responses of offshore fixed wind turbines. The 5MW NREL wind turbine is mounted on a jacket structure (92m high) at a water depth of 70m at a northern offshore site in the North Sea. The hub height is 67m above tower base or top of the jacket, i.e. 89m above mean water level. The turbine response is numerically obtained by using the aerodynamic software HAWC2 and the hydrodynamic software USFOS. Two critical responses are discussed, the base shear force and the bending moment at the bottom of the jacket. The extreme structural responses are considered for wave-induced and wind-induced loads for a 100year return-period harsh metocean condition with a 14.0m significant wave height, a 16s peak spectral period, a 50ms (-1) (10min average) wind speed (at the hub) and a turbulence intensity of 0.1 for a parked wind turbine. After performing the 10min nonlinear dynamic simulations, a recently proposed extrapolation method is used for obtaining the extreme values of those responses over a period of 3h. The sensitivity of the extremes to sample size is also studied. The extreme value statistics are estimated from the empirical mean upcrossing rates. This method together with other frequently used methods (i.e. the Weibull tail method and the global maxima method) is compared with the 3h extreme values obtained directly from the time-domain simulations.

It is assumed the response with a return period of T years occurs during a sea-state with a shorter or equal return period. This provides good extreme response estimates for structures with a response behaviour monotonically increasing with the severity of the sea-state. For an offshore wind turbine, the power production stops at a certain wind speed to reduce wear, changing the dynamics of the system dramatically, from wind to wave load dominated. Also, there is a non-negligible probability for the turbine being unable to operate although the wind speeds would suggest so, due to e.g. grid- or mechanical failure. Therefore, the original contour-line method for extreme response estimation is not applicable without some modifications to account for changing dynamics. In the present work, it is suggested to treat the operational and non-operational conditions as two sub-populations and estimate the T-year response in each population by a standard contour-line method.

Postlarvae were exposed to variations of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) generated by the flow speed of a water pump and variations of combined flow speed and vertical motions of an actuator-driven cylinder array. The position and swimming activity of the postlarvae were recorded using a video camera. Images of postlarvae were analyzed at 3 depths of the water column (upper half, bottom half, and floor of the experimental chamber). During trials varying flow speed alone, both TKE levels (<0.009 cm(2) s(-2)) and the number of postlarvae in the upper half of the water column were low, suggesting that the TKE levels were below their stimulation threshold. In contrast, swimming activity increased substantially during trials incorporating additional TKE generated by the actuator. TKE levels varied between 1.1 and 3.5 cm(2) s(-2), and postlarvae vertical position reflected increases and decreases in TKE. A statistically significant (p < 0.05) higher percentage of postlarvae in the upper half of the water column coincided with high TKE values. Increases in postlarval response relative to increases in TKE diminished after reaching TKE values of 2.5 cm(2) s(-2), suggesting a dose-limited behavioral response. This trend was supported by a significant horizontally asymptotic regression of change in postlarval response against percent change in TKE relative to the previous time step. The results suggest turbulence involvement during flood-tidal migration behavior of this species. During most of the flood tide, TKE levels would be sufficiently high to stimulate postlarvae to swim in the water column and remain there while moving in the direction of settlement habitats.

Minor changes of support conditions may lead to the shift of natural frequencies, and this could be disastrous if resonance happens. To monitor the support conditions and thus to enhance the safety of offshore wind turbines, a model updating method is developed in this study. A hybrid sensing system was fabricated and set up in the laboratory to investigate the long-term dynamic behaviour of the offshore wind turbine system with monopile foundation in sandy deposits. A finite element model was constructed to simulate structural behaviours of the offshore wind turbine system. Distributed nonlinear springs and a roller boundary condition are used to model the soil-structure interaction properties. The finite element model and the test results were used to analyse the variation of the support condition of the monopile, through an finite element model updating process using estimation of distribution algorithms. The results show that the fundamental frequency of the test model increases after a period under cyclic loading, which is attributed to the compaction of the surrounding sand instead of local damage of the structure. The hybrid sensing system is reliable to detect both the acceleration and strain responses of the offshore wind turbine model and can be potentially applied to the remote monitoring of real offshore wind turbines. The estimation of distribution algorithm-based model updating technique is demonstrated to be successful for the support condition monitoring of the offshore wind turbine system, which is potentially useful for other model updating and condition monitoring applications.",,,,,,,,,22,1,0,0,0,0,23,,,1475-9217,1741-3168,,,,,,,,,,"Tianjin Univ, Key Lab Earthquake Engn Simulat & Seism Resilienc, China Earthquake Adm, Tianjin, Peoples R ChinaUniv Surrey, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, EnglandKings Coll London, Sch Biomed Engn & Imaging Sci, London, England",,,,2020-09-01,WOS:000560785100004,,

The characteristics of these hazards have an important effect on the design of offshore structures and determine the suitability of simplifying assumptions for modeling, such as whether the maxima can be reasonably modeled as occurring simultaneously during the hurricane and whether the N-year values of the hazards can be modeled separately and combined. Such assumptions are common in practice. Assessing the implications of these assumptions to better inform hazard modeling along the U.S. Atlantic coast is the central objective of this paper. To this end, the characteristics of wind speeds, waves, and storm surge during hurricanes are evaluated for ten areas where development of offshore wind is proposed. The assumptions are evaluated for a model of an offshore wind turbine using time histories of hazards during intense hurricanes and using so-called environmental contours constructed through a novel implementation of the Inverse First Order Reliability Method. The results of this study show that these assumptions are reasonably accurate, especially for wind and wave in shallow waters and for wind and surge in deep waters. Hazard ratios are proposed as a suitable representation of the characteristics of hazard maxima. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, the risk analysis of collision between maintenance ship vessels and offshore wind turbines has received very little attention. In this paper, we propose a methodology to evaluate and prioritise the collision risks associated with various kinds of ships used for carrying out maintenance tasks on different subassemblies of wind turbines in an offshore wind farm. It is also studied how the risks of ship collision with wind turbines are distributed between two main types of maintenance tasks, namely corrective and preventative. The proposed model is tested on an offshore wind turbine with seventeen components requiring five kinds of ships to perform the maintenance tasks. Our results indicate that collision risks are mostly associated with maintenance of few components of the wind turbine and in particular, those undergoing a corrective maintenance (replacement).

These projects are also focused on fixed offshore wind turbines at depths of less than 50 m. The design conservatism observed is present to avoid many changes to the proven technology on land-based wind turbines and offshore fixed foundations, to assure technical feasibility and economic viability in the short term. However, exportation of onshore technology directly to the offshore environment may not be entirely advantageous. There are opportunities in new designs or configurations, which can potentially lower cost of energy in a less restrictive offshore environment. This paper aims to review the current offshore wind technology and discusses comprehensively some of the factors and opportunities in selecting a downwind configuration for offshore wind turbines. In addition, current industry, research and developmental trends for downwind offshore wind turbines are described.

The simulation results indicate that the receptor and conductor area close to the receptor area are more likely to get struck by lightning, and the LSP increases under the influence of salt fog. The validity of the model is verified by experiments. Furthermore, the receptor can protect the blade from lightning strikes effectively when the lateral distance between the rod electrode and receptor is short. The influence of salt fog on LSP is more obvious if salt fog is close to the receptor or if the scope of salt fog area increases.

The construction of wind-turbine foundations (WTFs) introduces new artificial structures into coastal ecosystems, influencing the surrounding macrobenthos. Small-scale effects on macrobenthic assemblages around a high-rise cap pile WTF in Pinghai Bay, China, were investigated in November 2017 and May 2018, along SW and SE gradients. The macrobenthic abundance increased from 220 +/- 92 individuals (ind) m(-2) at 200 m to 547 +/- 103 ind m(-2) at 25 m from the foundation, and the species number increased from 8 +/- 3 at 200 m to 16 +/- 6 per sample at 25 m from the foundation, whereas the biomass decreased from 17.2 +/- 2 g m(-2) at 200 m to 3.1 +/- 1.4 g m(-2) at 25 m from the foundation. The macrobenthic abundance increased by 94.75% compared with that before the WTF construction. Abundance significantly increased from 179 +/- 115 to 463 +/- 255 ind m(-2) for Annelida, from 62 +/- 56 to 99 +/- 77 ind m(-2) for Arthropoda, and from 4 +/- 3 to 22 +/- 25 ind m(-2) for Echinodermata. However, the abundance of Mollusca decreased from 65 +/- 100 to 14 +/- 22 ind m(-2). Thus, it is likely that most macrobenthos were able to recover quickly after the deployment of WTF, whereas more time might be needed for Mollusca to recover.

This paper presents a new concept to integrate compressed air energy storage (CAES) in floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) structures. The FOWT support structures will serve a dual purpose: to provide the necessary buoyancy to maintain the entire wind turbine afloat and stable under different met-ocean conditions and to act as a pressure vessel for compressed air energy storage on site. The proposed concept involves a hydro-pneumatic accumulator installed on the seabed to store pressurized deep sea water that is pneumatically connected to the floating support structure by means of an umbilical conduit. The present study investigates the technical feasibility of this concept when integrated in tension leg platforms (TLPs). The focus is on the impact of the additional floating platform weight resulting from the CAES on the dynamic response characteristics and loads when exposed to irregular waves. A simplified model for sizing the TLP hull for different energy storage capacities is initially presented. This is then used to evaluate the dynamic response of nine different TLP geometries when supporting the NREL' 5MW baseline wind turbine model. Numerical simulations are carried out using the marine engineering software tool ANSYS Aqwae. The work provides an insight on how TLP structures supporting wind turbines may be optimised to facilitate the integration of the proposed CAES concept. It is shown that it is technically feasible to integrate CAES capacities on the order of Megawatt Hours within TLP structures without compromising the stability of the floating system; although this would involve a substantial increase in the total structure weight.,,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,,,978-0-7918-5778-6,,,,,,,,,"Univ Malta, Dept Mech Engn, Msida, MaltaUniv Malta, Inst Sustainable Energy, Marsaxlokk, Malta",,,,2017-12-22,WOS:000417228200049,,

Operational risks (either risk of system failures or environmental risks) may cause catastrophic damages to personnel or infrastructure and result in substantial costs in terms of lost production and emergency maintenance operations. Selection of a suitable strategy for mitigation of the risks associated with offshore renewable energy projects is a very complex and critical task. The aim of this paper is to propose a fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) approach, based on Chang's extent analysis, in order to select the most appropriate risk mitigation strategy for offshore wind farms. Our proposed model consists of four possible alternatives (variation of offshore site layout, improvement of maintenance services, upgrading the monitoring systems, and modification in design of wind turbines) among which the decision maker has to select the best strategy according to four comparison criteria: safety, added value, cost and feasibility. The model is then applied to determine a suitable risk mitigation strategy for an offshore wind farm consisting of 30 wind turbines of 2 MW.

In addition to satisfying strength requirements, it is typical and vital to meet fatigue criteria for a service life of 25 years or more. Wmd spectra characteristics considered in analysis can penalize fatigue designs, leading to unnecessary costs. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC, 2009) recommends the use of site-specific wind data (spectrum, turbulence intensity, etc.) in design of FOWTs, but for offshore sites it is often the case that such data is unavailable and land-based data are used as surrogates in design. For such scenarios, it is worth investigating whether such alternative approach is suitable and accurate, and understanding the consequence of the selection of wind spectral characteristics on fatigue design. This paper addresses the impact of the subsequent selection on fatigue responses of towerbase and mooring system in a FOWT, as a sequel to the paper by Udoh and Zou (2018) which focused on impacts on strength design. The 5 MW semi-submersible FOWT platform with six mooring lines implemented in the preceding study is applied in analysis. Results indicate significant variations in resulting fatigue life with considered wind parameters. Thus, it is critical to apply proper wind spectra characteristics for analysis and design of FOWTs to avoid unnecessary conservatism and costs. Based on the findings of this study, more explicit guidance on the application of turbulence intensities for IEC-recommended models in offshore sites could lead to more accurate load estimates in design of FOWTs.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,2093-6702,2093-677X,,,,,,,,,,"Atkins, Houston Offshore Engn, 17220 Katy Freeway,Suite 200, Houston, TX 77094 USA",Atkins,,,2019-07-02,WOS:000472160700005,,

Previous studies have shown that the zoea-1 larvae of some crab species use selective tidal-stream transport (STST) to migrate from estuaries to coastal areas. The STST behavior of newly hatched larvae is characterized by upward vertical migration during ebb tide followed by a descent toward the bottom during flood. The objectives of the study were (1) to determine if newly hatched zoeae of U. pugilator and C. sapidus possess endogenous tidal rhythms in vertical migration that could underlie STST, (2) to determine if the rhythms persist in the absence of estuarine chemical cues, and (3) to characterize the photoresponses of zoeae to assess the impact of light on swimming behavior and vertical distribution. Ovigerous crabs with late-stage embryos were collected from June to August 2002 and maintained under constant laboratory conditions. Following hatching, swimming activity of zoeae was monitored in darkness for 72 h. U. pugilator zoeae displayed a circatidal rhythm in swimming with peaks in activity occurring near the expected times of ebb currents in the field. Conversely, C. sapidus zoeae exhibited no clear rhythmic migration patterns. When placed in a light field that simulated the underwater angular light distribution, C. sapidus larvae displayed a weak positive phototaxis at the highest light levels tested, while U. pugilator zoeae were unresponsive. Swimming behaviors and photoresponses of both species were not significantly influenced by the presence of chemical cues associated with offshore or estuarine water. These results are consistent with predictions based on species-specific differences in spawning and the proximity of hatching areas to the mouths of estuaries. U. pugilator larvae are released within estuaries near the adult habitat. Thus, ebb-phased STST behavior by zoeae is adaptive since it enhances export. Selective pressures for a tidal migration in C. sapidus larvae are likely weaker than for U. pugilator since ovigerous females migrate seaward prior to spawning and hatching occurs near inlets and in coastal waters.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,27,1,35,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA",,,,2007-07-01,WOS:000247308000003,,

The time-history of the wind speed is generated by using the Weibull distribution based on the offshore wind parameters available. The maximum stress caused by the aerodynamic loads due to wind is then calculated through the finite element analyses. The fatigue cycle during the certain time period is estimated by fast Fourier transform for the load spectrum, which converts the time-stress spectrum to stress cycles. The fatigue damage and remaining service life of wind turbine composite blades are estimated by the Goodman diagram and S-N curve for stress cycles during the service time. Finally, the remaining service life is predicted by utilising the Miner's law for linear fatigue damage accumulation.

Research suggests that the combined operation of tidal stream and range power schemes can exceed 12% of the UK's energy demand from a sustainable, green energy source. In comparison with other renewable resources this comes with complete predictability which means that tidal can play a vital role in meeting the nation's energy needs. At the time of writing this proposal, pilot projects for tidal stream and range based energy generation are in the advanced stages of planning and development within the UK. The first tidal stream turbines installed within a pilot array in the Pentland Firth off of Scotland have just started to generate power (7 Dec 2016), with the next phase (project Stroma) confirmed on 15 Dec 2016. For tidal range, the UK Government's Hendry review, released on the 10th of Feb 2017, recommended that tidal lagoons (tidal range structures) can play an important role in the UK's energy mix. This provides a roadmap towards the development of the Swansea Bay lagoon, the first tidal range energy structure of this type worldwide where construction could commence in 2018, with much larger projects to follow.We are thus at a crucial stage in the development of a new tidal-based renewable energy sector where the UK currently leads the world. This project seeks to build on this strong position by providing timely research on the ecological impacts of new, larger tidal developments in a manner that supports decision making by stakeholders, including coastal engineers, financiers, policy-makers and primarily those concerned with environmental impacts. This project builds upon a strong foundation of recent work at Imperial College London that has provided the preliminary demonstration of computational methods for the representation of turbine arrays and tidal range structures within multi-scale models, as well as the optimisation of array designs and tidal plant operations to maximise power or profit, while minimising environmental impacts. Importantly this optimisation is fully coupled to the underlying tidal dynamics, so that changes to the array design and lagoon operation can feed back to the resource and vice-versa.A major hurdle for large tidal energy projects is the uncertainty associated with environmental processes such as sedimentation, water quality and fish migration. In particular, fish mortality caused by encounters with turbines has consistently been a controversial issue that developers and environmental agencies alike have had to consider and mitigate. This project seeks to develop a new methodology that considers fish migration routes in estuarine and coastal areas. It will combine state-of-the-art regional scale ocean models developed at Imperial College with routing and optimisation algorithms developed with the support of experts in fisheries and aquaculture from CEFAS.Ultimately the objective is to apply the developed tools to several real-world sites under consideration: tidal lagoons in the Bristol Channel and tidal stream arrays in the Pentland Firth. These case studies offer the opportunity to provide immediate impact on the design of the first pilot schemes, and a route to support the successful development of larger projects using a more comprehensive ecological impact assessment. This project will therefore provide high impact outcomes to strengthen the UK's leading (academic and commercial) position within the international energy community.The applicant and the wider Imperial group (as well as the academic community in general) will benefit from new ecosystem/fisheries modelling capabilities within the open source Thetis framework. CEFAS will benefit from exposure to, and training on, state-of-the-art numerical modelling tools which have the flexibility to simulate both tidal range and tidal stream coastal infrastructure developments.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/R006733/1,,,,,,,,Imperial College London,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15297148,,

It is proved that the complete dynamic response of the structure can only be captured with coupled models. In this paper a fully-coupled model for Offshore Wind Turbines with jacket support is presented. The computational model allows to obtain an accurate response of the whole structure and the dynamic interaction between all the elements. It also allows to reproduce particular effects such as the aerodynamic damping without the need for artificial damping ratios which would be needed in decoupled models. Typical environmental offshore conditions are integrated in the model and the response of the structure is obtained by means of a non-linear time integration algorithm in order to include the effect of the continuous rotation of the blades. A cost-efficient approach for the determination of fatigue-damage in the joints of the jackets is proposed. It is based on short-time simulations which allow to accurately estimate the long-term damage in general. The estimation shows a good agreement when compared to the damage values obtained by performing the whole time-interval simulation.,,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ A Coruna, Civil Engn Sch, Grp Numer Methods Engn, Campus Elvina, La Coruna 15071, Spain",,,,2020-05-18,WOS:000530233700009,,

The open net steel cage is octagonal in shape with a partially porous wave fence at its top end to attenuate wave energy for a calm fish farming environment as well as to keep predators out. The deep draught spar is made from concrete for its bottom half and from steel for its top half. The spar carries a control unit and a 1 MW wind turbine that provides the required power to operate the offshore salmon fish farm. The COSPAR fish cage has four catenary chains as mooring lines attached to mid length of the spar (outside the fish cage) so as to mitigate tension force in the mooring lines and to reduce the benthic footprint. ANSYS Design Modeler and Aqwa are used to perform the hydrodynamic response analysis of free-floating condition of COSPAR in the frequency domain and coupled analysis involving COSPAR and the mooring lines in the frequency domain and time domain. Environmental conditions, representing 5-year, 20-year and 50-year wave return periods with a constant current flow at an exposed fish farming site in Storm Bay of Tasmania, Australia, are adopted for the analyses. A comparison study is made against having a floating fish cage only (i.e. without the bottom half concrete of the spar) with four catenary chains attached to side vertical columns of the cage so that the fish cage behaves like a semi-submersible cage. Based on the comparison study, the COSPAR fish cage shows enhanced hydrodynamic responses in the following respects: (1) more stable motion responses in heave and pitch against wave and current forces, (2) less susceptible to the viscous damping when it is assumed by a linearized drag force of Morison elements in the frequency domain and (3) reduction of tension forces in the mooring lines. Interestingly, the pitch motion response of COSPAR fish cage in the frequency domain is in close agreement with the time domain result due to its greater pitching stiffness that reduces nonlinear effects from viscous drag and mooring interaction.",,,,,,,,,26,1,0,0,5,0,27,,,0219-4554,1793-6764,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Queensland, Sch Civil Engn, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",,,,2020-10-19,WOS:000574947700007,,

The vast majority of wind power is generated from onshore wind farms. Their growth is however limited by the lack of inexpensive land near major population centers and the visual pollution caused by large wind turbines.Wind energy generated from offshore wind farms is the next frontier. Large sea areas with stronger and steadier winds are available for wind farm development and 5MW wind turbine towers located 20 miles from the coastline are invisible. Current offshore wind turbines are supported by monopoles driven into the seafloor at coastal sites a few miles from shore and in water depths of 10-15m. The primary impediment to their growth is visual pollution and the prohibitive cost of seafloor mounted monopoles in larger water depths.This paper presents a fully coupled dynamic analysis of floating wind turbines that enables a parametric design study of floating wind turbine concepts and mooring systems. Pareto optimal designs are presented that possess a favorable combination of nacelle acceleration, mooring system tension and displacement of the floating structure supporting a five megawatt wind turbine. All concepts are selected so that they float stably while in tow to the offshore wind farm site and prior to their connection to the mooring system. A fully coupled dynamic analysis is carried out of the wind turbine, floater and mooring system in wind and a sea state based on standard computer programs used by the offshore and wind industries. The results of the parametric study are designs that show Pareto fronts for mean square acceleration of the turbine versus key cost drivers for the offshore structure that include the weight of the floating structure and the static plus dynamic mooring line tension.Pareto optimal structures are generally either a narrow deep drafted spar, or a shallow drafted barge ballasted with concrete.The mooring systems include both tension leg and catenary mooring systems. In some of the designs, the RMS acceleration of the wind turbine nacelle can be as low as 0.03 g in a sea state with a significant wave height of ten meters and water depths of up to 200 meters. These structures meet design requirements while possessing a favorable combination of nacelle acceleration, total mooring system tension and weight of the floating structure.

The situation in offshore wind farms may be worse due to the wet, salty and corrosive air in offshore environments. Due to the limitations of small hull and deck spaces, there is difficulty to apply the proven motion stabilization techniques to wind farm crew transfer vessels. Consequently, the present crew transfer vessels have limited capability in providing safe transfer between the vessel and wind turbines, particularly in rough sea waves. To tackle this issue, a new motion stabilization technique is studied in this paper by using both numerical analysis and experimental testing approaches. Through investigating the vessel's motions under different wave conditions before and after applying the proposed technique, it is found that the heave, roil and pitch motions of the vessel, especially in its resonant frequency regions, have been successfully constrained after applying the proposed stabilizing technique. Moreover, the amount of motion reduction can be further improved through optimizing the size of stabilizers and their underwater distance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

For this purpose, tidal turbine operation is modelled within coastal models, as enhanced bottom friction, or momentum sinks. In Delft3D-FLOW, a state-of-the-art coastal model, turbine operation is usually represented via momentum losses, using the Porous Plate tool. However, the Porous Plate tool presents significant limitations to accurately represent energy extraction and geometry of tidal turbines. Recently, a new tool (Actuator Disc) based on the Momentum Actuator Disc Theory (MADT) was developed in Delft3D-FLOW, overcoming the aforementioned limitations and showing excellent results against laboratory data. The aim of this work is to compare the behaviour of the Actuator Disc and Porous Plate on the far-field hydrodynamics. Overall, significant differences were found, with the Porous Plate significantly underestimating the impact on instantaneous and residual flow velocities and turbulence conditions, when the turbine operates at its rated power. Consequently, MADT appears as the best alternative to investigate the far-field hydrodynamic impacts of tidal turbine operation and previous research based on the Porous Plate tool should be revisited.

Some populations are of high conservation concern, but they also cause agricultural damage, are quarry for hunters, and may be particularly sensitive to infrastructure developments. In Bulgarian Dobrudzha, large wintering populations of greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons and red-breasted geese Branta ruficollis feed in agricultural land, and cause management dilemmas. We developed linear models to investigate fine- and meso-scale foraging habitat selection of geese foraging on winter wheat in the area, and used these models to make suggestions for zoning landscape use in order to reduce conflict and conserve geese. Habitat selection was scale-dependent. Geese selected fields that were near to major roosts and had low proximity to roads and tree-lines, which may be a proxy for hunting disturbance. We found some evidence for selection of wheat fields with high nutritional quality. Within fields, geese strongly avoided features which cause landscape 'clutter': power-lines, tree-lines and wind-turbines, but primarily over distances of less than a few hundred metres. Optimal management might involve encouraging goose populations to feed in areas close to roosts, by means of agri-environmental measures and creation of hunting-free refuges. This would allow efficient use of agri-environment funds, might reduce conflict with farmers, and would mean that infrastructure development-notably wind farms-could be sited at greater distance from roosts with relatively minor impact on foraging habitat availability.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,5,0,10,,,0960-3115,1572-9710,,,,,,,,,,"Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, Slimbridge GL2 7BT, Glos, EnglandBulgarian Soc Protect Birds, POB 50, Sofia 1111, BulgariaRSPB Ctr Conservat Sci, RSPB, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, EnglandSoftlab, Julio A Roca 695,Piso 1, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Wildfowl & Wetlands TrustBulgarian Soc Protect BirdsSoftlab,,,2018-01-11,WOS:000419149800009,,

For this purpose, the consequences of different reception limit values for the new Dutch noise legislation have been studied, both in terms of effects on the population and regarding sustainable energy policy targets. On the basis of a nation-wide noise map containing all wind turbines in The Netherlands, it is calculated that 3 of the inhabitants of The Netherlands are currently exposed to noise from wind turbines above 28 dB(A) at the faade. Newly established dose-response relationships indicate that about 1500 of these inhabitants are likely to be severely annoyed inside their dwellings.

However, in order to provide even a fraction of the estimated future energy needs, a large-scale deployment of wind turbines (several million) is required. The consequent environmental impacts, and the inherent reliability of such a large-scale usage of intermittent wind power would have to be carefully assessed, in addition to the need to lower the high current unit wind power costs. Our previous study (Wang and Prinn 2010 Atmos. Chem. Phys. 10 2053) using a three-dimensional climate model suggested that a large deployment of wind turbines over land to meet about 10% of predicted world energy needs in 2100 could lead to a significant temperature increase in the lower atmosphere over the installed regions. A global-scale perturbation to the general circulation patterns as well as to the cloud and precipitation distribution was also predicted. In the later study reported here, we conducted a set of six additional model simulations using an improved climate model to further address the potential environmental and intermittency issues of large-scale deployment of offshore wind turbines for differing installation areas and spatial densities. In contrast to the previous land installation results, the offshore wind turbine installations are found to cause a surface cooling over the installed offshore regions. This cooling is due principally to the enhanced latent heat flux from the sea surface to lower atmosphere, driven by an increase in turbulent mixing caused by the wind turbines which was not entirely offset by the concurrent reduction of mean wind kinetic energy. We found that the perturbation of the large-scale deployment of offshore wind turbines to the global climate is relatively small compared to the case of land-based installations. However, the intermittency caused by the significant seasonal wind variations over several major offshore sites is substantial, and demands further options to ensure the reliability of large-scale offshore wind power. The method that we used to simulate the offshore wind turbine effect on the lower atmosphere involved simply increasing the ocean surface drag coefficient. While this method is consistent with several detailed fine-scale simulations of wind turbines, it still needs further study to ensure its validity. New field observations of actual wind turbine arrays are definitely required to provide ultimate validation of the model predictions presented here.",,,,,,,,,29,1,0,0,4,0,33,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"MIT, Ctr Global Change Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USAMIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,,2011-04-01,WOS:000295326800028,,

Power for these sites is usually provided by diesel generator sets although, with high winds or solar radiation levels, wind-turbines and solar arrays could prove an ideal alternative. This is especially true for Antarctica.The Australian Antarctic Division currently ships approximately 750,000 litres of diesel fuel annually to each of three continental stations located on the coastline of East Antarctica. These operations are expensive and savings could be expected from the introduction of a renewable energy generation capability. These stations experience strong winds with gusts recorded at up to 81 m/s, together with temperatures often plunging below -30 degrees C in winter. This, while providing adequate meteorological conditions for power generation by wind-turbines, also imposes harsh design criteria. Solar also remains an extremely promising alternative during the summer, but is not viable for the winter.As part of a project investigating 'Alternative Energy for Antarctic Stations', analysis of meteorological data has given wind energy capacity factors estimates of up to 0.7, and summer solar energy capacity factors estimates of up to 0.3. These, combined with station load measurements, have been used to determine the optimal sizing of the number and ratio of wind/solar to storage devices.

The concept is developed to address the problem of waiting for a suitable weather window which is commonly faced by the existing installation methods that uses a typical jack-up platform. In the methodology, a floating vessel along with a floatable subsea structure fitted with a hull on the top, hereafter named SSIP (subsea structure for installing a pile), is proposed first to install a monopile. Then the same structure is used to carry an FIUS (fully integrated upper structure) of an offshore wind turbine, which is characterized by a telescopic tower, and install it over the monopile by using an FOP (float-over-pulling) arrangement. Here, the installation methodologies are first briefly described along with the critical load cases associated with them. These load cases are then numerically studied for a significant wave height (H-S) of 2.5 m, and the results are summarized. For installing a fully integrated offshore wind turbine upper structure on a monopile foundation by the FOP method, two installation schemes are presented, and their dynamic characteristics are compared. It is shown that the proposed methodologies have potential to provide installation solutions which can be environmentally more robust compared to the existing method for installing an offshore wind turbine.

Wind turbine blades are under significant gravitational, inertial, and aerodynamic loads, which cause their fatigue and degradation during the wind turbine operational life. A fatigue problem is often present at the blade root because of the considerable bending moments applied to this zone. Interest in the integration of control with fatigue load minimization has increased in recent years. This paper investigates the fatigue assessment using a rainflow counting algorithm and the blade root moment information coming from the sensor available in a high-fidelity simulator of a utility-scale wind turbine. Then, the integration of the fatigue-based system health management module with control is proposed. This provides a mechanism for the wind turbine to operate safely and optimize the trade-off between components' life and energy production. In particular, this paper explores the integration of model predictive control with the fatigue-based prognosis approach to minimize the damage of wind turbine components (the blades). A control-oriented model of the fatigue based on the rainflow counting algorithm is proposed to obtain online information of the blades' accumulated damage that can be integrated with model predictive control.

Wind turbine failures are equivalent to crucial financial losses. Therefore, creating and applying strategies that improve the reliability of their components is important for a successful implementation of such systems. Structural health monitoring (SHM) addresses these problems through the monitoring of parameters indicative of the state of the structure examined. Condition monitoring (CM), on the other hand, can be seen as a specialized area of the SHM community that aims at damage detection of, particularly, rotating machinery. The paper is divided into two parts: in the first part, advanced signal processing and machine learning methods are discussed for SHM and CM on wind turbine gearbox and blade damage detection examples. In the second part, an initial exploration of supervisor control and data acquisition systems data of an offshore wind farm is presented, and data-driven approaches are proposed for detecting abnormal behaviour of wind turbines. It is shown that the advanced signal processing methods discussed are effective and that it is important to adopt these SHM strategies in the wind energy sector.",,,,,,,,,54,2,0,0,1,0,55,,,1364-503X,1471-2962,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sheffield, Dept Mech Engn, Dynam Res Grp, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, EnglandNew Renewables, Vattenfall Res & Dev, Edinburgh EH8 8AE, Midlothian, Scotland",New Renewables,,,2015-02-25,WOS:000347845700004,25583864,

Generally, the proposed excitations and corresponding vibration sources have a direct relationship with the structural operational safety of the offshore wind turbine and can be reflected by the vibration responses. Nevertheless, existing studies in this area mainly focus on understanding the effect of environmental excitations on the structural vibrations of offshore wind turbines and identifying the dynamic parameters. The research on the identification of the vibration sources and the corresponding energy distribution of offshore wind turbine structures based on the observation data have not yet been carried out. Therefore, using the measured vibration responses of an offshore wind turbine prototype, an identification technology based on optimized spectral kurtosis (OSK) and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) methods, which is capable of determining both the structural vibration sources and the corresponding energy distribution was presented for the first time. It can be demonstrated that the structural vibration sources changed from environmental excitations to forced harmonic loads when the rotating speed and power of the turbine increased. At the same time, the main vibration energy underwent a transformation from random vibration energy to harmonic vibration energy with a change in the operational factors.

The effects of scour on the short-term and long-term responses of the NREL 5-MW wind turbine under operational conditions have been analyzed by using a finite element beam model with Winkler springs to model soil-structure interaction. It was found that due to scour, the modal properties of the wind turbine do not change significantly. However, the maximum bending moment in the monopile increases, leading to a significant reduction in fatigue life. Backfilling the scour hole can recover the fatigue life, depending mostly on the depth after backfilling.

The widespread availability of wind power has fueled substantial interest in this renewable energy source as one of the needed technologies. For very large-scale utilization of this resource, there are however potential environmental impacts, and also problems arising from its inherent intermittency, in addition to the present need to lower unit costs. To explore some of these issues, we use a three-dimensional climate model to simulate the potential climate effects associated with installation of wind-powered generators over vast areas of land or coastal ocean. Using wind turbines to meet 10% or more of global energy demand in 2100, could cause surface warming exceeding 1 degrees C over land installations. In contrast, surface cooling exceeding 1 degrees C is computed over ocean installations, but the validity of simulating the impacts of wind turbines by simply increasing the ocean surface drag needs further study. Significant warming or cooling remote from both the land and ocean installations, and alterations of the global distributions of rainfall and clouds also occur. These results are influenced by the competing effects of increases in roughness and decreases in wind speed on near-surface turbulent heat fluxes, the differing nature of land and ocean surface friction, and the dimensions of the installations parallel and perpendicular to the prevailing winds. These results are also dependent on the accuracy of the model used, and the realism of the methods applied to simulate wind turbines. Additional theory and new field observations will be required for their ultimate validation. Intermittency of wind power on daily, monthly and longer time scales as computed in these simulations and inferred from meteorological observations, poses a demand for one or more options to ensure reliability, including backup generation capacity, very long distance power transmission lines, and onsite energy storage, each with specific economic and/or technological challenges.",,,,,,,,,129,14,0,0,17,0,162,,,1680-7316,1680-7324,,,,,,,,,,"MIT, Ctr Global Change Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USAMIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000274851500036,,

A typical 2.0 MW turbine with three 50 m blades has approximately 20 tonnes of FRP material and an 8 MW turbine has approximately 80 tonnes of FRP material (1 MW approximate to 10 tonnes of FRP). Calculations show that 4.2 million tonnes will need to be managed globally by 2035 and 16.3 million tonnes by 2055 if wind turbine construction continues at current levels and with current technology. Three major categories of end-of-life (EOL) options are possible - disposal, recovery and reuse.

Large-sized FRP pieces that can be salvaged from the turbine blades and potentially useful in infrastructure projects where harsh environmental conditions (water and high humidity) exist.

First, the proposed method calculates the statistical population maximum likelihood estimation of the objective probability degradation characteristics and cycling patterns observed for historical precursors. Then, the method uses the Markov chain Monte Carlo method to generate hypothetical probability estimations of the objective features and synthesizes these probability density functions to build multivariate copula probability framework approximations of the features.

This research shows the multivariate probability pattern of the integrity of an offshore structure under multielement coupling load conditions.

Seismic liquefaction in marine engineering can have huge financial repercussions as well as a devastating effect on the marine environment, which merits our great attention. As the effects of seawater and the gas component in the seabed layers are not negligible, the seabed soil layers are more prone to liquefaction than onshore soil layers, and the liquefied area may be larger than when liquefaction occurs on land.

These issues have begun to stimulate research and development in the wide control community particularly for these installations that need a high degree of sustainability. Note that this topic represents a key point mainly for offshore wind turbines with very large rotors, since they are characterised by challenging modelling and control problems, as well as expensive and safety critical maintenance works. In this case, a clear conflict exists between ensuring a high degree of availability and reducing maintenance times, which affect the final energy cost. On the other hand, wind turbines have highly nonlinear dynamics, with a stochastic and uncontrollable driving force as input in the form of wind speed, thus representing an interesting challenge also from the modelling point of view. Suitable control methods can provide a sustainable optimisation of the energy conversion efficiency over wider than normally expected working conditions. Moreover, a proper mathematical description of the wind turbine system should be able to capture the complete behaviour of the process under monitoring, thus providing an important impact on the control design itself. In this way, the control scheme could guarantee prescribed performance, whilst also giving a degree of tolerance to possible deviation of characteristic properties or system parameters from standard conditions, if properly included in the wind turbine model itself.

For example, large-size wind-farm financing packages -and in the case of five turbines this can swiftly exceed 20 million euroscan be handled as a financing consortium consisting of the cooperative bank and the central bank. Alongside long-term loan financing and reliance on the relevant government subsidies, the range of services also includes variable financing forms, and this extends to interest and exchange-rate hedges.

Current operation and maintenance (O&M) practices typically make use of corrective type maintenance as the basic approach, implying high costs for repair and replacement activities as well as large revenue losses, mainly in the case of offshore wind farms. The recent development and evolution of condition monitoring techniques, as well as the fact that an increasing number of installed turbines are equipped with online monitoring systems, offers a large amount of information on the blades structural health to the decision maker. Further, inspections of the blades are often performed in connection with service. In light of the obtained information, a preventive type of maintenance becomes feasible, with the potential of predicting the blades remaining life to support O&M decisions for avoiding major failure events. The present paper presents a fracture mechanics based model for estimating the remaining life of a wind turbine blade, focusing on the crack propagation in the blades adhesive joints.

Many current industry tools for modelling these effects are limited to empirically derived predictions. A technique is described for coupling transient wind modelling with an aero-elastic simulation to dynamically model both turbine operation and wake structures. The important feature of this approach is a turbine model in a flow simulation, which actively responds to transient wind events through the inclusion of controller actions such as blade pitching and regulation of generator torque. The coupled nature of the aero-elastic/flow simulation also allows recording of load and control data, which permits the analysis of turbine interaction in multiple turbine systems. An aero-elastic turbine simulation code and a large eddy simulation (LES) solver using an actuator disc model were adapted for this work. Coupling of the codes was implemented with the use of a software framework to transfer data between simulations in a synchronous manner. A computationally efficient simulation was developed with the ability to model turbines exhibiting standard baseline control operating in an offshore environment. Single and multiple wind turbine instances were modelled in a transient flow domain to investigate wake structures and wake interaction effects. Blade loading data were analysed to quantify the increased fluctuating loads on downwind turbines. The results demonstrate the successful implementation of the coupled simulation and quantify the effect of the dynamic-turbine model.

The model is incorporated into a three-dimensional (3D) finite element model for analysis of a full-scale offshore wind turbine founded on a tripod structure using realistic structural properties. Applicability of the 3D finite element model is validated using full-scale load test data. Four different scour conditions under two wave situations are examined for the ultimate limit state (ULS), serviceability limit state (SLS) and fatigue limit state (FLS). The results show that scour has a minor effect on the natural frequency of the tripod-supported wind turbine but can significantly increase the maximum cross-sectional von Mises stress of piles under the ULS and increase the deflection of piles within nearly 20 m below the original seabed under the SLS. As for the fatigue life of the tripod structure, it can also be reduced by the effect of scour. These findings provide insights which are useful for development of safe and economic design of offshore wind turbines supported by tripod foundations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper is trying to study problems related to the quantification of the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads for the design of offshore wind turbine support structures in the offshore wind farm. Both the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic conditions in the offshore site are extremely complex resulting in the difficulty of reasonable determination for the external loads on the wind turbine support structures.

Properties of a single regular wave based on methods of linear wave theory and Stokes higher order wave theory are compared which lead to differences in the results of wave load models when these two different methods are used.

It is found that the spar-buoy floating wind turbine is more sensitive to wind loading and has larger amplitudes of platform motion in wind only cases, especially for the yaw motion. By contrast, the semi-submersible floating wind turbine is more sensitive to wave loading, especially for the second order difference-frequency wave loading.

While effective in reducing the cost of support structures, load-reducing controls produce potentially costly side effects in other wind turbine components and subsystems. This paper proposes a methodology to mitigate these side effects at the wind farm level. The interaction between the foundation and the surrounding soil is a major source of uncertainty in estimating the safety margins of support structures. The safety margins are generally closely correlated with the modal properties (natural frequencies, damping ratios). This admits the possibility of using modal identification techniques to reassess the structural safety after installing and commissioning the wind farm. Since design standards require conservative design margins, the post-installation safety assessment is likely to reveal better than expected structural safety performance. Thus, if load-reducing controls have been adopted in the structural design process, it is likely permissible to reduce the use of these during actual operation. Here, the probabilistic outcome of such a two-stage controls adaptation is analyzed. The analysis considers the structural design of a 10 MW monopile offshore wind turbine under uncertainty in the site-specific soil conditions. Two control strategies are considered in separate analyses: (a) tower feedback control to increase the support structure's fatigue life and (b) peak shaving to increase the support structure's serviceability capacity. The results show that a post-installation adaptation can reduce the farm-level side-effects of load-reducing controls by up to an order of magnitude.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,1095-4244,1099-1824,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Technol, Ctr Autonomous Marine Operat & Syst NTNU AMOS, Trondheim, NorwayEquinor ASA, Equinor Res Ctr, Trondheim, Norway",,,,2020-02-14,WOS:000511186300001,,

The main feature of the proposed procedure is the computational efficiency, which makes the numerical package suitable for design purposes when a large number of simulations are typically necessary. The small computational effort is due to (i) the use of a domain-decomposition strategy, that, according to the local wave steepness, requires the numerical solution of the nonlinear governing equations only on a limited number of reduced regions (sub-domains) of the whole space-time domain, (ii) the choice of the particular numerical method for the spatial discretization of the governing equation for the water-wave problem. Within the potential flow assumption, the Laplace equation is solved by means of a higher-order boundary-element method (HOBEM). For the time evolution of the unsteady free-surface equations the 4th-order Runge-Kutta algorithm is adopted. The compound solver is successfully applied to simulate nonlinear waves up to overturning plunging breakers, that may cause severe impact loads on the wind turbine substructure.Emphasis is finally given to wind turbine exposed to realistic environmental conditions, where the proposed tool is shown to be capable of capturing important nonlinear effects not detected by the linear models routinely adopted in the design practice.

Based on the cross-flow principle, the aerodynamic model is established by accounting for the effect of wind turbulence and dynamic stall. Then it is coupled with SIMO to achieve the integrated simulation tool SIMO-Aero which can account for blade aerodynamics, vessel hydrodynamics and system mechanical couplings. The aerodynamic code is verified by code-to-code comparisons with HAWC2. Furthermore, SIMO-Aero is applied in case studies on the wind-induced dynamic responses of a DTU 10 MW blade during installation using a jack-up crane vessel which is assumed to be rigid, including the crane, and rigidly fixed to the seabed. The characteristics of system dynamic responses prior to mating the blade onto the hub are studied. It is shown that the blade motions are dominated by the pendulum motion.

The installation of floating wind farms in deep water is recommended because the wind speed is stronger and more stable. The design of the FOWT must ensure it is able to withstand complex environmental conditions including wind, wave, current, and performance of the wind turbine. It needs simulation tools with fully integrated hydrodynamic-servo-elastic modeling capabilities for the floating offshore wind turbines. Most of the numerical simulation approaches consider only first-order hydrodynamic loads; however, the second-order hydrodynamic loads have an effect on a floating platform which is moored by a catenary mooring system. At the difference-frequencies of the incident wave components, the drift motion of a FOWT system is able to have large oscillation around its natural frequency. This paper presents the effects of second-order wave loads to the drift motion of a semi-submersible type.

The standard was based on a joint industry effort with representatives from manufacturers, developers, utility companies and certifying bodies from Europe, Asia and the US. The standard represented a condensation of all relevant requirements for floaters in existing DNV standards for the offshore oil and gas industry which were considered relevant also for offshore floating structures for support of wind turbines, supplemented by necessary adaptation to the wind turbine application. The development of the standard capitalized much on experience from development projects going on at the time, in particular the Hywind spar off the coast of western Norway, the WindFloat off the coast of Portugal and the Pelastar TLP concept. In July 2018, DNV GL published a revision of DNV-OS-J103 as a part of the harmonization of the DNV GL codes for the wind turbine industry after the merger between Det Norske Veritas (DNV) and Germanischer Lloyd (GL) in the fall of 2013. The standard was re-issued as DNVGL-ST-0119 Floating wind turbine structures. This new revision reflects the experience gained after the first issue in 2013 as well as the current trends within the industry. Since 2013, numerous guidelines addressing the design of floating structures for offshore wind turbines have been published by various certifying bodies, and an IEC technical specification on the subject is under way. In addition, several prototypes have been installed and the first small array of floating wind turbines, Hywind Scotland pilot park, are currently in operation. The most important updates in the revision of the standard include formulation of floater-specific load cases, requirements to be fulfilled to support the exemption for design of unmanned floaters with damage stability, and replacement of current consequence-class based requirements for design fatigue factors with low-consequence based factors dependent on the accessibility for inspection and repair, the aim being a safety level against fatigue similar to that which is currently targeted for bottom-fixed structures. Other topics which have been considered in the revision are the floater motion control system and its possible integration with the control and protection system for the wind turbine, the issue of how to deal with slack in tendons in the station keeping system, corrosion, anchor design and power cable design.In parallel to the revision of the standard, a new service specification for certification of floating wind turbines has been developed by DNV GL, identified as DNVGL-SE-0422 Certification of floating wind turbines. For technical requirements, the service specification refers to the revised standard, DNVGL-ST-0119.The technical paper summarizes the updates and changes in the revised standard, in addition to the content of the new service specification.",,,,,1st International Offshore Wind Technical Conference1st International Offshore Wind Technical Conference,"NOV 04-07, 2018NOV 04-07, 2018","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-5197-5,,,,,,,,,"DNV GL, N-1322 Hovik, NorwayDNV GL, D-20457 Hamburg, GermanyDNV GL, San Diego, CA USA",DNV GL,,,2018-01-01,WOS:000474938500020,,

This achievement could foster the continuous monitoring of environmental and human activities in remote oceanic locations, a key objective of the Azores International Research Center.Three recent complementary developments motivate this ambitious goal. The first is the realization of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), a novel technology that can efficiently harvest low amplitude, low frequency wave energy [1-3]. This marks a rupture from present wave farms based on low performance electromagnetic generators. The second is the discovery that motheye structures (arrays of vertical nanopillars), besides functioning as broad-spectrum, omnidirectional antireflective surfaces that increase the performance of photovoltaic cells by over 1.5x, also result in a high degree of hydrophobicity [4,5]. This finally opens the door for the large-scale development of photovoltaic modules that can sustain the Ocean environment. Finally, unmanned AUVs are appearing as a solution for the monitoring of underwater environments, including data collection of water or seabed parameters [6,7].Our work plan brings together these innovative findings to validate the aforementioned versatile energy harvesting platform able to handlepower links to charge the batteries of an AUV in a laboratory environment.

As such, scour protection may resemble a marine rocky reef and could have important ecosystem functions. While acknowledging that OWFs disrupt the marine environment, the aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of scour protection on fish assemblages, relate them to the effects of designated artificial reefs (ARs) and, ultimately, reveal how future scour protection may be tailored to support abundance and diversity of marine species. The results revealed frequent increases in abundances of species associated with hard substrata after the establishment of artificial structures (i.e., both OWFs and ARs) in the marine environment.

Wind turbines account for most of the cost involved in both onshore and offshore wind projects. Therefore, wind turbine aerodynamics is the backbone in the wind energy area as it is directly related to its performance. We first review and discuss available engineering models and the Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) methods for wind turbine aerodynamics. The widely used momentum method is restricted significantly by the availability of reliable airfoil data and its empiricism. Potential flow methods are limited by its exclusion of viscous effect. RANS methods can produce reasonable integrated quantities, but fail to capture complex flow features such as separation and vortex shedding. The hybrid RANS-LES method (HRLM), which is a technique to bridge the gap between less accurate RANS and more computational costly LES method, is a remedy to turbine aerodynamics in complex flow conditions. We then present existing HRLMs and review their applications to wind turbine aerodynamics. They have obvious advantages over the RANS models in the prediction of flow unsteadiness. Finally, we recommend the best practice guidelines for the HRLM to facilitate and promote the implementation of the HRLMs for an improved understanding of flow physics around wind turbine blades. The enhanced knowledge of complex flow characteristics will further benefit subsequent aeroelastic and aeroacoustic analysis. Therefore, the HRLM is a promising tool for the research and development of wind turbine technology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The sub-models are generated using the validated numerical tools FAST and WAMIT to obtain the frequency domain aerodynamic and hydrodynamic characteristics, respectively, for any given design candidate. The turbulent wind and irregular wave loads are incorporated in the frequency domain model using wind and wave power spectral density functions, the JONSWAP and Kaimal spectra, respectively. To validate the proposed 6 DOF frequency domain framework across standard operational environmental conditions, predicted system responses of a 5 MW NREL offshore wind turbine with three classes of reference platforms including the OC3-Hywind, the MIT/NREL TLP, and the OC4-DeepCwind semisubmersible were compared to the outputs of 6 DOF and 22 DOF FAST time domain simulations. The comparison over an aggregate of eleven environmental conditions focused on differences in predicted platform rigid body motions and structural considerations including platform surge, roll, and pitch, and rotor thrust, total blade root and tower base bending moments/fatigue loads, fairlead and anchor tensions/fatigue loads. In terms of platform motions, the worst match of frequency and time domain model predictions was seen for the OC4-DeepCwind semisubmersible with errors of 13.2% in peak displacement values. The frequency domain model predictions of rotor thrust, blade root and tower base bending moments demonstrated the largest error in the case of the OC3-Hywind spar buoy with the peak loads differing by up to 12.8%. Errors in the predictions of maximum fairlead and anchor tensions were less than 11.5% with maximum error occurring for the MIT/NREL TLP. In terms of fatigue load comparison, the blade root and tower base fatigue load predictions showed less than 9.8% errors for all the reference platforms. Comparison of the fairlead and anchor fatigue loads showed that errors were less than 13.8% with the largest error seen for the OC3-Hywind spar buoy platform.

The data required for such extrapolation are obtained by stochastic time-domain simulation of the inflow turbulence, the incident waves, and the turbine response. Prediction of accurate loads depends on assumptions made in the simulation models employed. While for the wind, inflow turbulence models are relatively well established, for wave input, the current practice is to model irregular (random) waves using a linear wave theory. Such a wave model does not adequately represent waves in shallow waters where most offshore wind turbines are being sited. As an alternative to this less realistic wave model, the present study investigates the use of irregular nonlinear (second-order) waves for estimating loads on an offshore wind turbine, with a focus on the fore-aft tower bending moment at the mudline. We use a 5MW utility-scale wind turbine model for the simulations. Using, first, simpler linear irregular wave modeling assumptions, we establish long-term loads and identify governing environmental conditions (i.e., the wind speed and wave height) that are associated with the 20-year return period load derived using the inverse first-order reliability method. We present the nonlinear irregular wave model next and incorporate it into an integrated wind-wave-response simulation analysis program for offshore wind turbines. We compute turbine loads for the governing environmental conditions identified with the linear model and also for an extreme environmental state. We show that computed loads are generally larger with the nonlinear wave modeling assumptions; this establishes the importance of using such refined nonlinear wave models in stochastic simulation of the response of offshore wind turbines.",,,,,27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering,"JUN 15-20, 2008JUN 15-20, 2008","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Estoril, PORTUGALEstoril, PORTUGAL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4823-4,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Arch & Env Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000263581700083,,

Due to maintenance and operational perspectives, offshore wind farms have been planned for installation in many coastal waters. However, development of offshore wind farms faces interference from existing maritime traffic along the planned areas. In order to safely and effectively govern marine traffic in the vicinity of wind farms and inner areas, standard criteria are suggested to allow vessels to sail the internal waters of offshore wind farm areas. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to establish allowable criteria for sailing vessels and safety zones for offshore wind farms by investigating the local regulations of various offshore wind farm cases overseas. The commended inner safety zone of wind farms is proposed to be a distance of 150% of the rotation diameter of the wind turbine rotor and a distance of 200m from the outer wind turbine for the outer safety zone. Besides this, the allowable criteria for sailing vessels within a wind farm is proposed to have an air draft of 14.47m south-west wind farm sea areas for a minimum margin to avoid hull contact through evaluation of the tide and height of a wind turbine. further studies will be needed to establish vessel sailing criteria among adjacent offshore wind farms as well as vessel sailing criteria within a single offshore wind farm.",,,,"세계 에너지 소비와 에너지 수요가 급격히 증가함에 따라 환경문제와 지속가능성에 대한 관심이 요즘 더욱 중요해지고 있다. 신재생에너지 중 해상풍력발전과 같은 깨끗하고 재생가능한 에너지자원은 대체에너지 자원으로 주목받고 있다. 유지보수 및 운영상의 관점에서 해상풍력발전은 일반적으로 연근해해역에 설치될 계획이지만 해상풍력발전단지의 개발은 계획된 풍력단지를 따라 기존의 해상교통으로부터 다양한 해상교통 간섭에 직면해 있는 실정이다. 해상풍력발전단지 인근해역 및 단지 내에서 해상교통을 안전하고 효과적으로 통제하기 위해 선박이 해상풍력단지 내에서 통항할 수 있도록 표준 기준을 제안한다. 따라서, 본 연구의 목적은 국외 해상풍력발전단지의 현지 규정을 조사하여 해상풍력발전단지에 대한 선박통항 허용 및 안전구역 기준을 수립 하는데 있다. 풍력단지의 내측 안전구역은 풍력터빈 날개 회전직경의 150%를 적용한 거리와 외측안전구역으로는 외곽에 위치한 풍력터빈으로부터 200m의 범위의 거리를 제시하였으며, 또한 풍력단지 내 선박통항 허용기준은 풍력터빈 날개의 높이와 조위를 평가하여 향후 서남해 해상풍력발전단지의 실증단지 해역에서 Air draft 14.47m가 선체 접촉을 피할 수 있는 최소 마진을 가진 기준을 제시하였다. 향후 연구과제로서, 단일 해상풍력단지 내의 선박통항 기준과 더불어 인접한 해상풍력단지 간의 선박통항 기준마련을 위한 후속연구가 필요하다.",,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1229-3431,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-01-25,KJD:ART002428739,,

Illus.,,,,,,,,,,,Book,1940,1940,"Crisis of oyster industry in Zeeland waters in the years following 1930 was due to rapid propagation of Crepidula introduced from the U.S.A., and to ravages of so-called shell disease. This compelled the Dutch Government to undertake extensive hydrological and biological studies in the basin of the Oosterschelde with the view of assisting the oyster growers by predicting the time and intensity of the attachment of oyster larvae (setting) of 0. edulis. Hydrological conditions of the Oosterschelde are characterized by an almost perfectly oscillating movement of tidal water, with the maximum current velocities of 100-150 cm./sec. at high water (50 cm./sec. in shallow places). At each tide about 3.8% of the volume of basin water replaced. Salinity is rather high, 27.7%, and constant. Summer water temp. rises above 18[degree]C but only sporadically reaches 22[degree]C. High water temp. does not directly influence spawning and swarming of 0. edulis but provides more favorable conditions for the survival and attachment of larvae. Spread of spawning of oyster population of 0. edulis over a longer period than that of non-incubatory species is due to frequent sex changes. No correlation was found between the spawning and full moon periods, as was postulated by Orton. Counting and measuring all the larvae taken daily in quantitative plankton samples (100 liters each) show that contrary to the opinion of Prytherch regarding 0. virginica, the larvae of 0. edulis do not drop to the bottom at any stage of tide but are all the time at the mercy of the tidal streams. Only about 250 out of every 1,000,000 liberated larvae attach, and 90% of the newly-set individuals die before winter. Field expts. with white and colored plates placed in water at various angles show that under natural conditions the color of the substratum has little influence on the intensity of setting; contrary to the conclusion of Cole and Jones for 0. edulis and Hopkins for 0. lurida, that the heaviest setting of larvae takes place on the under-horizontal surfaces, the author concludes that more spat settles on upper surfaces. Vertical surfaces are the least suitable for attachment. From an analysis of setting records inference is made that environmental conditions such as temp. and salinity have but little direct influence on setting. Critical examination of evidence presented by Prytherch that Cu content of sea water induces the attachment and metamorphosis of the oyster larvae forces the author to reject Prytherch's hypothesis as untenable and to conclude that Prytherch's own data cannot be used in support of his assumption. Cu content of water has no influence on the intensity of setting. The intensity of setting at a given station is detd. by the number of full grown larvae passing over it in the course of the tide. Predition of setting at short notice is possible. It requires daily recording of the water-temp. and frequent detns. of the number and size of the oyster larvae for volume of water. The best setting may be expected in places where the number of full-grown larvae is large at the time when the current velocities are small. Besides original observations, author gives an extensive and critical review of widely scattered literature on oyster biology. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: P. S.

The potential opportunities have led to considerable effort in the development and deployment of marine renewable energy devices, such as offshore wind turbines as well as wave and tidal stream technologies. Therefore, simulation tools that allow the simulation of the entire structure's behaviour under wave and current loads are needed to assess the safety, survivability and viability for marine energy converter devices and offshore structures, and their environmental impacts on ecosystems and sediment systems.The main aim of the project is to quantify the structural response of a offshore floating structure and offshore pile-supported foundation subjected to various wave loads and a strong tidal current under extreme events. Numerical simulations will be carried out and compared with experimental measurements, which will reveal with great details the fluid-structure interaction of the floating offshore energy device and impact force exerting on pile-structures subjected to waves and currents. In addition, the developed fully coupled fluid-structure interaction simulation tool can also be used in many other engineering applications, such as in biomedical engineering to study blood flow in movable and deformable on geometries based on medical imaging.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2558593,,,,,,,,Cardiff University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15399101,,

Alternative modeling assumptions for randomness in the gross wind environment and in the extreme response given wind conditions to establish nominal design loads are studied. Accuracy in design load predictions based on use of the inverse first-order reliability method (that assumes a linearized limit state surface) is also investigated. An example is presented where three alternative nominal load definitions are used to estimate extreme flapwise bending loads at a blade root for a 600 kW three-bladed, stall-regulated horizontal-axis wind turbine located at onshore and offshore sites that were assumed to experience the same mean wind speed but different turbulence intensities. It is found that second-order (curvature-type) corrections to the linearized limit state function assumption inherent in the inverse first-order reliability approach are insignificant. Thus, we suggest that the inverse first-order reliability method is an efficient and accurate technique of predicting extreme loads. Design loads derived from a full random characterization of wind conditions as well as short-term maximum response (given wind conditions) may be approximated reasonably well by simpler models that include only the randomness in the wind environment but account for response variability by employing appropriately derived higher-than-median fractiles of the extreme bending loads conditional on specified inflow parameters. In the various results discussed, it is found that the higher relative turbulence at the onshore site leads to larger blade bending design loads there than at the offshore site. Also, for both onshore and offshore environments accounting for response variability is found to be slightly more important at longer return periods (i.e., safer designs).",,,,,,,,,18,1,0,0,0,0,19,,,0199-6231,1528-8986,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas, Dept Civil Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,,2004-11-01,WOS:000225470900013,,

Among these are achieving adequate stiffness to prevent excessive blade deflection, preventing buckling failure, ensuring adequate fatigue life under variable wind loading combined with gravitational loading, and minimizing the occurrence and consequences of production defects.

Re-configuration is intended to be a built-in capability to be used as a repair strategy, based on these existing functionalities provided by the components. The possible solutions can range from using information from adjacent wind turbines, such as wind speed and direction, to setting up different operational modes, for instance re-wiring, re-connecting, changing parameters or control strategy. The methodology described in this paper is based on qualitative physics and consists of a fault diagnosis system based on a model-based reasoner (MBR), and on a functional redundancy designer (FRD).

The data used for the study consists of daily average wind speed, temperature and atmospheric pressure collected over a period of eleven years (2001-2012) at an anemometer height of 10 m. The data is obtained from South African Weather Services and the analysis is performed using statistical approach. Some commercially available wind turbine ranging from 10 kW to 1650 kW are simulated using HOMER simulation software in different scenario to determine the combination of wind turbine, battery and power electronic converter that could meet the electrical energy demand of SANAE IV with lowest Net Present Cost (NPC) and the Cost of Energy (COE) over 25 year life cycle of the project. The results show that Vesleskarvet has exceptional wind resource with average wind speed of 10.9 m/s and standard deviation of 6.3 m/s. The minimum wind speed in the period under study is 0 m/s and maximum value of 41.9 m/s. The average wind potential density (2001-2001) is 1650 W/m(2). The HOMER optimization result reveals that 15 numbers of PGE20/25 wind turbine with rated power of 25 kW, hub height of 25 m, cut in wind speed of 3.5 m/s, rated wind speed of 9 m/s and cut-out wind speed of 25 m/s seems suitable to meet the electrical energy demand of SANAE IV with NPC of $1,336,262, operating cost of $976,500 and COE of $0.102.

Single caisson foundations (or monopods) for offshore wind turbines are subjected to lateral cyclic loading from wind and waves acting on the structure. Recent studies have considered the response of suction caissons to such loading in sand, but have generally been limited to a few thousand cycles, whereas offshore wind turbines will generally experience millions of loading cycles over their lifetime. This paper presents the results from a programme of caisson tests in sand, clay and sand over clay seabed profiles, where each test involved about one million cycles of lateral load. The capacity and rotation response is shown to approach that measured in the sand seabed when the sand- clay interface is located at or beneath the caisson skirt tip. In contrast to previously published studies in sand, one-way cyclic loading is the most onerous loading symmetry for a layered seabed with a sand thickness equal to half the skirt length. However, the rotation for this seabed profile is essentially identical if the load is sustained or cyclic, provided that the cyclic loading remains one way. Lateral cyclic loading was seen to increase caisson capacity by up to 30% - with a bias towards clay-dominated seabed profiles - and stiffness by up to 50%.

In this study, several wind turbine designs have been analyzed and optimized designs have been proposed for low wind speed areas around the world mainly for domestic energy consumption. The wind speed range of 4-12 mph is considered, which is selected based on the average wind speeds in the Atlanta, GA and surrounding areas. These areas have relatively low average wind speeds compared to various other parts of the United States. Traditionally wind energy utilization is limited to areas with higher wind speeds. In reality a lot of areas in the world have low average wind speeds and demand high energy consumption. In most cases, wind turbines are installed in remote offshore or away from habitat high wind locations, causing heavy investment in installation and maintenance, and loss of energy transfer over long distance. A few more advantages of small scale wind turbines include reduced visibility, less noise and reduced detrimental environmental effects such as killing of birds, when compared to traditional large turbines. With the latest development in wind turbine technology it is now possible to employ small scale wind turbines that have much smaller foot print and can generate enough energy for small businesses or residential applications. The low speed wind turbines are typically located near residential areas, and are much smaller in sizes compared to the large out of habitat wind turbines. In this study, several designs of vertical and horizontal axes wind turbines are modeled using SolidWorks e.g. no-airfoil theme, airfoil blade, Savonius rotor etc. Virtual aerodynamic analysis is performed using SolidWorks Flow simulation software, and then optimization of the designs is performed based on maximizing the starting rotational torque and ultimate power generation capacity. From flow simulations, forces on the wind turbine blades and structures are calculated, and used in subsequent stress analysis to confirm structural integrity. Critical insight into low wind speed turbines is obtained using various configurations, and optimized designs have been proposed. The study will help in the practical and effective utilization of wind energy for the areas around the globe having low average wind speeds.",,,,,9th ASME International Conference on Energy Sustainability9th ASME International Conference on Energy Sustainability,"JUN 28-JUL 02, 2015JUN 28-JUL 02, 2015","ASME, Adv Energy Syst Div; ASME, Solar Energy DivASME, Adv Energy Syst Div; ASME, Solar Energy Div","San Diego, CASan Diego, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5685-7,,,,,,,,,"Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Marietta, GA USAKennesaw State Univ, Dept Syst & Ind Engn, Marietta, GA USA",,,,2016-05-18,WOS:000374279500062,,

To this end, a coupled two-dimensional idealized numerical model of the ocean and sediment layers, forced by an idealized offshore wind turbine wake is used. The turbine wake impacts the ocean surface and for strong wind and water layer thickness higher than 20 m, large scale eddies of the size comparable to the wake thickness are generated, leading to a turbulent dynamics in the ocean.The turbulence in the ocean is controlled by the shallow wake parameter S. The turbulent ocean dynamics is numerically integrated using time dependent simulations at fine horizontal resolution (1 m). From these simulations, eddy coefficients parametrizating the turbulent fluxes are proposed to be used in larger-scale (RANS) models. The ocean dynamics and the parameter values depend mainly on S. The ocean dynamics is laminar (S > 7.10(-2)), has a localized (7.10-2 < 7.10(-2)) or domain wide turbulent (S < 3.10(-2)) behavior. In the first two cases, changes in seabed elevation are around a few millimeters per month. For the third case, averaged over several days, changes decreases to a few tenths of millimeters per month. This is due to the alternating local velocity which transports sediments back and forth. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Design standards for floating offshore wind turbines such as the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Guide for Building and Classing Floating Offshore Wind Turbine Installations are relatively new and few if any floating wind turbines have yet experienced the prescribed design extreme environmental conditions. Only a few pilot floating turbines have been deployed in Europe and Japan. These turbines have been designed for long return period storm events and are not likely to see their extreme design conditions during early deployment periods because of the low probability of occurrence. This paper presents data collected for an intermediate scale floating semi-submersible turbine intentionally placed offshore Maine in a carefully selected site that subjects the prototype to scale extreme conditions on a frequent basis. This prototype, called VolturnUS 1:8, was the first grid-connected offshore wind turbine in the Americas, and is a 1:8 scale model of a 6MW prototype. The test site produces with a high probability 1:8 scale wave environments, and a commercial turbine has been selected so that the wind environment/rotor combination produces 1:8-scale aerodynamic loads appropriate for the site wave environment. In the winter of 2013-2014, this prototype has seen the equivalent of 50year to 500year return period storms exercising it to the limits prescribed by design standards, offering a unique look at the behavior of a floating turbine subjected to extreme design conditions. Performance data are provided and compared to full-scale predicted values from numerical models. There are two objectives in presenting this data and associated analysis: (i) validate numerical aeroelastic hydrodynamic coupled models and (ii) investigate the performance of a near full-scale floating wind turbine in a real offshore environment that closely matches the prescribed design conditions from the ABS Guide.

The failure location and the maximum stress determined from a static numerical analysis are first discussed. To strengthen the traditional grout joint, two modified joints were designed, constructed, and compared with the traditional joint. Both numerical and experimental three-point bending tests of a small-scale monopile foundation were performed.

Therefore, secondary data from studies on wind turbines, which were published in the past 20 years were assessed. The data was categorized into three configurations, i.e. onshore single turbines, onshore wind farms and offshore wind farms. Within a multivariate analysis, featuring a linear regression model approach, the datasets retrieved from the literature were evaluated. The effect variable was the specific GWP, normalized to the function unit gCO2-equ/kWh electricity. Cause variables were (i) the capacity factor, (ii) the rated power and (iii) the annual energy yield (AEY), (iv) the hub height and (v) the rotor diameter. In a secondary part this study showed the quantity of uncertainty, which is present in LCA studies on wind turbines by evaluating generic wind turbine configurations, which were present in the ecoinvent database. Conclusively, a sensitivity analysis on the influence of the capacity factor on the GWP was conducted.For onshore single turbines and wind farms a negative correlation was observed between the turbine size and the GWP. A highly significant negative correlation was found between the AEY and the GWP. However, the AEY needed to be log-transformed first. Other cause variables were either collinear to the AEY or showed a weak correlation. For offshore wind turbines similar results could not be presented and none of the cause variable could explain the effect variable. The sample size was however low, as only few studies were conducted for offshore plants.The uncertainty analysis showed that generally low uncertainties are present during the modelling phase of the LCA of wind turbines, which suggests that the processes are well understood and documented. The sensitivity analysis on the capacity factor resulted in a non-linear, hyperbolic progression with respect to the GWP. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Fish assemblages were dominated by two-spotted gobies (Gobiusculus flavescens) that were found in large shoals in close association with the vertical surface. At the seabed, close to the foundation, the black goby (Gobius niger) was recorded in large numbers. The most obvious difference in fish densities was found between wind-power foundations extending through the entire water column and the surrounding open waters.

The present study shows that the placement of offshore wind turbines gives the potential for habitat creation, which may thus be regarded as compensation for habitat lost. Using current design criteria and construction methods, the analysis here indicates that the net amount of habitat created by the most common design of offshore wind turbine, the monopile, is up to 2.5 times the amount of area lost through the placement, thus providing a net gain even though the gained habitat may be of a different character to the one that lost. Hence, the study raises important issues for marine nature conservation managers. The study also provides suggestions for further work in order to increase the empirical evidence for the value of mitigation, compensation and habitat creation.

By providing auxiliary connection paths, the suggested topology reduces the overvoltage of the units and hence maintains fault-free units operational following a severe failure. Hence, the efficiency of a wind farm increases considerably upon any failure occurrence. To show the merits of the suggested topology, the captured power during a failure has been calculated and fairly compared with that of the conventional SP topology, considering the excess cost of the suggested topology due to additional connection paths. To investigate the performances of both topologies and their feasibility, a collector system including 12 wind turbine generators has been simulated in time domain software environment.

At the same time, there has been a realisation that, in order to exploit fully the opportunities for renewable power generation, it is necessary to be aware of (and to adjust to) a wide range of environmental disturbances in the vicinity of the power generation installations themselves. The present project examines this potential conflict for the case of a tidal stream turbine (TST) - a device installed in tidal waters to generate power by the rotation of a set of rotor blades driven by the tidal current. It is known that flow passing TST support structure combined with the rotation of the turbine rotors produces a turbulent downstream wake that can be sufficiently energetic to disturb the stability of the sediments on the sea bed on which the turbine is constructed and affect the sediment suspension. This may have significant impact on the sea floor topography and adverse consequences for the indigenous marine flora and fauna displaced by the geomorphologiocal changes and changes of suspended sediment in water. As a result, large-scale implementation of TST devices is often viewed with serious concern by environmental and ecological agencies, the fisheries authorities and local communities dependent economically on the affected zones. Thus far, little is known about the nature of the pressure distributions within the turbulent wakes of the rotors and the mechanisms by which these wake flows perturb the sediments in water and on the seabed. For cases in which several tidal stream turbines are constructed in an array, the configuration of the sea bed sediments is subjected to complex pressure distributions arising from from each of the constituent installations and the prediction of sea floor sediment response is even more uncertain. Because of these knowledge gaps in predicting the sea bed response, developers of TST projects have presently to carry out costly environmental monitoring programs in order to obtain environmental permission for installation of devices. The marine environment, especially in those areas that are subject to strong tidal currents, is usually subject to complex sediment transport dynamics. The main aim of the proposed research is, therefore, to develop advanced computational tools to overcome the above knowledge gaps, in order to predict the consequences of complex interactions between tidal flow, tidal stream turbines and the sea floor sediment bed under combined waves and tidal conditions. The research will build upon results from previous research programmes such as Supergen I and II. To tackle the above uncertainties, computational and laboratory modelling studies will be carried out (i) to investigate the fundamental processes controlling the complex flow-TST-sediment interactions and (ii) to improve practical prediction methods that can be used not only by engineers in full-scale TST planning and design but also by regulatory authorities monitoring environmental and ecological consequences of installing TST arrays. The research will take a systematic, multidisciplinary, evidence-based approach involving analysis, physical model experiments and numerical modelling components to address and delineate the key processes affecting the sea bed response to TST placements in coastal waters",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/J010359/1,,,,,,,,University of Dundee,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15301275,,

These fluctuations not only decrease the output of the wind power generation system, but also increase the fatigue load of the structure and various equipment mounted on it. Therefore, when designing FOWTs, efficient performance with respect to waves and other external conditions must be ensured. In this study, a model test was performed with a 10 MW floating offshore wind turbine. The model test was performed by scaling down a 10 MW FOWT model that was designed with reference to a 5 MW wind turbine and a semisubmersible platform by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the DeepCwind project. A scale ratio of 1:90 was used for the model test. The depth of the East Sea was considered as 144 m and, to match the water depth with the geometric similarity of mooring lines, mooring tables were installed. The load cases used in the model test are combined environmental conditions, which are combined uniform wind, regular waves and uniform current. Especially, Model tests with regular waves are especially necessary, because irregular waves are superpositions of regular waves with various periods. Therefore, this study aimed to understand the characteristics of the FOWTs caused by regular waves of various periods. Furthermore, in this model test, the effect of current was investigated using the current data of the East Sea.

However, there is a lack of more integral validation where the interaction between the foundation and the structure is taken into account.

The OWT structure and the environmental actions are implemented in the aero-servo-hydro-elastic code 3DFloat. Two foundation models and two calibration approaches are evaluated.

Finally, an optimal controller is designed as a benchmark and compared to a conventional PI-controller using only the rotor speed as input. Here, the previously found system properties, especially the difficulties to damp responses to wave excitation, are confirmed and verified through a spectral analysis with realistic environmental conditions. This comparison also assesses the quality of the employed simplified linear simulation model compared to the nonlinear model and shows that such an efficient frequency-domain evaluation for control design is feasible.",,,,,Conference on Science of Making Torque from Wind (TORQUE)Conference on Science of Making Torque from Wind (TORQUE),"OCT 05-07, 2016OCT 05-07, 2016",,"Munich, GERMANYMunich, GERMANY",32,0,0,0,0,0,35,,,1742-6588,1742-6596,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Univ Stuttgart SWE, Allmandring 5B, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany",Univ Stuttgart SWE,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000436325703012,,

Forces and moments generated by the effects of winds, waves and currents subject these connections to variable amplitude cyclic loads. In the harsh marine offshore environment areas such as bolt threads are vulnerable to fatigue cracking and failure. Their structural integrity and life are influenced by coatings, lubricants, bolt size, design and tension, manufacturing tolerances and flange contact.This paper presents a review of the main challenges for fatigue life assessment of M72 bolted connections used in offshore wind turbines to connect the monopile to the transition piece, and the factors affecting the fatigue performance. Existing standards and guidelines along with different fatigue assessment methods presented in the literature are discussed in terms of their suitability for fatigue life assessment of M72 bolted connections for offshore wind turbines. One of the key challenges in fatigue life assessment of large scale bolts (e.g. M72) is the lack of experimental data points from which fatigue design curves can be derived. Recommendations are made for how to improve the current best practice for fatigue assessment of large scale bolted connections in the offshore wind industry and potential areas for further investigation are proposed for future research.

With offshore wind turbines growing larger and with increasing water depth, jacket structures are attracting increased attention because they appear to be cost-effective, but they are still at an early stage of development for use in the offshore wind industry. This paper aims to design a jacket structure to support a 5 MW wind turbine in 33 m deep water for a Korean offshore demonstration project and to investigate the effects of different modeling parameters (including joint can, overlap, flooding of the member, marine growth and mass of the transition piece) on the dynamic response of an offshore wind turbine with a jacket substructure. For this purpose, modal analysis and aero-servo-hydro-elastic simulation with varying modeling parameters are performed under Korean environmental conditions. The results show that joint can, overlap and marine growth strongly affect the dynamic response and there is a small effect on the natural frequencies of the designed structure. Choosing the appropriate transition piece mass may reduce the extreme loads in the members.

External condition-based extreme responses are reproduced by coupling a fully nonlinear wave kinematic solver with a hydro-aero-elastic simulator. The transient nonlinear free surface problem of water waves is formulated assuming the potential theory and a higher-order boundary element method (HOBEM) is used to discretize Laplace's equation. For temporal evolution a second-order Taylor series expansion is implemented. The code is successfully adopted to simulate overturning plunging breakers, which give rise to dangerous impact loads when they break against wind turbine substructures. Emphasis is also placed on the development of a global simulation framework that aims at embedding the wave simulator into a more general stochastic environment. Indeed, first a linear irregular sea is generated by a spectral approach, then only on critical sub-domains, where wave impacts are expected, the fully nonlinear solver is invoked for a more refined simulation. This permits to systematically account for dangerous effects on the structural response (which would be missed by adopting linear or weakly nonlinear wave theories alone) without penalizing the computational effort.

Details are presented as far as the physical modelling of the wind turbine with the use of a redesigned small-scale rotor and of the Power Take-Off mechanism of the Wave Energy Converters (WECs) with the use of a configuration that is based on a mechanical rotary damper. Tests with quasi-static excitation, motion decay, regular and irregular waves without and with wind that is uniform are conducted on an 1:50 scale physical model. The experimental data are compared with numerical predictions obtained by a fully coupled numerical model using Simo/Riflex tool. A good agreement is observed between experimental and numerical predictions. The combined operation of WECs doesn't affect the tension of mooring lines nor the acceleration of nacelle and the bending moment in tower's base.

In total we tracked 375 porpoise groups and 157 seals during play-back experiments, and 380 porpoise groups and 141 surfacing seals during controls. Both species showed a distinct reaction to wind-turbine noise.

This involves simulation of the stochastic inflow wind field on the rotor plane, of irregular (random) waves on the support structure, and of the turbine response. Obtaining realistic response of the turbine depends, among other factors, on appropriate modeling of the incident wind and waves. The current practice for modeling waves on offshore wind turbines is limited to the representation of linear irregular waves. While such models are appropriate for deep waters, they are not accurate representations of waves in shallow waters where offshore wind turbines are most commonly sited. In shallow waters, waves are generally nonlinear in nature. It is, therefore, of interest to assess the influence of alternative wave models on the behavior of wind turbines (e.g., on the tower response) as well as on extrapolated long-term turbine loads. The expectation is that nonlinear (second-order) irregular waves can better describe waves in shallow waters. In this study, we investigate differences in turbine response statistics and in long-term load predictions that arise from the use of alternative wave models.We compute loads on the monopile support structure of a 5MW offshore wind turbine model for several representative environmental states where we focus on differences in estimates of the extreme tower bending moment at the mudline due to linear and nonlinear waves. Finally, we compare long-term load predictions using inverse reliability procedures with both the linear and nonlinear wave models. We present convergence criteria that may be used to establish accurate 20-year loads and discuss comparative influences of wind versus waves in long-term load prediction.",,,,,"28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE)28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE)","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Honolulu, HIHonolulu, HI",4,1,0,0,0,0,4,,,,,978-0-7918-4344-4,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000286404300133,,

This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a computationally-efficient reliability framework for OWT support structures, based on the use of a kriging model to approximate the response of the system, capturing both the dynamic behaviour of the structure and inherent uncertainties. The surrogate model is built with sample points from stochastic fully coupled simulations in the time-domain.

This paper describes a novel methodology to enable quantifying and evaluating the environmental and economic benefits that new technologies and fuels could allow in the marine sector.The proposed techno economic and environmental analysis approach enables consistent assessment of different traditional propulsion systems (diesel engine and gas turbine) when operated in conjunction with a novel environmental friendly technology, such as a vertical axis wind turbine. The techno-economic and environmental assessment is focused on the potential reduction in fuel consumption and pollutant emissions that may be accrued while operating on typical Sea Lines Of Communication (Mediterranean, North Sea, Atlantic).The study demonstrates the benefits of the installation of two vertical axis wind turbines on the deck of a ship in conjunction with conventional power plants. The analysis indicates that the performance of the wind turbines and the corresponding benefits strongly depend on the routes and environment in which they operate (therefore favourable wind conditions) allowing fuel savings from 14% (in the gas turbine case) to 16% (in the diesel engine case). The study also indicates that possible benefits may diminish for weak wind conditions.The results reported in this paper establish the economic benefits of installing vertical axis wind turbines in conjunction with conventional technology (Diesel and Gas Turbine Power plants) when installed on a ship travelling through the Atlantic Ocean. The primary purpose of this study is to introduce a methodology to demonstrate the application, performance and economic benefits of the technology at a preliminary design phase and further form a foundation for more elaborate analysis on the subject in the future.

The high-quality wind environments, unique to these tests, were realized in the offshore basin via a novel wind machine which exhibited low swirl and turbulence intensity in the flow field. Recorded data from the floating wind turbine models include rotor torque and position, tower top and base forces and moments, mooring line tensions, six-axis platform motions and accelerations at key locations on the nacelle, tower, and platform. A comprehensive overview of the test program, including basic system identification results, is covered in an associated paper in this conference.In this paper, the results of a comprehensive data analysis are presented which illuminate the unique coupled system behavior of the three floating wind turbines subjected to combined wind and wave environments. The relative performance of each of the three systems is discussed with an emphasis placed on global motions, flexible tower dynamics and mooring system response. The results demonstrate the unique advantages and disadvantages of each floating wind turbine platform.",,,,,"31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUL 01-06, 2012JUL 01-06, 2012","Petrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivPetrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL",4,1,0,0,0,0,4,,,,,978-0-7918-4494-6,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maine, Orono, ME USA",,,,2013-11-05,WOS:000324507000053,,

In this article, the nonlinear hydrostatic stiffness of a floating spar platform was analytically derived with the aim of studying the effect of hydrostatic nonlinearity on the dynamic response. The floating wind turbine was modeled as a multibody system for which the equation of motion was obtained by using the Newton-Euler approach. The mooring lines connected to the floating wind turbine were modeled quasi-statically using catenary equations.

We assess the degree of usefulness and the limitations of different remote technologies for studying bird behaviour in relation to bird-turbine collisions at offshore wind farms. Radar is one of the more powerful tools available to describe the movement of birds in three-dimensional space. Although radar cannot measure bird-turbine collisions directly, it offers the opportunity to quantify input data for collision models. Thermal Animal Detection System ( TADS) is an infra red-based technology developed as a means of gathering highly specific information about actual collision rates, and also for parameterizing predictive collision models. TADS can provide information on avoidance behaviour of birds in close proximity to turbine rotor-blades, flock size and flight altitude. This review also assesses the potential of other ( some as yet undeveloped) techniques for collecting information on bird flight and behaviour, both pre- and post-construction of the offshore wind farms.

The announcement of this ambitious offshore energy program has stimulated significant interests among various industrial sectors, as well as academic and R&D institutions in Taiwan. The offshore wind turbines are exposed to extreme environmental conditions and high dynamic stresses. Incipient damage must be detected at the earliest stage possible in order to plan and take reasonable repair measures in due time. This can prevent the development of severe damage and thus lower the repair costs. Periodic inspections are not sufficient for an early detection of damage. Continuous monitoring ensures a higher level of safety. Wireless structural health monitoring (SHM) and risk-based reliability management (RRM) are cost-effective, infrastructural solutions to stable and increased energy yield. This paper presents an overview and prospect on the development of indigenous SHM/RRM for Taiwan offshore wind turbines to be erected in the coastal regions west of Taiwan.

A two-modality vessel model is presented to account for the vessel free motion and motion whilst in contact with a wind-turbine.

Recently, a lot of researchers have carried out on the issue of offshore wind turbine. Because of incapability of most of software programs to simulate gyroscopic effect of rotating rotors, in this articles a significant effort has been made to fabricate and test an offshore wind turbine under different rotor rotation velocities and different heading angle of wind so as to obtain the effects of these parameters on structure responses. Study on the response of a wind turbine under environmental loads has had a notable importance due to the fact that structure behavior can strongly affect procedure of modeling and optimizing wind turbine structures. On the other hand, frequency-domain structural response of a wind turbine can also make engineers be informed about of appropriate mooring system for a special environmental condition. Consequently, it has been observed that increasing the rotor rotation velocity leads the peak of spectrums shift to a higher frequency due to the gyroscopic effect appeared as a damping term, and changing heading angle of wind may lead to a change in heave and pitch amplitudes in the time domain response, and heave, sway and surge motion in frequency response.",,,,,,,,,11,1,0,0,0,0,12,,,1735-1472,1735-2630,,,,,,,,,,"Sharif Univ Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Tehran, IranQUB, Belfast BT9 5AG, Antrim, North Ireland",QUB,,,2018-11-13,WOS:000448672700004,,

The whole impact process is solved using the dual coordinate system, where a local stretched coordinate system is adopted to determine both the shape and location of the initial impact zone, while the global coordinate system is applied to track further development of both the upper and lower jets. A higher-order boundary element method is introduced to establish water integral equations of the main fluid domain and the thin jet, which are combined together with the match conditions of pressure and velocity on the interface. By employing auxiliary functions, the temporal derivative of velocity potential is accurately obtained to decouple the mutual dependence of body and fluid motions.

Through the hinged condition at the fairlead location, the motion equations of the wind turbine and its mooring system are simultaneously solved using the Newton-Raphson iterative method.

Offshore wind farm projects are increasingly turning to alternative multipod foundations (for example tetrapod, jacket and tripods) supported on shallow foundations to reduce the environmental effects of piling noise. However the characteristics of these foundations under dynamic loading or long term cyclic wind turbine loading are not fully understood. This paper summarises the results from a series of small scaled tests (1:100, 1:150 and 1:200) of a complete National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) wind turbine model on three types of foundations: monopiles, symmetric tetrapod and asymmetric tripod. The test bed used consists of either kaolin clay or sand and up to 1.4 million loading cycles were applied. The results showed that the multipod foundations (symmetric or asymmetric) exhibit two closely spaced natural frequencies corresponding to the rocking modes of vibration in two principle axes. Furthermore, the corresponding two spectral peaks change with repeated cycles of loading and they converge for symmetric tetrapods but not for asymmetric tripods. From the fatigue design point of view, the two spectral peaks for multipod foundations broaden the range of frequencies that can be excited by the broadband nature of the environmental loading (wind and wave) thereby impacting the extent of motions. Thus the system lifespan (number of cycles to failure) may effectively increase for symmetric foundations as the two peaks will tend to converge. However, for asymmetric foundations the system life may continue to be affected adversely as the two peaks will not converge. In this sense, designers should prefer symmetric foundations to asymmetric foundations. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The insulation system of specimen has performed an excellent resistance to the marine environment due to the electrical shielding effect of the semi-conductive slot coating.",,,,,IEEE Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena (CEIDP)IEEE Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena (CEIDP),"OCT 20-23, 2013OCT 20-23, 2013",IEEEIEEE,"Shenzhen, PEOPLES R CHINAShenzhen, PEOPLES R CHINA",3,1,0,0,0,0,4,,,0084-9162,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Elect Insulat & Power Equipment, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaXiangtan Elect Mfg Co Ltd, Offshore Wind Generat Technol & Testing State Key, Xiangtan 411101, Hunan, Peoples R China",Xiangtan Elect Mfg Co Ltd,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000360957000011,,

According to the International Energy Agency wind task 27, a recommended practice on micrositing of small wind turbines in the areas of high turbulence needs to be formulated. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study on the wind turbulence characteristics over the Engineering and Technology Building (ETB) on campus based on the urban atmospheric boundary layer (UABL) inflow condition is conducted, and the results are validated by wind lidar measurements. The micrositing method of RMWT is developed based on the CFD simulations, which contains preliminary and accurate micrositings. Results from this investigation suggest that the optimum installation height ranges from 1.51, to 1.79 times the height of building and the best locations are at the forefront where the wind acceleration reaches the maximum, as the wind direction varies. The methods developed in this paper can provide a feasible scheme for micrositing of RMWTs in urban environment and the results can also serve as a recommendation to this topic.

Off the US coast, 60% of the offshore wind lies in deep water (greater than 60m) where the development of Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) hull technology will likely be required in lieu of fixed bottom technology such as jacket structures. The United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the offshore wind community commonly refer to 60m as the transition point between fixed bottom structures and floating structures due to economic reasons. Floating wind turbines deployed in the harsh offshore marine environment require the use of materials that are cost-effective, corrosion resistant, require little maintenance and are highly durable. This has led the University of Maine to develop a concrete hull technology called VolturnUS for full-scale 6MW FOWTs. In this work, experimental testing was conducted to verify the performance of the concrete under operational, serviceability, and extreme loading conditions as required by the American Bureau of Shipping Guide for Building and Classing Floating Offshore Wind Turbines. The testing included structural testing sub-components of the hull and served as experimental verification of American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) concrete design methodology which is currently approved and being used to design the first commercial scale FOWTs in the United States. Two 6MW wind turbines supported on VolturnUS concrete hulls will be used for the New England Aqua Ventus I project.

Unfortunately, in the recent years some cases of degradation on certain telecommunication systems have arisen due to the presence of wind farms, and expensive and technically complex corrective measurements have been needed. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the impact of wind turbines on the telecommunication services. The paper describes the potential affections to several telecommunication services, the methodology to evaluate this impact, and mitigation measures to be taken in case of potential degradation, both preventive and corrective. The telecommunication services included in this review are those that have demonstrated to be more sensitive to nearby wind turbines: weather, air traffic control and marine radars, radio navigation systems, terrestrial television and fixed radio links. The methods described in the paper allow a thorough case-by-case analysis before the wind farm is installed, taking into account the particular features of each installation and the involved services. The prediction of the potential impact makes it possible to propose alternative solutions in order to assure the coexistence between the wind turbines and the telecommunication services.

However, its performance is susceptible to wind turbines which are usually installed on the shore. The size of a wind turbine is much larger than the wavelength of radio waves at UHF band, which results in large radar cross section.

In this paper, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the active power dispatch of wind farms under generator cooling system faults. The optimization objectives include avoiding the further deterioration of the generator fault, reducing unnecessary power loss of the faulty wind turbine, tracking the power demand from the Transmission System Operator (TSO), and reducing the power fluctuation caused by the PSO algorithm.

Description of the marine environment is based on a variety of techniques taking the stochastic nature of both, the wind and the water waves into account. The wind turbine is a highly dynamic system including effects of heavy rotating machinery and other significant nonlinearities leading to static, cyclic, transient, and stochastic loads. Due to the nature of the external loading, the system properties and the turbine design lifetime, offshore wind turbines are prone to fatigue-driven failure. For loads assessment, aero-hydro-servo-elastic tools are used including the coupled effects of the environment and the turbine to simulate the overall lifetime of the turbine in the harsh marine environment. These tools are constantly further developed and adapted to the needs of a fast-growing industry and newly arising turbine concepts. Engineering approaches to allow for certification and reliable design are summarized in extensive guidelines and standards supporting engineers in daily design work.

Loads data for the extreme response analysis involve time-domain simulations for a range of sea states representative of expected site-specific metocean conditions. To gain deeper insight into the dynamic behavior of this system and to obtain long-term loads efficiently and accurately, two studies are carried out sequentially. First, the short-term response of the integrated system is studied based on 1-h simulations for sea states identified using the Environmental Contour method for a 50-year return period. Response extremes for the integrated wind turbine system as well as system sensitivity to metocean conditions are studied. Next, the long-term response associated with the 50-year return period is estimated using statistical extrapolation based on loads derived from the 1-h simulations. Inverse First-Order Reliability Method procedures are employed to seek appropriate response quantile levels, e.g., the median response for 2D Inverse FORM. A more comprehensive 3D approach, which accounts for system response uncertainties, improves long-term response estimates. A proposed adaptive procedure in the 3D approach helps determine the number of simulations needed to guarantee accuracy in the long-term response estimation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The joint type support structure was first classified, and the fatigue damage was then calculated using the Miner's rule. Finally, Broyden's method was used to design the member thickness to meet the design requirements of the OWT fatigue life. The numerical study indicated that this parallel fatigue procedure is highly efficient even when using a personal computer. For the fatigue issue of OWT support structures, this work indicates that the maximum damage is due to the power production plus the occurrence of faults for a hub wind speed that is a little greater than the rated wind speed. However, the major part of the fatigue damage is still generated during the power production. Under high wind conditions, parked wind turbines produce minimum wind forces, so fatigue damage is primarily from wave loads. This type of fatigue damage can control the fatigue design if the wave load is large. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, the electric power expected to be provided by various state of the art technologies was also evaluated. For this reason, several reference points were considered in the coastal environments of the two areas targeted. In order to assess the wind potential in these locations, 12 year of data coming from the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction were processed and analyzed. From the analysis of the wind power density (corresponding to a height of 80m), it was possible to evaluate the spatial and seasonal distributions of the wind resources, and also to identify some hot spot areas. Since the regions located near the shoreline are under the influence of the diurnal/nocturnal fluctuations, a special attention was paid to this aspect. This is especially due to the fact that the power output of a wind farm project is supposed to be significantly influenced by such variations. In the second part of the work, several offshore wind turbines were considered and their performances were evaluated in relationship with the local wind patterns. Based on these results, we can conclude that important variations may occur between the diurnal and the nocturnal intervals, in terms of both wind velocity and direction, while on a regional scale the northern parts of the Black and the Caspian seas seem to present more consistent wind energy potential.

Collision mortality was also assessed by monitoring circular plots and transect lines located under human-made structures. Petrel flight activity showed a bimodal pattern, with the majority of the movements recorded in the hours previous to sunrise. Most petrels (96%) moved along major ravines that descend from the highlands to the south-southeastern coast of the island. Significant differences in passage rates were found between the project and control sites, with only five petrels recorded on the site selected for turbine installation. Although our data suggest that wind farms will not be more detrimental to petrels than other existing man-made structures, a word of caution is made because even very low levels of additional mortality might be significant for a species with such low productivity and slow maturation rates.

Birds' flight heights greatly influence this risk, yet height estimates are currently available only using methods such as radar- or ship-based observations over limited areas. Bird-borne data-loggers have the potential to provide improved estimates of collision risk and here, we used data from Global Position System (GPS)-loggers and barometric pressure loggers to track the three-dimensional movements of northern gannets rearing chicks at a large colony in south-east Scotland (Bass Rock), located <50km from several major wind farm developments with recent planning consent. We estimated the foraging ranges and densities of birds at sea, their flight heights during different activities and the spatial variation in height during trips. We then used these data in collision-risk models to explore how the use of different methods to determine flight height affects the predicted risk of birds colliding with turbines. Gannets foraged in and around planned wind farm sites. The probability of flying at collision-risk height was low during commuting between colonies and foraging areas (median height 12m) but was greater during periods of active foraging (median height 27m), and we estimated that 1500 breeding adults from Bass Rock could be killed by collision with wind turbines at two planned sites in the Firth of Forth region each year. This is up to 12 times greater than the potential mortality predicted using other available flight-height estimates.Synthesis and applications. The use of conventional flight-height estimation techniques resulted in large underestimates of the numbers of birds at risk of colliding with wind turbines.

The characteristics of the wind resource mean that turbines are often prominently positioned within these landscapes.One way in which the visual impact of wind farms can be reduced is by positioning turbines in less exposed positions at a given site. This study explores the trade-off between visual impact and energy capture that this repositioning involves, using computer modelling techniques and a survey-based economic valuation method A modified layout was derived for an existing wind farm and a direct comparison made between the benefit of this alternative layout, in terms of a reduction in visual impact, and its associated cost, in terms of loss of power output.In this study, similar values were placed on both the aesthetic improvement and the reduction in energy capture associated with the repositioned turbines.

Modern wind turbines seem to reach high enough into the airspace to interfere with the migratory movements of insects. The hypothesis is consistent with recent observations of bats at wind turbines. It is supported by the observation that mortality of bats at wind turbines is highly seasonal (August-September) and typically peaks during nights with weather conditions known to trigger large-scale migratory movements of insects (and songbirds). We also discuss other current hypotheses concerning the mortality of bats at wind turbines.,,,,,,,,,66,0,0,0,57,0,75,,,1612-4642,1439-0574,,,,,,,,,,"Lund Univ, Dept Biol, S-22362 Lund, SwedenMuseum Hist Nat Bourges, Soc Etude & Protect Mammiferes, F-18000 Bourges, FranceInst Conservacao Nat & Biodiversidade, P-1150294 Lisbon, Portugal",Museum Hist Nat BourgesInst Conservacao Nat & Biodiversidade,,,2010-12-01,WOS:000284426300001,,

Most of the bats killed by turbines thus far have been migratory species that roost in trees throughout the year, and the highest fatality events appear to coincide with autumn migration. Hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) are highly migratory and one of the most frequently killed species at wind turbines. We analyzed a long-term data set to investigate how weather and moonlight influenced the occurrence of hoary bats at an island stopover point along their migration route. We then related our results to the problem of bat fatalities at wind turbines. We found that relatively low wind speeds, low moon illumination, and relatively high degrees of cloud cover were important predictors of bat arrivals and departures, and that low barometric pressure was an additional variable that helped predict arrivals. Slight differences in the conditions under which bats arrived and departed from the island suggest that hoary bats may be more likely to arrive on the island with passing storm fronts in autumn. These results also indicate that fatalities of hoary bats at wind turbines may be predictable events, that the species may be drawn to prominent landmarks that they see during migration, and that they regularly migrate over the ocean. Additional observations from this and other studies suggest that the problem of bat fatalities at wind turbines may be associated with flocking and autumn mating behaviors.

However, the high capital cost associated with floating wind development remains one of the primary hurdles in the industry's growth. In efforts to lower this cost, this paper investigates a novel shared anchor concept to reduce the total number of anchors and installations. Two different multiline geometries are studieda 3-line anchor system and a 6-line anchor system. Simulations of the anchor forces are generated using National Renewable Energy Laboratory's OC4-DeepCwind semisubmersible floating system and 5-MW wind turbine, and the anchor forces of the 2 different multiline geometries are compared to those of a conventional single-line anchor geometry. Multiline anchor net force is calculated by vector summing the contributing tensions of the lines connected to the anchor. Results show that the behavior of the multiline anchor net force is governed by the connected line contributing the largest tension. Mean and maximum anchor forces are decreased in the 3-line anchor system and increased in the 6-line anchor system, relative to the single-line system. The average direction of multiline anchor net force is aligned with environmental load direction, and a wider range of multiline anchor net force directions are exhibited for wave-dominated load cases. Direction reversal of the multiline anchor net force under constant wind, wave, and current direction is small and infrequent.

These loads are obtained by time-domain simulations of the coupled aero-servo-hydro-elastic model of the wind turbine. Accuracy of predicted loads depends on assumptions made in the simulation models employed, both for the turbine and for the input wind and wave conditions. Currently, waves are simulated using a linear irregular wave theory that is not appropriate for nonlinear waves, which are even more pronounced in shallow water depths where wind farms are typically sited. The present study investigates the use of irregular nonlinear (second-order) waves for estimating loads on the support structure (monopile) of an offshore wind turbine. We present the theory for the irregular nonlinear model and incorporate it in the commonly used wind turbine simulation software, FAST, which had been developed by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), but which had the modeling capability only for irregular linear waves. We use an efficient algorithm for computation of nonlinear wave elevation and kinematics, so that a large number of time-domain simulations, which are required for prediction of long-term loads using statistical extrapolation, can easily be performed. To illustrate the influence of the alternative wave models, we compute loads at the base of the monopile of the NREL 5MW baseline wind turbine model using linear and nonlinear irregular wave models. We show that for a given environmental condition (i.e., the mean wind speed and the significant wave height), extreme loads are larger when computed using the nonlinear wave model. We finally compute long-term loads, which are required for a design load case according to the International Electrotechnical Commission guidelines, using the inverse first-order reliability method. We discuss a convergence criteria that may be used to predict accurate 20-year loads and discuss wind versus wave dominance in the load prediction. We show that 20-year long-term loads can be significantly higher when the nonlinear wave model is used. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The LQ weighting matrices are selected using time series of the wind/wave disturbances generated for the relevant sea states. A linearized state-space model is developed, including the floater surge/pitch motions, rotor speed, collective blade pitch actuation, and unmeasured environmental disturbances. The wind disturbance modeling is based on the Kaimal spectrum and aerodynamic thrust/torque coefficients. The wave disturbance modeling is based on the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum and linearized Morison equation. A high-fidelity FOWT simulator is used to verify the control-oriented model.

The two types of offshore WPFs studied are small-scale WPFs close to the grid and medium-scale WPFs far from the grid.

To keep pace with current developments in wind turbine technology, the network design takes into account the extension of the LNs for both the wind turbine foundation and meteorological measurements.

Using importance sampling and a specially adapted two-stage filtering procedure, we obtain pseudo-optimal sets of load cases from which the fatigue damage is estimated. This is applied to seven different designs that have been modified to emulate iterations of an optimization loop. For several of these designs, sampling less than 1% of all load cases can give damage estimates with median errors of less than 2%.

Besides climatic conditions, the deployment of wind energy is limited by technical, social, economic, and environmental factors. Typically, assessments of land availability for wind power use legal and technical criteria to estimate the potential for wind power expansion. In contrast, we use observed characteristics of wind power generation sites existing in Austria and Denmark to estimate its potential expansion in Czechia. We combined data on wind turbine locations with data on land use, wind speeds, human impact on land, and nature conservation areas. Results Our analysis shows that the density of wind power in Austria is variable, but higher on average (4.79 MW km(-2)) than in Denmark (1.76 MW km(-2)). Austrian wind turbines have been installed in areas where the human impact on land is mostly higher than the Austrian average, while in Denmark, no difference is observed. Regarding the land use composite, the share of agricultural land on sites with wind turbines is on average much higher (86%), while the share of forest is much lower (7%) in both countries. We identified a maximum potential area in Czechia of 543 km(2) with Austrian and 421 km(2) with Danish characteristics. When conservatively assuming observed historical power densities, this area translates to 2295 MW and 741 MW of installed wind power capacity, respectively. These results are a magnitude of order lower than the potentials found in existing studies. In a sensitivity analysis, we have examined that the availability of potential sites depends mainly on the population density, the human impact on land, prevailing wind speeds, and the height above sea level. Conclusions We estimated available land area for potential wind turbine installations in Czechia using our newly developed methodology based on observed site characteristics of today's wind power infrastructure in Austria and Denmark. Available land area indicated possible overestimation of wind power capacities proposed in the recent studies on the renewable energy transition. Hence, more rigorous consideration of land availability is required for assessments of potential wind power expansion.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,0,13,,,2192-0567,,,,,,,,,,,"German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Engn Thermodynam, Dept Energy Syst Anal, Stuttgart, GermanyUniv Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Dev, Vienna, Austria",,,,2020-02-17,WOS:000511683100001,31894197,

Interest in the integration of control with system health monitoring has increased in recent years. The integration of a health management module with model predictive control (MPC) provides the wind turbine a mechanism to operate safely and optimize the trade-off between components' life and energy production. In this paper, a health-aware LPV model predictive control approach for wind turbines is proposed. The proposed controller establishes a trade-off between the economic objective based on maximizing the energy production but at the same time taking into account the minimization of accumulated stress on the wind turbine blades. The controller uses an LPV model for dealing with the non-linearity of the wind turbine model and the inclusion of the stress model. The proposed approach is tested on a well-known wind turbine case.

With increasing water depth, different substructures of the offshore wind turbine, such as the jacket and multipile, are the increasing focus of attention because they appear to be cost-effective. However, these substructures are still in the early stages of development in the offshore wind industry. The aim of the present study was to design a suitable substructure, such as a jacket or multipile, to support a 5 MW wind turbine in 33 m deep water for the Korean Southwest Offshore Wind Farm. This study also aimed to compare the dynamic responses of different substructures including the monopile, jacket and multipile and evaluate their feasibility. We therefore performed an eigenanalysis and a coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulation under deterministic and stochastic conditions in the environmental conditions in Korea. The results showed that the designed jacket and multipile substructures, together with the modified monopile, were well located at soft stiff intervals, where most modern utility-scale wind turbine support structures are designed. The dynamic responses of the different substructures showed that of the three substructures, the performance of the jacket was very good. In addition, considering the simple configuration of the multipile, which results in lower manufacturing cost, this substructure can provide another possible solution for Korean's first offshore wind farm. This study provides knowledge that can be applied for the deployment of large-scale offshore wind turbines in intermediate water depths in Korea. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Regarding to this, a global multi-direction A* algorithm is introduced. The algorithm is modified from three perspectives: (1) Artificial potential field (APF) is expressed in scalar mode instead of vector mode; (2) The moving distance in each step is adjusted based on the complexity of the around environment; (3) The penalty mode is proposed for the subsea pipelines. The scalar APF model avoids ships crossing between the two obstacles very close to each other, which is very important in dense wind turbine waters. The adjusted stepping mode can extend possible moving directions compared with conventional A* algorithm while making a trade-off between computation complexity and efficiency. The penalty model plays an effective role, so that the planned trajectory is crossing the pipelines only once. Simulation results indicate that the trajectory from 20-direction A* algorithm has similar path length with real cases while enhancing navigation safety to a large degree. Compared with the real-case trajectory, the minimum distance to the wind turbines has increased more than 3 times and the path length outside the wind farm decreased from more than 16000m to less than 11000m.",,,,,,,,,65,6,0,0,2,0,69,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Wuhan Univ Technol, Intelligent Transport Syst Res Ctr ITSC, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R ChinaNatl Engn Res Ctr Water Transport Safety WTSC, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R ChinaBeibu Gulf Univ, Maritime Coll, Qinzhou, Peoples R ChinaNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Fac Engn, Dept Marine Technol, Trondheim, Norway",,,,2019-09-09,WOS:000482523300026,,

The goal of this research is to evaluate the natural frequency and seismic behavior of offshore wind turbine with a monopod foundation considering SFSI. Scaled model of offshore wind turbine and monopod foundation is produced for this research. Geotechnical centrifuge tests in fixed-based and SFSI condition were performed to measure natural frequency in each case. Also, a series of seismic loadings with different intensities are applied to observe seismic behaviors of the offshore wind turbine during the earthquake and permanent changes after the earthquake. Experimental results show apparent natural frequency reduction in SFSI condition compared with the fixed-based condition, non-linear changes in dynamic response during a series of earthquakes and permanent changes occurred in natural frequency and rotational displacement after earthquakes.

In areas with sandy seabed conditions, erosion of sediment by the actions of wave and current can negatively influence foundation capacity. An accurate prediction model of scour around the piles is therefore required. Well-accepted scour prediction methods exist; both for the equilibrium scour depth and the time scale of scour [1] around single piles. These standard formulas have been combined with metocean data and a hindcasting model to calculate the expected scour depth around piles of wind turbine tripod foundations. Other causes of scour, such as pile-pile interaction, effect of proximity of structural members to the seabed, and seabed mobility were also assessed in order to determine the amount of global scour to be considered. The scour predictions were compared to measurements taken at an offshore wind turbine foundation at Park Alpha Ventus (PAV) in the German North Sea [2]. The data showed very good agreement with the measured scour around the piles. Both the equilibrium scour depth and time scale of scour were well predicted using the hindcasting model. The measured scour below the central column of the tripod structure exceeded expectations; this is believed to be due to a pumping effect during storm episodes. Finally, the effect of scour on the vertical effective stress around the tripod piles was assessed with a finite element model. Local scour had an important effect while scour below the centre of the structure had a much more limited effect. Considering the combined effects of multiple pile interaction, scour below the central column, and making an allowance for seabed mobility, an equivalent global scour depth for pile capacity calculations was established.",,,,,"32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 09-14, 2013JUN 09-14, 2013","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Nantes, FRANCENantes, FRANCE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5540-9,,,,,,,,,"Cathie Associates, Diegem, BelgiumAdv Geomech, Perth, WA, Australia",Cathie AssociatesAdv Geomech,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000360867600053,,

The experimental data consists of a set of 1174 load and stress time-series obtained from an offshore wind turbine prototype under power production conditions. Since our first interest is to characterise the effects of wind fluxes, a first prototype has been installed onshore in order to avoid the effects of marine currents in the study.Each time-series has a total duration of 10 minutes and has been acquired at a sampling frequency of 50Hz. Data has been classified in 13 groups corresponding to different wind conditions ranging from 3 to 15 m/s. For each time-series, we use different model-selection criteria (BIC, AIC, FPE) in order to select an optimal Autoregressive moving average model with exogenous inputs (ARMAX). The stationarity of the structural response of the system is then analysed by using a dynamical linear model in which latent variables correspond to the parameters of the selected ARMAX model.

A critical aspect of creating reliable, mature floating wind turbine technology is the development, verification, and validation of efficient computer-aided-engineering (CAE) tools. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has created FAST, a comprehensive, coupled analysis CAE tool for floating wind turbines, which has been verified and utilized in numerous floating wind turbine studies. Several efforts are underway to validate the floating platform functionality of FAST to complement its already validated aerodynamic and structural simulation capabilities. The research employs the 1/50th-scale DeepCwind wind/wave basin model test dataset, which was obtained at the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN) in 2011. This paper describes further work being undertaken to continue this validation. These efforts focus on FAST's ability to replicate global response behaviors associated with dynamic wind forces and second-order difference-frequency wave-diffraction forces separately and simultaneously.The first step is the construction of a FAST numerical model of the DeepCwind semi-submersible floating wind turbine that includes alterations for the addition of second-order difference-frequency wave-diffraction forces. The implementation of these second-order wave forces, which are not currently standard in FAST, are outlined and discussed. After construction of the FAST model, the calibration of the FAST model's wind turbine aerodynamics, tower-bending dynamics, and platform hydrodynamic damping using select test data is discussed. Subsequently, select cases with coupled dynamic wind and irregular wave loading are simulated in FAST, and these results are compared to test data. Particular attention is paid to global motion and load responses associated with the interaction of the wind and wave environmental loads. These loads are most prevalent in the vicinity of the rigid-body motion natural frequencies for the DeepCwind semi-submersible, with dynamic wind forces and the second-order difference-frequency wave-diffraction forces driving the global system response at these low frequencies. Studies are also performed to investigate the impact of neglecting the second-order wave forces on the predictive capabilities of the FAST model. The comparisons of the simulation and test results highlight the ability of FAST to accurately capture many of the important coupled global response behaviors of the DeepCwind semi-submersible floating wind turbine.",,,,,"32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 09-14, 2013JUN 09-14, 2013","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Nantes, FRANCENantes, FRANCE",49,2,0,0,0,0,50,,,,,978-0-7918-5542-3,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maine, Orono, ME 04469 USANatl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO USA",,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000360869000019,,

According to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) U.S. Wind Industry Report (AWEA, 2009) for year ending 2009, over 10 000 megawatts (MW) of wind was installed in 2009 for a total wind power capacity of 35 000 MW in the U.S. While the wind industry's current focus is on new generation installation and startup, future emphasis will be on long-term reliability and maintainability of wind energy assets. Failures of critical wind turbine components are occurring earlier than expected, resulting in increasing maintenance costs, unplanned outages and decreased capacity factors.Today's wind turbines of the 1.5 MW output class have blades that span approximately 50 to 70 m and up to 6 m in chord, the distance from the leading to trailing edges. Due to the large, complex surface area and access considerations, examination of these structures is challenging. Visual testing (VT) is the primary examination method used by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and maintenance service providers to examine wind turbine blades. While VT is limited to surface testing discontinuity detection, other nondestructive testing (NDT) methods are available for blade inspections, which may provide better information about the structural integrity of a blade.One NDT method that is capable of testing large component surfaces is laser shearography. Laser shearography has seen extensive use in aerospace and marine applications for the inspection of composite materials for detection of nonvisible surface and near-surface discontinuities.

In this paper, a validated CFD analysis tool FOWT-UALM-SJTU with modified actuator line model is applied for the coupled aero-hydrodynamic simulations of a spar-type FOWT system. The aero-hydrodynamic characteristics of the FOWT with various platform motion modes and different wind turbine states are compared and analyzed to explore the influence of the interference effects between the wind turbine and the floating platform on the performance of the FOWT. The dynamic responses of local relative wind speed and local attack angle at the blade section and wind-wave forces acting on the floating platform are discussed in detail to reveal the interaction mechanism between the aerodynamic loads and different DOF platform motions. It is shown that the surge motion and the pitch motion of the floating platform both significantly alter the local attack angle, while only the platform pitch motion have significant impacts on the local relative wind speed experienced by the rotating blades. Besides, the shaft tilt and the pro-cone angle of the wind turbine and the height-dependent wind speed all contribute to the variation of the local attack angle. The coupling between the platform motions along different DOFs is obviously amplified by the aerodynamic forces derived from the wind turbine. In addition, the wake deflection phenomenon is clearly observed in the near wake region when platform pitch motion is considered. The dynamic pitch motion of the floating platform also contributes to the severe wake velocity deficit and the increased wake width.",,,,,,,,,18,4,0,0,0,0,21,,,,2071-1050,,,,,,,,,,"Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Adv Ship & Deep Sea Explor, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",,,,2020-04-13,WOS:000521955600246,,

Compared with the traditional floating HAWTs, main advantages of floating VAWTs are the independence of wind direction and the lower position of power generating system, which reduce the installation and maintenance costs. Dynamical characteristics of floating VAWTs were widely studied in the preceding researches by tackling the wind turbine as a rigid body. However, the increasing size of wind turbine is beneficial to achieve higher cost performance. The elastic deformations of slender structures including blades and tower should be considered when the dynamical characteristics of the floating wind turbine are studied. In this paper, rigid-flexible coupling equations were established to investigate the dynamic behavior of H-type floating VAWT based on multi-body kinematics and dynamics. Natural motion performances of the wind turbine structures were presented and the phenomenon of dynamic stiffening was analyzed. Motions of the floater and vibrations of the tower and blades were computed under complex environmental loads. Time domain and frequency domain simulations were carried out to study the dynamic response of floater, tower and blades, respectively.

For the below-rated wind speed, when wake meandering was most extreme, yaw motion standard deviations for the downstream semi were approximately 40% greater in high turbulence and over 100% greater in low turbulence when compared with the upstream semi. The low yaw natural frequency (0.01 Hz) of the semi was excited by meandering, while quasi-static responses resulted in approximately 20% increases in yaw motion standard deviations for the spar and TLP. Differences in fatigue loading between the upstream and downstream turbines for the mooring line tension and tower base fore-aft bending moment mostly depended on the velocity deficit and were not directly affected by meandering. However, wake meandering did affect fatigue loading related to the tower top yaw moment and the blade root out-of-plane moment.",,,,,,,,,39,1,0,0,0,0,39,,,1095-4244,1099-1824,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USANorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Technol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2020-02-13,WOS:000513176100001,,

Previous works have not put attention to address the complexity of offshore loading combinations and as-constructed state of the structure in estimating structural responses for fatigue behaviour to stochastically predict the remaining fatigue life. The present paper links the oceanographic data to fatigue damage by using measured strain, and uses the Bayesian approach to update the joint distribution of the oceanographic data.

Soaring birds are among the most affected groups with alarming fatality rates by collision with wind turbines and an escalating occupation of their migratory corridors. These birds have been described as changing their flight trajectories to avoid wind turbines, but this behaviour may lead to functional habitat loss, as suitable soaring areas in the proximity of wind turbines will likely be underused. We modelled the displacement effect of wind turbines on black kites (Milvus migrans) tracked by GPS. We also evaluated the impact of this effect at the scale of the landscape by estimating how much suitable soaring area was lost to wind turbines. We used state-of-the-art tracking devices to monitor the movements of 130 black kites in an area populated by wind turbines, at the migratory bottleneck of the Strait of Gibraltar. Landscape use by birds was mapped from GPS data using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models, and generalized additive mixed modelling was used to estimate the effect of wind turbine proximity on bird use while accounting for orographic and thermal uplift availability. We found that areas up to approximately 674 m away from the turbines were less used than expected given their uplift potential. Within that distance threshold, bird use decreased with the proximity to wind turbines. We estimated that the footprint of wind turbines affected 3%-14% of the areas suitable for soaring in our study area. We present evidence that the impacts of wind energy industry on soaring birds are greater than previously acknowledged. In addition to the commonly reported fatalities, the avoidance of turbines by soaring birds causes habitat losses in their movement corridors. Authorities should recognize this further impact of wind energy production and establish new regulations that protect soaring habitat. We also showed that soaring habitat for birds can be modelled at a fine scale using publicly available data. Such an approach can be used to plan low-impact placement of turbines in new wind energy developments.",,,,,,,,,60,2,0,0,37,0,69,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, CE3c Ctr Ecol Evolucao & Alteracoes Ambientais, P-1749016 Lisbon, PortugalUniv Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Ecol Aplicada Prof Baeta Neves CEABN, InBio, Lisbon, PortugalUniv Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, REN Biodivers Chair, CIBIO InBio,Lab Associado, Vairao, PortugalMax Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Migrat & Immunoecol, Radolfzell am Bodensee, GermanyUniv Fed Para, Nucleo Teoria & Pesquisa Comportamento, Belem, Para, BrazilNorwegian Inst Nat Res, Trondheim, NorwayUniv Malaga, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, Biogeog Divers & Conservat Res Team, Malaga, SpainFdn Migres CIMA, Cadiz, SpainUniv Konstanz, Dept Biol, Constance, GermanyUniv Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBio,Lab Associado, Lisbon, Portugal",Fdn Migres CIMA,,,2020-01-01,WOS:000506707800010,30762229,

Tidal stream energy converters (turbines) are currently being installed in tidally energetic coastal sites. However, there is currently a high level of uncertainty surrounding the potential environmental impacts on marine mammals. This is a key consenting risk to commercial introduction of tidal energy technology. Concerns derive primarily from the potential for injury to marine mammals through collisions with moving components of turbines. To understand the nature of this risk, information on how animals respond to tidal turbines is urgently required. 2. We measured the behaviour of harbour seals in response to acoustic playbacks of simulated tidal turbine sound within a narrow coastal channel subject to strong, tidally induced currents. This was carried out using data from animal-borne GPS tags and shore-based observations, which were analysed to quantify behavioural responses to the turbine sound. 3. Results showed that the playback state (silent control or turbine signal) was not a significant predictor of the overall number of seals sighted within the channel. 4. However, there was a localised impact of the turbine signal; tagged harbour seals exhibited significant spatial avoidance of the sound which resulted in a reduction in the usage by seals of between 11 and 41% at the playback location. The significant decline in usage extended to 500 m from the playback location at which usage decreased by between 1 and 9% during playback. 5. Synthesis and applications: This study provides important information for policy makers looking to assess the potential impacts of tidal turbines and advise on development of the tidal energy industry. Results showing that seals avoid tidal turbine sound suggest that a proportion of seals encountering tidal turbines will exhibit behavioural responses resulting in avoidance of physical injury; in practice, the empirical changes in usage can be used directly as avoidance rates when using collision risk models to predict the effects of tidal turbines on seals. There is now a clear need to measure how marine mammals behave in response to actual operating tidal turbines in the long term to learn whether marine mammals and tidal turbines can co-exist safely at the scales currently envisaged for the industry.

The main idea is to improve fault identification accuracy and facilitate the probabilistic sorting of possible faults with critical variables so as to provide abundant and reliable reference information for maintenance personnel. In the stage of state rule mining, representative initial rules are generated via the combination of a clustering algorithm and heuristic learning. Then, a multi-population quantum evolutionary algorithm is utilized to optimize the rule base. In the stage of fault identification, abnormal states are identified via a fuzzy rule-based classification system, and probabilistic fault sorting with critical variables is realized according to the fuzzy reasoning of state rules. Ten common sensor and actuator faults in 5 MW offshore WTs are taken to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has higher identification accuracy than other identification methods and thus prove the feasibility of the proposed probabilistic fault analysis scheme.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,,"Shenyang Univ Technol, Sch Elect Engn, Shenyang 110870, Liaoning, Peoples R China",,,,2019-07-09,WOS:000472635900013,,

In this approach, each wind turbine is considered to be an intelligent agent. The turbine at the farm boundary communicates with its neighbouring downwind turbines and organizes them adaptively into a wind delivery group along the wind direction. The agent attributes and the event structure are designed on the basis of the intelligent agent theory by using the unified modelling language. The control strategy of the intelligent agent is studied using topology models. The reference power of an individual wind turbine from the wind farm controller is re-dispatched to balance the turbine fatigue in the power dispatch intervals. In the fatigue optimization, the goal function is to minimize the standard deviation of the fatigue coefficient for every wind turbine. The optimization is constrained such that the average fatigue for every turbine is smaller than what would be achieved by conventional dispatch and such that the total power loss of the wind farm is restricted to a few percent of the total power. This intelligent agent control approach is verified through the simulation of wind data from the Horns Rev offshore wind farm. The results illustrate that intelligent agent control is a feasible way to optimize fatigue distribution in wind farms, which may reduce the maintenance frequency and extend the service life of large-scale wind farms.

In this study, the potential of alleviating blade load variations induced by the cyclic pitch control evaluated under the condition of the diagonal inflow wind. An experiment in an open wind tunnel was performed to investigate the effect of the diagonal inflow wind on the aerodynamic forces of FOWTs.

Energy from the offshore wind can be potential source of renewable energy which is capable of meeting our needs. Research is still underway for addressing the several challenges associated with this technology and one of them is the unwanted response of support structures for wind turbines. Offshore wind turbines are located in severe environment and experience environmental loads like wind, wave, current and seismic excitations. The support structures when subjected to the loads exhibit the nonlinear response. Owing to the irregular waves, the response will often he chaotic which in turn reduces the overall stability of the turbine. A 5MW NREL wind turbine is considered for the study. The turbine is assumed to be installed on a floating platform with water depths of 320 m. To keep the response in safe operating regime, the controlled response of offshore structure is essential. The focus of this paper is to develop robust control techniques so as to regulate the vibration and synchronization of support structures for an offshore wind turbine. To achieve the same, two methods the sliding mode controller and a control mechanism based on altering the oscillation energy are being proposed. The performance of the algorithms is illustrated in this paper by designing the controllers for controlled response of the structures supporting offshore wind turbines in the chaotic regime. The performances of controllers are compared with general back steeping control methodology based on Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical results and simulations are shown to validate the proposed methodology and to demonstrate its effectiveness.",,,,,1st International Conference on Non Conventional Energy (ICONCE)1st International Conference on Non Conventional Energy (ICONCE),"JAN 16-17, 2014JAN 16-17, 2014","Tech Educ Qual Improvement Program; IEEE Kolkata Sect; IEEE Power & Energy Soc, Kolkata Chapter; JIS GrpTech Educ Qual Improvement Program; IEEE Kolkata Sect; IEEE Power & Energy Soc, Kolkata Chapter; JIS Grp","JIS Coll Engn, Kalyani, INDIAJIS Coll Engn, Kalyani, INDIA",4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,,,978-1-4799-3339-6,,,,,,,,,"Indian Inst Technol, Dept Ocean Engn, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India",,,,2015-04-29,WOS:000352002000036,,

In order for such structures to make worthwhile investments, they need to be in operation for 20-30 years after installation. The wind turbine and the foundation are subject to fatigue damage from environmental loading (wind, waves) as well as from cyclic loading imposed through the rotational frequency (1P) through mass and aerodynamic imbalances and from the blade passing frequency (3P) of the wind turbine. Through dynamic amplification and resonance, the fatigue damage suffered by the structure can severely increase if the natural frequency of the wind turbine gets close to the frequency of excitation, thereby reducing the service lifetime of the OWT. Therefore, predicting the first natural frequency is of paramount importance. In this paper a mechanical and mathematical model is presented, which provides a good initial estimate of the natural frequency of OWTs for conceptual design. The soil-structure interaction (SSI) is modelled through a set of springs, which also includes the cross-coupling between the lateral and rotational stiffness of the foundation. Approximate analytical formulae are given to approximate the natural frequency. The results are compared to measured data as well as results from similar software.

The prototype, called VolturnUS 1:8, was installed off Castine, Maine, USA. The prototype is a 1:8 scale prototype and serves to de-risk the deployment of a full-scale 6MW turbine. VolturnUS utilizes innovations in materials, construction, and deployment technologies such as a concrete semi-submersible hull and an advanced composite tower to reduce the costs of offshore wind. The prototype unit was designed following the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Guide for Building and Classing Floating Offshore Wind Turbine Installations. Froude scaling was used in designing the 1:8-scale VolturnUS prototype so that the motions of the prototype in the relatively protected site represent those of the full-scale unit in an open site farther offshore. During the past year, a comprehensive instrumentation package monitored key performance characteristics of the platform during operational, extreme, and survival storm conditions. Data collected include: wind speed, turbine power, rotor angular frequency, blade pitch, torque, acceleration; tower bending moment, 6 DOF accelerations at tower top and base, mooring line tensions, and wave elevation at the platform. During the past year the prototype has experienced many environments representative of scaled ABS design conditions including operational wind and sea-states, 50-year sea states and 500-year survival sea states. This large data set provides a unique view of a near full-scale floating wind turbine subjected to its prescribed environmental conditions.

Of these, modelling of foundation flexibility has been given little priority. This paper investigates the modelling of bottom-fixed OWTs in the non-linear aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulation tool FAST v7. The OWTs considered is supported on a monopile. The objective of this paper was to implement a non-linear foundation model in this software. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's idealized 5MW reference turbine was used as a base for the analyses. Default modelling of foundation in FAST v7 is by means of a rigid foundation. This implies that soil stiffness and damping is disregarded. Damping may lead to lower design loads. A softer foundation, on the other hand, will increase the natural periods of the system, shifting them closer to the frequencies of the environmental loads. This may in turn lead to amplified moments at the mudline. Therefore, it is important to include soil stiffness and damping in analyses. In this paper, a non-linear foundation model is introduced in FAST v7 by means of uncoupled parallel springs. To verify that the implementation is successful, non-linear load-displacement curves of the foundation spring are presented. These show the typical hysteresis loops of an inelastic material, which confirms the implementation.

The two main issues regarding offshore wind farms and birds are disturbance and collision risk. We studied the effect of wind turbines on the flight behaviour of wintering common eiders Somateria mollissima in order to identify the properties that cause disturbance and the factors that may increase their risk of collision.2. The study was conducted at Tuno Knob offshore wind park in the Kattegat, Denmark. We attracted birds though the use of decoys located at increasing distances from the wind park. To discriminate between the potential disturbance effect of the standing towers from that of the revolving rotor blades, wind turbines were switched on or off alternately during 10 experimental trials.3. Common eiders reacted strongly to the presence of wind turbines. The number of flying birds was significantly related to flight corridor location and position of the decoy group. That behavioural reaction was interpreted to be a consequence of their high speed and low-manoeuvrability flight occurring within the vertical height range of the wind turbines. The number of landing birds also reacted to the position of the decoy group in relation to proximity to the turbines, with the greatest effects observed within the wind park. Such avoidance behaviour might decrease use of otherwise suitable habitat.4. The movement and noise of rotors affected neither the number of common eiders flying within corridors nor the number of birds reacting to decoys. This suggests that the avoidance behaviour observed was caused by the presence of the structures themselves and that eiders use vision when avoiding human-made structures.5. Synthesis and applications. This study has demonstrated that common eiders avoid flying close to or into the Tuno Knob wind park. This behaviour may result in a reduction in habitat availability within and around wind parks, and raises concerns about the possible impact of the extensive development of large-scale wind parks in shallow offshore waters, which are the main feeding areas for sea ducks and other marine birds. Our results indicate that the disturbance effect of revolving rotor blades is negligible during daylight hours but highlights the need for studies to be carried out during hours of darkness and conditions of poor visibility (e.g. fog and snow).

Due to the varying environmental conditions, the effect of various uncertain parameters has to be studied to provide meaningful conclusions. Incorporating such uncertain parameters in this regard is often done by applying binning, where the probability density function under consideration is binned and in each bin random simulations are run to estimate the loads. A different methodology for quantifying uncertainties proposed in this work is polynomial interpolation, a more efficient technique that allows to more accurately predict the loads on the turbine for specific load cases. This efficiency is demonstrated by applying the technique to a power production test problem and to IEC Design Load Case 1.1, where the ultimate loads are determined using BLADED.

The growing size of these structures' dimensions, inducing very large mooring forces, makes the anchoring solution adopted a critical issue for the commercial success of floating marine energy farms.The upscaling of the screw anchor technology from onshore to the offshore environment has been recently proposed as an efficient way of providing a large tension capacity while their installation generates far less noise and vibrations than impact pile driving. Most of recent studies on screw anchors have focused on separated geotechnical problems such as their uplift capacity or installation requirements. This paper incorporates within a single procedure geotechnical and structural constraints to calculate the optimal anchor geometry able to maximise the uplift capacity available.Performance envelopes for screw anchors have been derived in a parametric study, covering a broad range of soil conditions as well as in a case study, representative of offshore conditions. Results show that single screw anchors are more efficient (e.g. shorter and lighter) than driven piles to sustain tension loading. The results presented in this study support the applicability of screw anchors to be used as part of the mooring system for wave energy converters.

Fish will be housed within a jacket foundation that is covered by fishnets. This new Jacket-Cage concept has two promising potential applications. First, the Jacket-Cage, utilizing the strong jacket foundation of wind turbines, has potential for operation under harsh offshore conditions. It requires no extra seabed footprint and no mooring systems. Due to the dual-use, the cost of the Jacket-Cage has potential to be competitive with the conventional fish cage. This study case demonstrates that the fish farming within the offshore wind farm could provide an important revenue stream for the offshore wind farm, e.g. the annual yield from the co-use increases by 44% compared to the pure offshore wind farm. The operation and maintenance of the fish farming by using Jacket-Cage has the potential to use the existing facilities from the offshore wind farm and to create new effective aquaculture functionality. The proposed installation procedures reveal no additional time and no special bottlenecks in its installation compared to the installation of the jacket foundation. The risks of the dual-use of the foundation of the wind turbine are indicated and the further investigations, including the important additional loads from the attached fishnets, are recommended.

For example, the energy demand for populated coastal cities encourages offshore farms to fulfill future electrical needs. Similarly, wind turbines may be placed in land-locked regions and power transmitted through electric grids to population centers. Most wind models available to engineers offer superb capabilities for predicting wind velocities on land and far offshore (5 km and greater).

With the increasing capacity and offshore distance, the impact of power losses in the cables on the economic performance of the wind farm becomes significant. Therefore, both the investment on the cables and the cost from the associated energy loss need to be considered in the optimization model. In this work, a detailed power loss cost model accounting for the wake effect's impact on the wind turbine output is proposed. The cable cost and the associated power losses cost are considered in the objective function. The offshore substation location, cable connection layout, and cable sectional area are optimized simultaneously while ensuring an uncrossed cable connection layout via a line segment intersection detection algorithm. Due to the non-convexity of the optimization model, an adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted. The proposed method was validated through a case of a real offshore wind farm, where the simulation results show that the cable connection layout formulation and sectional area selection varies significantly when different power loss model is applied. A 3.14% total cost reduction can be achieved by using the proposed method compared with the case without the power loss model.",,,,,,,,,29,2,0,0,1,0,32,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, Lyngby, DenmarkUniv Elect Sci & Technol China, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaHlth Data Insight, Cambridge, EnglandAalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark",Hlth Data Insight,,,2019-12-06,WOS:000497974600108,,

Installing modern wind turbines in offshore harsh environments or seismic prone areas can cause an increment in the probability of failure due to excessive vibrations. The current study evaluates the performance of onshore and offshore wind turbines under multihazard loads, including wind, wave, earthquake, and mass and aerodynamic imbalances for both parked and operating conditions. The Lagrangian approach is employed to model the wind turbine considering the blade/tower coupling. In order to lessen the vibrations induced by multihazard loads, external smart dampers are used and a novel energy-based probabilistic approach is employed to tune the semiactive controllers.

These foundations are complex structures consisting of steel and a high strength cementitious grout that fills the annulus between the two concentric steel pipes known as monopile and transition piece. The grouted connection is potentially prone to structural failures when subjected to harsh offshore conditions due to combinations of extreme wind and wave excitations. Already grouting failures related to slippage of the transition piece relative to the monopile due to weakening of the adhesion between the grout and the steel have been observed at several windfarms during the construction phase. Therefore, a thorough investigation of the grouted connection is of utmost importance. In this study, a large population of cementitious cores were sampled from as many as four offshore wind turbines. The samples were subjected to Ultrasonic Pulse velocity (UPV) non-destructive testing (NDT) and compression testing while a smaller set of samples was subjected to X-ray analysis as well. This paper presents the results of the combined use of the UPV and X-ray techniques as well as correlations with compressive strength results and critically discusses the possibility of using the techniques for in situ application. To the authors' knowledge it is the first time that these techniques are applied for assessment of the grouted connection of offshore wind turbines on monopile foundations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The phenomenon is characterised by increasing fatigue loads compared to the fore-aft fatigue and a small amount of system damping since almost no aerodynamic damping from the blades takes place. In addition, modern offshore wind turbines are flexible structures with resonance frequencies close to environmental loads and turbine blades passing the tower. Therefore, in order to avoid conservatism leading to additional costs during the load calculation and the design phase, the structural response must be analysed using reliable estimations of the dynamic properties of the wind turbines. Based on a thorough investigation of rotor-stop tests performed on offshore wind turbines supported by a monopile foundation for different wind parks in the period 2006-2011, the paper evaluates the first natural frequency and modal damping of the structures. In addition, fitting of theoretical energy spectra to measured response spectra of operating turbines is presented as an alternative method of determining the system damping. Analyses show distinctly time-dependent cross-wind dynamic properties. Based on numerical analysis, the variation is believed to be caused by sediment transportation at seabed level and varying performance of tower oscillation dampers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Most estimates have implicitly assumed that extraction of wind energy does not alter large-scale winds enough to significantly limit wind power production. Estimates that ignore the effect of wind turbine drag on local winds have assumed that wind power production of 2-4 W m(-2) can be sustained over large areas. New results from a mesoscale model suggest that wind power production is limited to about 1 W m(-2) at wind farm scales larger than about 100 km(2). We find that the mesoscale model results are quantitatively consistent with results from global models that simulated the climate response to much larger wind power capacities. Wind resource estimates that ignore the effect of wind turbines in slowing large-scale winds may therefore substantially overestimate the wind power resource.,,,,,,,,,74,2,0,0,8,0,88,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USAHarvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,,2013-05-15,WOS:000316998300084,,

Various wind parks are already producing energy and there are many more planned or currently being built. The maintenance of these offshore wind turbines is challenging due to the limited accessibility and expensive logistics. Currently, 25% of these structures have to be evaluated each year regarding their condition and stability. For this task, welded seams are the focus of interest. At the moment, they are visually inspected by divers; in the oil and gas industry, the alternating current field measurement (ACFM) technique is used as well. None of these are applicable on the inside of jackets, for example, due to safety issues. Visible inspection is often limited by the sight conditions and ACFM can only measure directly under the sensor. The Fraunhofer IKTS has therefore developed a transducer ring to be placed permanently on the foundations of offshore wind turbines. It is particularly well suited for the monitoring of jackets. The measurement device, CoMoSeam, has been successfully tested underwater. Furthermore, an artificially-initialised crack could be detected and located correctly. The investigation is realised by guided waves, which have a lower frequency range than the commonly used ultrasound techniques. The advantage lies in the reduced number of sensors compared to NDT ultrasound techniques, which also leads to a lower resolution. Nevertheless, the resolution is decreased but is still far better than that achieved by the currently used inspection methods. This paper presents the hardware used for building the sensor ring as well as the measurement technique. The lamination required to ensure that the equipment is waterproof is especially challenging due to the large diameters demanded for offshore platforms. To detect cracks correctly, even in harsh environments, sophisticated data processing is necessary to automatically eliminate all obviously incorrect data.

Birds colliding with wind turbines are generally perceived as one of the major conflict issues for wind-energy development. Development of effective and practical measures to reduce bird mortality related to offshore and onshore wind energy is therefore paramount to avoid any delay in consenting processes. The expected efficacy of post-construction mitigation measures for wind-turbine induced avian mortality can be expected to be species-specific with regard to audible, optical and biomechanical constraints and options. Species-specific sensory faculties limit the ability to observe a wind turbine in a given circumstance. Their consequent cognitive perception may depend on the possibilities for associating wind turbines with risk, and discriminating these from other sources. Last but not least, perceived risks may only be evaded when their aerodynamic, locomotive physiology enables them to do so in due time. In order to be able to identify and construe functional mitigation measures these aspects need to be taken into account. Measures eliciting a series of intermittent strong stimuli that are variable in frequency may limit habituation effects; these should only be elicited specifically to mitigate imminent collision. Thus measures either adjusting turbine operation or warning/deterring birds approaching turbines are expected to be most functional. Warning signals may either be based on optical or audible stimuli; however, birds' hearing is inferior to humans while their visual acuity and temporal resolution is higher, but with great differences among species. Implementing effective mitigation measures could reduce the general level of conflicts with birdlife and thus enable both the development at new sites, at sites that have been declared having too high conflict levels, and utilise the wind resources better at specific sites without increasing the conflict levels.

Results show that the developed FBG-FORJ system performs well to capture the FWT blade loads while not smearing other FWT dynamics. The FWT blade loading is determined by gravity, centrifugal force, aerodynamic loads, as well as wave and current excitations. The driving wind takes the lead in the FWT blade loads. An increased driving wind corresponds to increased blade loads in magnitude and fluctuation, as well as increased nP (n times per revolution) harmonics. The incident wave generates considerable responses at the wave frequency and introduces more loading fluctuations. The current tends to eliminate the floater inclination generated by the driving wind and subsequently mitigates the unsteady blade loading, despite the increased floater sway and roll fluctuations.
