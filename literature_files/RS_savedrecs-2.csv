Odontocetes, depending on emission and reception of sound for foraging, spatial orientation and social interactions, are likely to be impacted most. In Belgian and adjacent waters, specific concerns exist about the impact of underwater sound generated during pile driving on the harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena, the most common cetacean in these waters. The results of visual aerial line-transect surveys performed before and during pile driving at the Thorntonbank (Belgian waters, North Sea) suggested a displacement of porpoises to a distance of around 20 km from the piling location. Such an apparent large-scale avoidance reaction is similar to the one observed in other countries' waters in the North Sea. Using survey data, we developed a simple numerical model that could reproduce the harbour porpoises' redistribution pattern during disturbance. The further development of our initial model can be useful to predict or simulate the redistribution of harbour porpoises in cases when field investigations are not possible or impractical, for pre-construction environmental impact assessments and for impact assessments in case of multiple piling operations ongoing in the same area.",,,,,International Scientific WinMon.BE 2013 Conference on Environmental Impacts of Offshore Wind FarmsInternational Scientific WinMon.BE 2013 Conference on Environmental Impacts of Offshore Wind Farms,"NOV 26-28, 2013NOV 26-28, 2013",,"Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Brussels, BELGIUMRoyal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Brussels, BELGIUM",18,0,0,0,16,0,18,,,0018-8158,1573-5117,,,,,,,,,,"Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Operat Directorate Nat Environm, Marine Ecol & Management, Oostende, BelgiumRoyal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Operat Directorate Nat Environm, Marine Ecol & Management, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium",,,,2015-07-08,WOS:000356454000009,,

Although an increasingly detailed picture is emerging of these submerged palaeolandscapes, well-dated palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from the North Sea Basin remain few and far between. Pollen, foraminifera, ostracod, plant macrofossil and molluscan data are presented from a radiocarbon-dated core retrieved from the site of the Dudgeon offshore wind farm, located in the southern North Sea Basin. The palaeoenvironmental analysis provides new data on changing local physical and vegetation environments in the southern North Sea Basin, occurring against a background of global climate change and rising sea levels. Subalpine plant communities gradually gave way to hazel-dominated woodland during the early Holocene, with freshwater environments replaced by increasing signs of estuarine influence from ca. 9500 to 9000 cal a BP. The thin upper peat (8411-8331 cal a BP) raises the possibility that the final inundation of the Dudgeon site may be linked to meltwater pulses following the collapse of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the draining of the proglacial Lakes Agassiz and Ojibway.

Here, we analysed the stable isotope signals (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of the faunal communities associated with a wind turbine, its scour protection layer (SPL) and the surrounding soft sediments. We hypothesised that structural differences in community composition would be reflected in food web complexity and that resource partitioning could be one of the mechanisms contributing to the co-existence of such dense communities. Sampling was conducted at a gravity-based foundation in the Belgian part of the North Sea, where both sessile and mobile organisms were collected along the depth gradient of the turbine, the SPL and the surrounding soft substrate. The results indicated that the structural differences of the communities are reflected in the food web complexity as indicated by the trophic niche size, the trophic diversity and the redundancy of the communities along the depth gradient. Higher food web complexity was associated with zones where high accumulation of organic matter occurs (soft substrate and SPL). Low food web complexity was observed in depth zones that are dominated by sessile suspension-feeding organisms (intertidal and Mytilus zone). The high tmphic diversity and low redundancy observed within the trophic clusters of the soft substrate and the Metridium zone indicated that resource partitioning can be a mechanism allowing the co-existence of large densities of a wide variety of species.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,15,0,21,,,0141-1136,1879-0291,,,,,,,,,,"Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Marine Ecol & Management, Operat Directorate Nat Environm, Vautierstr 29, B-1000 Brussels, BelgiumUniv Ghent, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Res Grp, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",,,,2020-05-11,WOS:000528613500005,32275504,

Given the considerable growth of renewable energies and thus offshore wind farms in Germany over the last decade, increasing levels of aluminum, indium and zinc are released to the marine environment. Although these metals are ecotoxicologically well-studied, data regarding their impact on marine organisms, especially sediment-dwelling species, as well as possible ecotoxicological effects of galvanic anodes are scarce. To investigate possible ecotoxicological effects to the marine environment, the diatom Phaedactylum tricornutum, the bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri and the amphipod Corophium volutator were exposed to dissolved galvanic anodes and solutions of aluminum and zinc, respectively, in standardized laboratory tests using natural seawater. In addition to acute toxicological effects, the uptake of these elements by C. volutator was investigated. Results The investigated anode material caused no acute toxicity to the tested bacteria and only weak but significant effects on algal growth. In case of the amphipods, the single elements Al and Zn showed significant effects only at the highest tested concentrations. Moreover, an accumulation of Al and In was observed in the crustacea species. Conclusions Overall, the findings of this study indicated no direct environmental impact on the tested marine organisms by the use of galvanic anodes for cathodic protection. However, the accumulation of metals in, e.g., crustaceans might enhance their trophic transfer within the marine food web.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,0,10,,,2190-4707,2190-4715,,,,,,,,,,"Fed Inst Hydrol, Dept Biochem G3, Ecotoxicol, Mainzer Tor 1, D-56068 Koblenz, GermanyFed Inst Hydrol, Dept Aquat Chem G2, Mainzer Tor 1, D-56068 Koblenz, GermanyFed Waterways Engn & Res Inst, Sect Steel Struct & Corros Protect B2, Kussmaulstr 17, D-76187 Karlsruhe, GermanyFed Inst Mat Res & Testing, Div Inorgan Trace Anal 1 1, Richard Willstatter Str 11, D-12489 Berlin, Germany",Fed Inst HydrolFed Inst HydrolFed Waterways Engn & Res Inst,,,2020-12-01,WOS:000598776800001,,

Many platforms have large piles of cuttings lying beneath them and these probably present the greatest potential hazard to the environment during platform decommissioning and removal. There is, however, a lack of consensus on which aspects of drill cuttings are responsible for the adverse ecological effects. This hinders risk assessment of management options. Here we report data on the toxicity of sediments from around the North West Hutton platform to the amphipod Corophium volutator, the polychaete Arenicola marina and the Microtox (R), acute test system. Sediment was acutely toxic to Corophium out as far as 600 m from the platform. Sediment from 100 in from the platform remained acutely toxic to Corophium when 3% contaminated sediment was mixed with clean sediment. A 10% dilution of this sediment also inhibited Arenicola feeding almost completely. Sediment elutriates did not inhibit Microtox light output, but organics extracted by dichloromethane were very toxic. Fifteen minute EC50 values were as low as 0.25 mg ml(-1) and were strongly correlated with hydrocarbon concentrations. Metal concentrations in whole sediments were correlated with their toxicity to Corophium but the relationship was much weaker when data on dilutions were included. Except at sites immediately adjacent to the platform, metal concentrations were well below ERL values from the literature, so were too low to explain sediment toxicity. Toxicity of sediments to Corophium was closely correlated with their hydrocarbon content, even when tests on dilutions were included in the analysis. We conclude that hydrocarbons are the most significant cause of toxicity in these sediments contaminated with oil based drill cuttings and that polar organics, sulphide, ammonia and other water soluble substances are of much lower significance. Applying OSPAR guidelines to our data on the toxicity of cuttings pile material to Corophium data would give a maximum allowable concentration of 0.03% in clean sediments. The Microtox data indicate that sediments from deeper in the pile would require an even greater dilution than this. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Within a comprehensive study for the evaluation of offshore wind farms bird calls were registered automatically on a research platform in the south-eastern North Sea. The species identification of nocturnally migrating birds is almost exclusively possible only by means of their calls. Here, we present species-specific bird occurrence near an anthropogenic offshore structure in the total daily and yearly course on the basis of automatically registered calls.From 2004 to 2007, a total of 100 species was identified. Calls from 95,318 individuals (excluding the large gulls) were used for analyses. Three quarters were passerines (predominantly thrushes), furthermore mainly waders, terns and smaller gulls were detected. 79.4% of all individuals were registered during the night. High numbers of individuals, mostly of several species occurring together, were concentrated in only a few days/nights or even hours. Bird occurrence was much higher during autumn migration than during spring migration. A maximum of 5,236 birds of different species (corresponding to 392 Ind./h) was identified in the night from 28th to 29th October 2005. The migration periods of the short-/medium distance migrants were clearly distinguishable, otherwise not those of the long-distance passerine migrants, presumably due to their much minor ambition to call. In July mainly smaller gulls and terns, in August above all terns and waders (especially Redshank) and in winter some late smaller gulls and thrushes were registered. Generally, numbers increased continually with the beginning of the night and reached a maximum before sunrise. The fewest birds were detected in the late afternoon.Despite methodological constraints, the shown species-specific phenologies broadly match the migration times in the offshore area of the German Bight as recovered by trapping and/or by scheduled or coincidental visual observations of bird migration. Like these methods the acoustic recording cannot cover the whole occurrence of birds. Presumably, the number of birds is underestimated during fine and overestimated during adverse weather when birds reduce flight altitude. However, we assume that the birds registered acoustically on the platform reflect at least the low flying proportion of the calling species in the course of the year and in their daily variability.The opportunity to estimate numbers of low and thereby close to an anthropogenic obstruction flying birds using calls is - with regard to the evaluation of its collision risk and the introduction of mitigation and avoidance measures (site, short-term shutdown of the construction and optimization of illumination) - not exiguous.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,5,0,6,,,0049-6650,0049-6650,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Vogelforsch Vogelwarte Helgoland, Vogelwarte 21, D-26386 Wilhelmshaven, Germany",,,,2012-07-27,BCI:BCI201200538775,,

It is therefore important to explore opportunities that could support the co-existence of offshore wind farms (OWFs) and fishing activity. In addition to ecological evidence on the effects of OWFs on commercially exploited species, the co-location issue requires understanding of the perceptions of fishers and OWF developers on key constraints and opportunities. Interviews were carried out in 2013 with 67 fishers in South Wales and Eastern England and with 11 developers from major energy companies, to discover experiences and opinions on the co-location of OWFs with crab and lobster fisheries. Developers expressed broad support for co-location, perceiving potential benefits to their relationship with fishers and their wider reputation. Fishers had more mixed opinions, with geographical variation, and exhibited a range of risk perception. The lack of reported experience of potting within OWFs was not related to stock concerns but to uncertainty around safety, gear retrieval, insurance and liability. Clear protocols and communication to address these issues are essential if co-location is to be feasible. Scale may also limit the potential benefits to fishers, especially in that large offshore OWFs are likely to be inaccessible to much of the inshore fleet. There remains the potential to enhance the artificial reef effects of OWFs by deploying additional material between the turbines, but options to finance such schemes, and how investment by OWF developers could be offset against compensation paid to displaced fishers, require further investigation.

The rate of electricity generation in large wind farms containing multiple wind arrays is, therefore, constrained by the rate of kinetic energy replenishment from the atmosphere above. In recent years, a growing body of research argues that the rate of generated power is limited to around 1.5 W m(-2) within large wind farms. However, in this study, we show that considerably higher power generation rates may be sustainable over some open ocean areas. In particular, the North Atlantic is identified as a region where the downward transport of kinetic energy may sustain extraction rates of 6 W m(-2) and above over large areas in the annual mean. Furthermore, our results indicate that the surface heat flux from the oceans to the atmosphere may play an important role in creating regions where sustained high rates of downward transport of kinetic energy and thus, high rates of kinetic energy extraction may be geophysical possible.

However, the performance assessment of offshore wind turbine (OWT) structure is a challenging task due to the combined wind-wave loading and difficulties in reproducing such loading conditions in laboratory. Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS), combining physical testing and numerical simulation in real-time, offers a new venue to study the structural behavior of OWTs. It overcomes the scaling incompatibilities in OWT scaled model testing by replacing the rotor components with an actuation system, driven by an aerodynamic simulation tool running in real-time. In this study, a RTHS framework for monopile OWTs is proposed. A set of sensitivity analyses is carried out to evaluate the feasibility of this RTHS framework and determine possible tolerances on its design. By simulating different scaling laws and possible error contributors (delays and noises) in the proposed framework, the sensitivity of the OWT responses to these parameters are quantified. An example using a National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) 5-MW reference OWT system at 1:25 scale is simulated in this study to demonstrate the proposed RTHS framework and sensitivity analyses. Three different scaling laws are considered. The sensitivity results show that the delays in the RTHS framework significantly impact the performance on the response evaluation, higher than the impact of noises. The proposed framework and sensitivity analyses presented in this study provides important information for future implementation and further development of the RTHS technology for similar marine structures.

However, as industry moves towards using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), it is important to understand how such a change may affect assessments of fish assemblages and whether these data collected from AUVs can be directly compared to those collected from historic and future ROV footage. In an extremely rare opportunity, we compare fish assemblages surveyed by an industrial ROV and an industrial hybrid-AUV (H-AUV) along the same 2,060-m section of subsea pipeline, at the same time of day, within 1 day of each other. A total of 206 transects, each 20 m in length, were analyzed, recording 406 fish from 10 species. The H-AUV recorded all 10 fish species, while the ROV recorded seven. Mean species richness was similar to 4% higher for H-AUV, and mean abundance was similar to 21% higher for ROV; these differences can be considered negligible. Multivariate analysis revealed nonsignificant differences in species composition between survey methods. This result suggests that future surveys of fish at this pipeline using a similar H-AUV can yield comparable results to ROV and, as such, facilitate comparison to historical ROV imagery. Future surveys of pipelines with AUV should consider adding extra lighting and high-definition cameras onto booms similar to those operating on ROVs, which will provide a useful field of view into pipeline spans and make it easier to identify fish.

Moreover, the leading technological solutions to achieve this are offshore wind turbines. As installed capacity has been increasing rapidly and shallow water near shore sites are exhausted, projects will need to be developed further from shore and often in deeper waters, which will pose greater technical challenges and constrain efforts to reduce costs.Current floating platform solutions such as the spar and semi-submersible rely on large amounts of ballast and complex structural designs with active stabilisation systems for stability of the floating offshore wind turbine platform (FOWT).The primary focus of this study is to present a design concept and mooring arrangement for an alternative floating platform solution that places emphasis on the mooring system to achieve stability for a FOWT. The tension leg buoy (TLB) is designed to support future 10 MW offshore wind turbine generators. This paper presents the numerical methodology used for a coupled hydro-elastic analysis of the floater and mooring system under combined wind, wave and current effects.A concept TLB design is presented and its platform motion and mooring line tension characteristics are analysed for a three-hour time domain simulation representing operating and survival conditions in the northern North Sea with water depths of 110 metres. The importance of wave drift forces and the other non-linear excitation forces in the concept design stage are evaluated by comparing the motion and tension responses of three different numerical simulation cases with increasing numerical complexity.The preliminary TLB system design demonstrated satisfactory motion response for the operation of a FOWT and survival in a 100-year storm condition. The results show that accounting for second-order effect is vital in terms of having a clear understanding of the full behaviour of the system and the detailed response characteristics in operational and survival conditions. Extreme loads are significantly reduced when accounting for the second-order effects.

Surveys of public opinion show generally high support for renewables, with renewables commonly viewed as a partial solution to three societal challenges: meeting the growing demand for energy, ensuring energy security, and reducing harmful air emissions (Szarka, 2006). Community opposition to proposed projects, however, is still considered a major hurdle to the expansion of renewable energy production (Horbaty, Huber, & Ellis, 2012). This is because widespread adoption of alternative sources of energy requires the construction of new kinds of production facilities, often in locations that have not been used for energy production in the past.The oceans and coasts are primary examples of locations where proposals for the development of renewable energy technologies are being met with mixed public response. Despite the successful deployment of offshore wind energy facilities (i.e., wind farms) in other parts of the world, no offshore wind farms have been constructed in the United States. This is about to change, and the eyes of policy makers and other stakeholders will be focused on Rhode Island over the next two years. A private developer has received all necessary state and federal permits to construct a five-turbine wind farm three miles off the coast of Block Island. Construction will begin in summer 2015, and the facility is scheduled to begin within two years. The successes and failures of this project are likely to have major influence on the renewable energy industry and associated policies in Rhode Island and throughout the U.S.The proposed research will treat the Block Island Wind Farm as a laboratory for understanding public attitudes towards offshore wind energy. Utilizing quantitative social science survey methods, this research will reveal the factors that influence public acceptance of offshore wind energy. With several developments similar to the Block Island project being considered along the eastern U.S. coast and a much larger wind farm proposed further off the Rhode Island shoreline, research of this type is critical and timely. Although researchers have surveyed the public regarding potential and proposed offshore wind farms in the U.S., the Block Island Wind Farm provides a unique opportunity to understand public attitudes on an offshore development prior to construction, during different phases of construction, and in its operational phase, as well as how those attitudes change over time. Findings from this research will contribute important insights into a growing literature and policy conversation on public acceptance of renewable energy development. Moreover, it can inform planning for similar projects on the U.S. coasts and larger developments that have been proposed for waters near Rhode Island.Research questions to be investigated during the proposed work (see below) are drawn from the literature and through past discussions with key stakeholders. These stakeholders include Block Island residents and property owners, wind farm developer Deepwater Wind, the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources, and the University of Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Center. Moreover, pilot work was conducted during summer 2014 via a survey of residents on Block Island and in Narragansett, Rhode Island.This proposed research supports the Rhode Island Plan of Work, which includes a focus on Sustainable Energy, Climate Change, and the Environment. Moreover, it responds to the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) challenge area of securing America's energy future and contributes to its priority for research on bioenergy, natural resources, and environment.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1007596; 812914,,,,,,,,UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:12675315,,

Relatively more convenient accessibility to open sea allows for the installation of larger and larger turbines capable of producing much more power resulting in far lesser number of turbines per wind farm to produce the same amount of power. However, the large size of the turbines (approximate to 200m) implies that they have to operate in conditions affected by phenomena characteristic of marine boundary layer. Complete inversion of wind profiles close to coasts, strong high waves and their interaction with the structures supporting the turbines can have a profound influence on the performance of wind turbines and their life time. A lot of development is taking place in the area of numerical and experimental modeling of wind turbines and its support structures but those studies are generally conducted for idealized cases. In reality the conditions can be markedly different. In order to understanding the behavior of turbines in operational condition, a good understanding of the marine boundary layer and ocean waves is an obvious prerequisite. In the current paper we explain the coupling of an atmospheric code HARMONIE using AROME physics with the ocean wave model WAM. Some preliminary results related to the effects of coupling on wind speed and significant wave height are presented for a few sites close to the Norwegian coast. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this paper, it is a proposed methodology to evaluate the effect of met-ocean conditions on the long-term dynamic behaviour, and energy production, of a floating wind farm. For a sample of 500MW farm located off the coast of Aberdeen (Scotland), 20years of met-ocean data are generated by means of meteorological reanalysis techniques. A subset of 1000 hourly conditions is selected, by means of a maximum dissimilarity algorithm, and input to a dynamic floating wind turbine model. Numerical results are then interpolated for the whole set of met-ocean data, using radial basis functions. This approach allows to dramatically reduce the global computation time. Tower inclination and hub acceleration are chosen as relevant operating parameters: the former mainly depends on mean wind speed and direction, being largest at rated wind speed. The latter is also affected by significant wave height, and reaches its highest values when wind and waves are aligned. For each simulation, any machine exceeding the selected safety threshold is considered to be shut down. Assuming continuous operation, the average lifespan capacity factor of the farm is 50.2%; more restrictive tolerances result in a non-linear reduction of the energy production.

This paper reviews recent research on the biological effects of such discharges with focus on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The greatest concern is linked to effects of produced water. Alkylphenols (AP) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from produced water accumulate in cod and blue mussel caged near outlets, but are rapidly metabolized in cod. APs, naphtenic acids, and PAHs may disturb reproductive functions, and affect several chemical, biochemical and genetic biomarkers. Toxic concentrations seem restricted to <2 km distance. At the peak of discharge of oil-contaminated cuttings fauna disturbance was found at more than 5 km from some platforms, but is now seldom detected beyond 500 m. Water-based cuttings may seriously affect biomarkers in filter feeding bivalves, and cause elevated sediment oxygen consumption and mortality in benthic fauna. Effects levels occur within 0.5-1 km distance. The stress is mainly physical. The risk of widespread, long term impact from the operational discharges on populations and the ecosystem is presently considered low, but this cannot be verified from the published literature.

J,,,,,,,,,"Sweetman, John",,"Floating Offshore Wind Turbines: Conceptual Assessment of Highly Compliant Platforms using Theory, Design and Simulation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 01 2011,2011,"1133862 PI Sweetman The objective of this project is to develop new theory and numerical tools to accurately simulate the behavior of floating offshore wind turbines subject to large angular displacements, and use those results to assess the economic and technical feasibility of potential next-generation structures. Intellectual Merit: The potential for a change in design philosophy from highly rigid wind turbine support structures to highly compliant ones will be investigated. New designs and operational control systems will be developed that allow the tower to lean significantly in response to the wind force, and the technical and economic merits of these new designs will be assessed. A shift to highly compliant structures would be a major shift in design philosophy paralleling that of the offshore oil business as drilling and production moved into very deep water. A family of new designs will be developed with rotational restoring properties ranging from very stiff (very small lean of the tower due to wind) to very compliant (leans easily). These designs will be completed in sufficient detail to identify all challenges to existing technology. Computing the dynamics of these highly compliant structures is both difficult and important, in part because of the gyroscopic effect of the huge whirling blades. This challenge will be met through theoretical development and practical implementation of a new dynamic simulation methodology that could prove useful beyond the field of wind energy to other rotating equipment subject to large angular displacements. The new method will be based on conservation of angular momentum in Euler-space for a cloud of rigid bodies representing a floating wind turbine. Development of this new theory and simulation methodology is necessary because conventional wind turbine design tools do not consider the order of rotation of angular deflections and so are inadequate for large angular motions. Additionally, the overall system is extremely nonlinear: the environmental forcing, hydrostatic restoring moments, time-domain control system, and gyroscopic effects are all nonlinear; accurate simulation in the time domain is necessary to assess the viability of the any design concept. Proof that highly compliant support structures have both technical and economic value could begin a technical revolution that enables economic development of wind farms in very challenging deepwater offshore locations. Broader Impacts: As the US continues to work towards ``greener?? sources of alternative energy, there is increasing interest in installing wind turbines offshore, where good winds and adequate space are both available. Public pressure continues to push for having these structures beyond sight of land, and new technologies are needed for more cost-effective generation of wind-powered electricity in very deep waters. This proposal explores for the first time the viability of highly compliant structures for that purpose, the result of which could be a dramatic shift in the design philosophy for floating wind turbines. The education and outreach components include course development, education of graduate and undergraduate students and outreach to K-12 students and teachers as well as to at-risk college students. The teaching will include development of innovative course curricula on off-shore wind energy to teach about design of both bottom-founded and floating offshore wind turbines, and will include education of graduate and undergraduate students in the rapidly advancing area of offshore wind turbine design. Outreach to K?12 students and teachers will be include presentations on offshore energy by the PI and his graduate students in the well-established ``Sea Camp?? program at Texas A&M at Galveston; outreach to at-risk college students, who include many historically underrepresented and financially disadvantaged students, will be through an established program.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1133682,,,,,,,,Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13505635,,

Juvenile fishes comprised 52.8% (16,952 of 23 species) of all individuals (32,080 juveniles and adults of 35 species) observed during scuba surveys conducted about twice per week at two platforms in the eastern Santa Barbara Channel from May to August 2004. Blacksmith, Chromis punctipinnis (Cooper, 1863), and rockfishes (genus Sebastes, at least 18 taxa) comprised 95.1% of the recruits. Almost all rockfishes recruited to the deepest part of the platforms surveyed (26 and 31 m), while most blacksmith recruited in shallower waters. The onset of the recruitment season for juvenile rockfishes (genus Sebastes, Scorpaenidae) coincided with the advection of a low salinity water mass into the channel from the Southern California Bight. Before arrival of this water mass, water at the platforms resembled upwelled, high salinity water around the Point Conception region at the western channel entrance. Settlement pulses of rockfishes and blacksmith were observed during advective events when salinity decreased in the upper 40 m and currents turned northwestward or intensified in that direction. Two abundant rockfish species [bocaccio, Sebastes paucispinis Ayres, 1854, and treefish, Sebastes serriceps (Jordan and Gilbert, 1880)j showed synchronous patterns of juvenile settlement between platforms separated by 7 km.

South Timbalier Block 86 Platform A (86-A) was toppled by a hurricane in 1985; South Timbalier Block 128 Platform A (128-A) was detonated and toppled in place in the fall of 1988; and South Timbalier Block 134 Platform D (134-D) was detonated, towed, and deployed in 1991 about 30 m from 128-A. The results of a 1989 survey of fishes and invertebrates at 86-A and at 128-A suggested that the communities were more mature at 86-A. The predominance of immature fish and the paucity of adults of those same species on 128-A indicated that this artificial reef was acting as a recruitment site. Observations in 1990 at 86-A were essentially the same as those of 1989, while the communities at 128-A showed a greater diversity and maturity; however, both communities exhibited a decrease in octocoral biomass. Observations in 1991 at 86-A were essentially the same as those of 1989 and 1990, while the communities at 128-A continued to show further development. A large number of immature fish and a pioneering biofouling community at 134-D were comparable to the 1989 observations made at 128-A. Further, adult reef-dependent species were observed moving freely between 128-A and 134-D. Observations made in 1989 at 86-A and 128-A suggest that differences were related to the manner by which each structure was toppled and the length of time each had remained undisturbed; differences observed between 1989 and 1990 were related to time undisturbed and meteorological conditions of the winter of 1989; and differences recorded between 1990 and 1998 were related to continued diversification and maturation of the community at 128-A.

Anthropogenic practices that facilitate species introductions must be identified and modified to improve management and control the spread of non-native taxa in many environments. Maintenance practices that remove dense epifaunal invertebrates attached to offshore structures create a disturbance that may facilitate the establishment of non-native species.2. We evaluated the effect of disturbance on the abundance (percent cover) of a nonnative bryozoan, Watersipora subatra, on an offshore oil platform in the Santa Barbara Channel, USA by removing the existing epifaunal community in experimental plots and comparing Watersipora cover in these plots to that in undisturbed control plots over a 15-month period. We explored the importance of larval supply and the epifaunal community in driving observed patterns, using measurements of Watersipora larval availability and colony recruitment and growth in the disturbed and control plots. We also examined the effect of disturbance on Watersipora establishment at the larger, platform-scale over c. 18 months with comparative surveys of cleaned and uncleaned portions of another oil platform.3. Both the experimental disturbance and the larger platform cleaning facilitated Watersipora establishment, with cover increasing from c. 5% to 20-60% at shallower (<= 12 m) depths within 15 to 18 months following disturbance.4. Initial Watersipora recruitment to the disturbed plots occurred during a period of elevated larval availability, as indicated by recruitment onto settlement plates. However, 1 year after the experimental disturbance, sessile invertebrates occupied all available settlement space, and there was little recruitment of Watersipora into disturbed plots despite the availability of larvae.5. Synthesis and applications. Maintenance operations for offshore structures can include the manual removal of subtidal epibenthic invertebrates attached to the structure. Our study at offshore oil platforms found that this anthropogenic disturbance enhanced the establishment of the non-native invertebrate Watersipora subatra. The timing of disturbance relative to Watersipora's reproductive season was an important driver of this pattern. Scheduling maintenance practices to occur soon after the reproductive period of Watersipora could allow adequate time for native species to recruit and occupy the available bare space, thereby reducing the potential for establishment of this non-native species.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,7,0,9,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUS Dept Interior, Bur Ocean Energy Management, Camarillo, CA USA",,,,2018-06-28,WOS:000434970200003,,

Soaring birds are among the most affected groups with alarming fatality rates by collision with wind turbines and an escalating occupation of their migratory corridors. These birds have been described as changing their flight trajectories to avoid wind turbines, but this behaviour may lead to functional habitat loss, as suitable soaring areas in the proximity of wind turbines will likely be underused. We modelled the displacement effect of wind turbines on black kites (Milvus migrans) tracked by GPS. We also evaluated the impact of this effect at the scale of the landscape by estimating how much suitable soaring area was lost to wind turbines. We used state-of-the-art tracking devices to monitor the movements of 130 black kites in an area populated by wind turbines, at the migratory bottleneck of the Strait of Gibraltar. Landscape use by birds was mapped from GPS data using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models, and generalized additive mixed modelling was used to estimate the effect of wind turbine proximity on bird use while accounting for orographic and thermal uplift availability. We found that areas up to approximately 674 m away from the turbines were less used than expected given their uplift potential. Within that distance threshold, bird use decreased with the proximity to wind turbines. We estimated that the footprint of wind turbines affected 3%-14% of the areas suitable for soaring in our study area. We present evidence that the impacts of wind energy industry on soaring birds are greater than previously acknowledged. In addition to the commonly reported fatalities, the avoidance of turbines by soaring birds causes habitat losses in their movement corridors. Authorities should recognize this further impact of wind energy production and establish new regulations that protect soaring habitat. We also showed that soaring habitat for birds can be modelled at a fine scale using publicly available data. Such an approach can be used to plan low-impact placement of turbines in new wind energy developments.",,,,,,,,,60,2,0,0,37,0,69,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, CE3c Ctr Ecol Evolucao & Alteracoes Ambientais, P-1749016 Lisbon, PortugalUniv Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Ecol Aplicada Prof Baeta Neves CEABN, InBio, Lisbon, PortugalUniv Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, REN Biodivers Chair, CIBIO InBio,Lab Associado, Vairao, PortugalMax Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Migrat & Immunoecol, Radolfzell am Bodensee, GermanyUniv Fed Para, Nucleo Teoria & Pesquisa Comportamento, Belem, Para, BrazilNorwegian Inst Nat Res, Trondheim, NorwayUniv Malaga, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, Biogeog Divers & Conservat Res Team, Malaga, SpainFdn Migres CIMA, Cadiz, SpainUniv Konstanz, Dept Biol, Constance, GermanyUniv Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBio,Lab Associado, Lisbon, Portugal",Fdn Migres CIMA,,,2020-01-01,WOS:000506707800010,30762229,

It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at her home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Prairie View A&M University has potential broader and societal impact in a number of areas. Floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) have been considered as one of the most promising alternatives to access energy resources with vast available space and fewer restrictions and regulations. The project seeks to analyze floating offshore wind turbine uncertainties that arise due to the ocean environment and hydrodynamic calculations, as well as due to uncertainties in the structural and mechanical systems, which threaten the reliability and the feasibility of FOWTs. Undergraduate students, high school students and students from community colleges will gain research experiences through this project. The current floating offshore wind turbine technologies have challenges to be resolved in order to produce sustainable and cost-effective power. Semi-submersible type FOWTs are known to be one of the most promising options with construction and maintenance cost problems yet to be solved. This project focuses on identification of the uncertainties and on estimating the structural safety factors. The research objectives of this project are to: understand the uncertainties that exist in FOWTs; predict the structural behavior and life-cycle structural reliability of FOWTs; and obtain safety factors for structural design of semi-submersible-type FOWTs that uniquely consider the uncertainties and coupled dynamics of aerodynamics of the wind turbine and hydrodynamics of the floating body under extreme environmental loads. By considering the uncertainties found, the probabilistic capacity and demand models for structural components of FOWTs will be developed using a Bayesian Method. Lastly, the developed models will be used to estimate the life-cycle structural reliability and to obtain the safety factors for the base tower moment and shear forces of FOWTs. The results of this research may eventually reduce the current challenge of the high cost of FOWTs.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1700406,,,,,,,,Prairie View A & M University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13548464,,

The uncertainty is made greater by the timescale required for scouring and effects, such as sediment abrasion, pile installation impacts, and operationally and environmentally induced dynamic motions. The rapid growth in offshore wind, particularly in European waters, has led to a requirement for estimates for scour development in such soils. This becomes very pertinent for large-volume serial installation of foundations, such as those required for offshore wind farm developments, given that there is a limit to the amount of detailed geotechnical information that can be collected as part of a project, and soil erosion testing is not standard. There is a reliance in geotechnical data, such as undrained shear strength, derived from cone penetration tests, supplemented with borehole data collected at a limited number of locations across the wind farm site combined with laboratory analysis of soil samples. This paper reviews the present evidence from both field and laboratory measurements of scour potential and looks at possible approaches for determining scour magnitude in cohesive soils including hydraulic and mechanical effects.

Fit-for-purpose monitoring is required with sufficient statistical power to detect ecologically meaningful changes, but to date there have been no studies on the suitability of monitoring programmes applied to OWFs. The theoretical relationship of sampling effort with precision in community estimates and sensitivity of the analysis in detecting spatial changes was investigated, this latter assessed through power analysis. Benthic community monitoring strategies and descriptors applied to UK OWFs were used to interrogate real data variability in the marine environment. There was a general lack of clarity in the survey rationale and hypotheses tested within OWF monitoring programmes hence a lack of rigour in the survey design and statistical testing. Consequently the statistical properties of monitoring strategies have been rarely assessed. Precision of mean estimates of benthic community descriptors and the sensitivity in detecting differences in the means increased with sampling effort. At the average sampling effort applied in the OWF case studies (4 stations per impact type area and 3 replicates per station), the studies had sufficient power to detect a >= 50% change between areas in mean benthic species richness (S; 5 species). Due to their higher variability than S, more stations per impact type area were required to reliably detect a >= 50% change between areas in mean benthic abundance (N; 5 stations) and mean biomass (B; 10 stations). Higher sensitivity and precision of estimates of S, N and B was achieved with transformation of data. Understanding the general implications of monitoring design on the sensitivity of the detection of spatial changes is important, particularly when monitoring effort has to be adjusted due to logistic and financial constraints. Although there is no 'one-size-fits-all approach to marine environmental data acquisition, this study guides researchers, developers and regulators in optimising benthic monitoring strategies at OWFs.

To understand the wind-farm-atmosphere interaction, we conducted wind-tunnel experiments to study the surface scalar (heat) flux using model wind farms, consisting of more than ten rows of wind turbines-having typical streamwise and spanwise spacings of five and four rotor diameters-in a neutral boundary layer with a heated surface. The spatial distribution of the surface heat flux was mapped with an array of surface heat flux sensors within the quasi-developed regime of the wind-farm flow. Although the overall surface heat flux change produced by the wind farms was found to be small, with a net reduction of 4% for a staggered wind farm and nearly zero change for an aligned wind farm, the highly heterogeneous spatial distribution of the surface heat flux, dependent on the wind-farm layout, was significant. The difference between the minimum and maximum surface heat fluxes could be up to 12% and 7% in aligned and staggered wind farms, respectively. This finding is important for planning intensive agriculture practice and optimizing farm land use strategy regarding wind energy project development.

Hence, renewable wind power systems are increasingly receiving the attention of mankind. Energy production with structurally more promising and economically more competitive design is no more the sole criterion while installing new megawatt (MW) range of turbines. Rather important life cycle analysis (LCA) issues like climate change, ozone layer depletion, effect on surrounding environments e.g. ecosystem quality, natural resources and human health emerge as dominant factors from green energy point of view. Hence, the study covers life cycle impact analysis (LCIA) of three wind farms: one onshore horizontal, one offshore horizontal, another vertical axis. It appears that vertical axis wind farm generates per unit electricity with lowest impact followed by horizontal offshore and horizontal onshore farms. The study, henceforward, discovers most adverse impact contributing materials in today's multi megawatt wind turbines and subsequently substitutes copper, the topmost impact contributor, with more eco-friendly aluminum alloys and its corresponding process routes. In this process, it reduces overall life cycle impacts up to 30% for future greener wind farms. In later stages, it compares all major electricity production technologies, viz., oil, diesel, coal, natural gas, wind, solar, biomass, nuclear, hydro plant in a common platform which demonstrates the wind farms performing the best except the hydro-kinetic ones. However, as the study suggests, offshore VAWT farm may even perform better than hydro-kinetic farms because of higher capacity factors in the high sea. Findings from the study can be deployed to harness massive scale green electricity from environmentally more clean and green turbines. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In it, I foreground the complex ways not yet built infrastructure affect Sino-Vietnamese relations as well as our theoretical understanding of the state, especially with regard to Vietnam. Not yet built infrastructure refers to more than the assemblage of things that will be built in the future to power the economy, such as oil rigs, natural gas pipelines, and refineries. The concept also includes the ideological positions that presuppose the materialization of blueprint plans in physical form, i.e., the broader goals such infrastructure is meant to achieve. Towards this end, the article focuses on how state actors and their proxies conceptualize the likely impacts not yet built infrastructure will have upon their respective interests once construction is completed.

The aim is to provide a tool that allows analyzing response of floating turbines to grid faults, interactions and potential conflicts between controllers. A study case of grid disturbance was conducted to illustrate the applicability of an integrated model. A grid fault that lasted 100ms and resulted in 50% residual voltage at the grid connection point was applied, and wind turbine operation both in still water and in large sea wave conditions were analyzed. The results show that the turbine was capable of riding through voltage-dips without severe effects on the electrical or mechanical systems. A significant, but not critical, dip in the tower bending moment was observed. The most affected component of the bending moment is around the axis of the rotor, which is directly related to the loss of generator torque due to the grid disturbance event. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Such connection in the northern Sector is relatively rare, about 23% of platforms being connected. Mean flows connect platforms in 'strings' sharing a common streamline spread by turbulent dispersion. Metrics are devised to indicate how well a particular platform is connected to others. Strings are broken when contributions to the concentration of organisms from platforms fall below detection limits.

However, according to the results of our study, RBG are using the same territory in the same number but distributed in smaller flocks. Our findings do not indicate displacement of RBG from traditional feeding grounds but are associated with the changes in the property of the land in Bulgaria and fragmentation of the crop fields, including those of wheat, which is the main feeding resource of RBG in winter.

The fine-grained sediment contains relatively large biogas bubbles, which has been posing challenges to the stability of offshore foundations supporting oil and gas platforms. Although fine-grained gassy soil was found to exhibit different undrained shear strengths (c(u)) by altering the initial pore pressure, u(i) (relevant to water depth), systematic studies concerning the effect of u(i) on undrained shear behaviours of the soil are still lacking. This study reports a series of undrained triaxial tests aiming to compare and investigate the responses of reconstituted fine-grained gassy soil with the same consolidation pressure (p(c)'), but at a wide range of varying u(i) (0-1000 kPa). The shearing-induced excess pore pressure (Delta u) in the gassy specimens highly depends on u(i). It can be either smaller than that of the saturated specimen with the same p(c)' (due to partial dissipation of Delta u into relatively large bubbles at low u(i)) or larger than that of the saturated specimen (related to collapse of relatively small bubbles at high u(i)). Consequently, the presence of bubbles had beneficially increased cu at relatively low u(i) (u(i)/p(c)' < 0.6), and vice versa. The critical stress ratio of the reconstituted fine-grained gassy soil, however, did not appear to be altered by u(i).",,,,,2nd International Conference on Geoenergy and Geoevironment (GeGe)2nd International Conference on Geoenergy and Geoevironment (GeGe),"JUL, 2017JUL, 2017",,"Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINAZhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA",43,8,0,0,0,0,46,,,0008-3674,1208-6010,,,,,,,,,,"Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Key Lab Offshore Geotech & Mat Zhejiang Prov, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R ChinaHong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaZhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000413922000007,,

In this study, we undertook a thought experiment to assess the potential for increased collision risks to local marine and coastal bird species of integrating small wind turbines (4 units; combined capacity of 200 MWh) into a generalised marine fish farm in western Scotland (UK). Potential risks to bird species were assessed using a bespoke Sensitivity Index (SI) based on 12 factors, including population size, adult survival rate, UK conservation status, flight manoeuvrability, nocturnal flight activity, habitat preference, sensitivity to wind farms, attraction to fish farms for feeding and/or resting, and attraction to other marine anthropogenic structures/activities. SI scores varied substantially between species, but large gulls (Larussp.) and European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) were expected to be at the greatest potential risk.

For sessile, epibenthic marine species, one critical resource is space. We examined competitive success in two invasive Indo-Pacific corals involved in competition for space in the northern Gulf of MexicoTubastraea coccinea and T. micranthuson up to 13 offshore oil/gas platforms south of the Mississippi River. Still-capture photos of thousands of overgrowth interactions between the target corals and other sessile epibenthic fauna were analyzed from ROV videos collected at 8-183 m depth. T. micranthus was observed overgrowing 90% of all sessile epibenthic species which it encountered. Frequencies of competitive success varied significantly between platforms. T. coccinea was competitively superior to all competitors pooled, at the 60% level. There was little variability between T. coccinea populations. T. coccinea encountered the following species most frequentlythe encrusting sponges Xestospongia sp. (with the commensal Parazoanthus catenularis), X. carbonaria, Dictyonella funicularis, Mycale carmigropila, Phorbas amaranthus, and Haliclona vansoestiand was found to be, on average, competitively superior to them. Both T. micranthus and T. coccinea appear to be good competitors for space against these species in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Competitive success in T. micranthus was highest in the NE part of the study area, and lowest in the SW area near the Mississippi River plume. T. coccineas competitive success peaked in the SW study area. This suggests that variation in competitive success both within and between populations of these species may be due to differences in local environmental factors.

Effective modelling of how this affects the populations has to take account of the location and timing of disturbances. Here we construct an individual-based model of harbour porpoises in the Inner Danish Waters. Individuals have their own energy budgets constructed using established principles of physiological ecology. Data are lacking on the spatial distribution of food which is instead inferred from knowledge of time-varying porpoise distributions. The model produces plausible patterns of population dynamics and matches well the age distribution of porpoises caught in by-catch. It estimates the effect of existing wind farms as a 10% reduction in population size when food recovers fast (after two days). Proposed new wind farms and ships do not result in further population declines. The population is however sensitive to variations in mortality resulting from by-catch and to the speed at which food recovers after being depleted. If food recovers slowly the effect of wind turbines becomes negligible, whereas ships are estimated to have a significant negative impact on the population. Annual by-catch rates >10% lead to monotonously decreasing populations and to extinction, and even the estimated by-catch rate from the adjacent area (approximately 4.1%) has a strong impact on the population. This suggests that conservation efforts should be more focused on reducing by-catch in commercial gillnet fisheries than on limiting the amount of anthropogenic noise. Individual-based models are unique in their ability to take account of the location and timing of disturbances and to show their likely effects on populations. The models also identify deficiencies in the existing database and can be used to set priorities for future field research. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Birds' flight heights greatly influence this risk, yet height estimates are currently available only using methods such as radar- or ship-based observations over limited areas. Bird-borne data-loggers have the potential to provide improved estimates of collision risk and here, we used data from Global Position System (GPS)-loggers and barometric pressure loggers to track the three-dimensional movements of northern gannets rearing chicks at a large colony in south-east Scotland (Bass Rock), located <50km from several major wind farm developments with recent planning consent. We estimated the foraging ranges and densities of birds at sea, their flight heights during different activities and the spatial variation in height during trips. We then used these data in collision-risk models to explore how the use of different methods to determine flight height affects the predicted risk of birds colliding with turbines. Gannets foraged in and around planned wind farm sites. The probability of flying at collision-risk height was low during commuting between colonies and foraging areas (median height 12m) but was greater during periods of active foraging (median height 27m), and we estimated that 1500 breeding adults from Bass Rock could be killed by collision with wind turbines at two planned sites in the Firth of Forth region each year. This is up to 12 times greater than the potential mortality predicted using other available flight-height estimates.Synthesis and applications. The use of conventional flight-height estimation techniques resulted in large underestimates of the numbers of birds at risk of colliding with wind turbines. Hence, we recommend using GPS and barometric tracking to derive activity-specific and spatially explicit flight heights and collision risks. Our predictions of potential mortality approached levels at which long-term population viability could be threatened, highlighting a need for further data to refine estimates of collision risks and sustainable mortality thresholds. We also advocate raising the minimum permitted clearance of turbine blades at sites with high potential collision risk from 22 to 30m above sea level.The use of conventional flight-height estimation techniques resulted in large underestimates of the numbers of birds at risk of colliding with wind turbines.

However, design synthesis and analyses of composite risers are more challenging than for conventional metals due to the complex behavior and damage mechanisms which composite materials exhibit. Composite risers are predicted to be a high-impact technology that will be mainstream in the medium term but there is still relatively little literature pertaining directly to the behavior of these materials under the complex loading scenarios arising from their use in deep water structures. Therefore there is a need to perform a review and assessment of the available technologies and methodologies in the literature to gain a good understanding of their predictive capabilities, efficiency and drawbacks.

This approach interprets displacement impacts as a time restricted, quasi-permanent habitat loss rather than a year-on-year effect across the entire operational lifetime of an OWF. It proposes that after displacement impacts have been exerted on a population, a new, stable population equilibrium is reached at some level below the initial starting population. By examining the assumptions underlying this approach and outlining ways of translating it into a staged assessment framework, this report provides an analysis of the pros and cons of the 'Displacement as Habitat Loss' approach. An assessment framework has been developed that is presented, discussed and applied in case studies for two species. Additionally, alternative ways of developing a staged framework to the 'Displacement as Habitat Loss' approach are considered. It has been found that, independent of the focus of any assessment framework, challenges relating to the understanding and assessment of ecological processes governing the strength of any potential displacement effect, will affect the delivery of any potential assessment framework. Estimating (by season) the size of the original habitat, the habitat remaining after displacement impacts have occurred, and the likely number of birds that may need to relocate to alternative (remaining) habitat, appears possible but is challenging in its own right. Available evidence on percentage displacement suggests strong site-specific variations. For assessments the use of generic displacement categories for species (uch as high, medium or low sensitivity) may be best, unless variations can be explained by, for example, habitat quality, which could represent a factor governing the strength of any sitespecific displacement effect. Considerable evidence gaps as well as difficulties with quantitatively assessing those ecological processes, which are subject to considerable natural variability, impede the assessment of the biological consequences of displacement. Quantification of the likely fitness implications of displacement requires a detailed understanding of the degree to which local populations are below, at, or above carrying capacity. This appears to be a precondition of any attempt to estimate what proportion of displaced birds are forced to relocate to alternative habitat and the proportion of those that might be accommodated within remaining habitat without considerable energetic costs. Moreover, if population equilibrium exists in seabird populations, it may not be possible to reliably characterise the point at which this equilibrium has been reached, due to the strong fluctuations that are inherent in marine ecosystems. Population equilibrium is unlikely to be constant and thus separating displacement effects from natural population fluctuations, as well as other pressures on the population being assessed, may be impossible. A clear benefit of a staged assessment framework is that it provides transparency on where assumptions are made in the process and at which stage they are introduced. This is an advantage over the existing 'Displacement Matrix' approach as it helps breakdown the particular areas of uncertainty needing further research. The 'Displacement as Habitat Loss' framework, particularly in later stages, requires empirical evidence on seabird species that are absent from the literature. Each stage has particular uncertainties associated with it, meaning that cumulatively an unacceptable level of uncertainty can be the result. The 'Displacement as Habitat Loss' approach provides a thorough theoretical framework to assess displacement impacts from OWFs. However, the absence of empirical evidence to support/refute various the assumptions required throughout mean that in practice the framework is currently unlikely to be applied in a 'real-world' scenario, until some of the uncertainties have been further explored.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-10-29,ZOOREC:ZOOR15111070166,,

Triphyllozoon arcuatum (MacGillivray, 1889), described originally from Australia, is reported herein from natural substrata in Singapore and natural and artificial substrata in Brazil. Although easily recognizable, the species has not been previously reported from anywhere else in the Atlantic. In the latter instance, the species was collected during monitoring of the invasive scleractinian corals Tubastraea spp. on an oil platform originally from Singapore and now located at Todos os Santos Bay, northeastern Brazil. Colonies of T. arcuatum were also found associated with three species of sponges, giving evidence that it is also growing in the natural environment. Todos os Santos Bay is characterized by intense commercial shipping traffic and oil exploration and the finding of T. arcuatum on an oil platform provides strong evidence that it represents a non-indigenous species in the Atlantic.

In order to evaluate the effect of average and cyclic shearstresses on the undrained cyclic behavior of marine silty sand, cyclic direct simple shear (CDSS) tests are performedwith relative density of 85%, vertical effective stress of 200 and 300 kPa, and failure criteria of either 15% doubleamplitude cyclic shear strain (γcyc) or permanent shear strain (γp).

A technical and economic assessment has been made of electricity generation using wind turbines located at three promising potential wind sites: Sidi Barrani, Mersa Matruh and El Dabaa. These contiguous stations along the coast have an annual mean wind speed greater than 5.0 m/s at a height of 10 m.Weibull parameters and the power law coefficient (n) for all seasons have been estimated and used to describe the distribution and behaviour of seasonal wind speeds at these locations. The annual values of wind potential at the heights of 70-100 m above ground level were obtained by extrapolation of the 10 m data from the results of our previous paper [I] using the powerlaw. The three stations have a high wind power density ranging from 340-425 to 450-555 W/m(2) at the heights of 70 and 100 m, respectively.In this paper, an analysis of the cost of a kwh of electricity generation from two different systems was made, one using a relatively large single wind turbine of capacity 2 MW and the other using 25 small wind turbines (80 kW) arranged in a wind farm of 2 MW total power. The yearly energy output of each system at each site was determined, and the electricity-generating costs in each case was also determined and compared with the generating costs of generating electricity using diesel oil, natural gas and photovoltaic systems furnished by the Egyptian Electricity Authority.The single wind turbine 2 MW was found to be more effective than the wind farm.

The general motivation of the present Special Issue is given by the fact that there has recently been a considerable boost of the quest for wind turbine efficiency optimization in the academia and in the wind energy practitioners communities. The optimization can be focused on technology and operation of single turbine or a group of machines within a wind farm. This perspective is evidently multi-faced and the seven papers composing this Special Issue provide a representative picture of the most ground-breaking state of the art about the subject. Wind turbine power optimization means scientific research about the design of innovative aerodynamic solutions for wind turbine blades and of wind turbine single or collective control, especially for increasing rotor size and exploitation in offshore environment. It should be noticed that some recently developed aerodynamic and control solutions have become available in the industry practice and therefore an interesting line of development is the assessment of the actual impact of optimization technology for wind turbines operating in field: this calls for non-trivial data analysis and statistical methods. The optimization approach must be 360 degrees; for this reason also offshore resource should be addressed with the most up to date technologies such as floating wind turbines, in particular as regards support structures and platforms to be employed in ocean environment. Finally, wind turbine power optimization means as well improving wind farm efficiency through innovative uses of pre-existent control techniques: this is employed, for example, for active control of wake interactions in order to maximize the energy yield and minimize the fatigue loads.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Perugia, Dept Engn, Via G Duranti 93, I-06125 Perugia, Italy",,,,2020-12-31,WOS:000537688400265,,

However, information to forecast population-level consequences of such changes is often lacking. We developed an interim framework to assess the population consequences of disturbance when empirical information is sparse. We show how daily effects of disturbance, which are often straightforward to estimate, can be scaled to the disturbance duration and to multiple sources of disturbance. We used expert elicitation to estimate parameters that define how changes in individual behaviour or physiology affect vital rates and incorporated them into a stochastic population model. Model outputs can be used to evaluate cumulative impacts of disturbance over space and time. As an example, we forecast the potential effects of disturbance from offshore wind farm construction on the North Sea harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) population.Synthesis and applications. The interim framework can be used to forecast the effects of disturbances from human activities on animal populations, to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures and to identify priority areas for research that reduces uncertainty in population forecasts.

Both the number of individuals and the total biomass tended to decrease with depth. The total weight of dead shells always exceeded that of living organisms. Sessile filter feeders dominated the biomass, whereas small mobile forms had the largest number of individuals. The biomass at the deeper platform (22 m) was dominated by bivalves, barnacles and bryozoans, while polychaetes and amphipods had the greatest number of individuals. Biomass values here ranged from 1 g/0.1 m(2) at 20 m to 147 g/0.1 m(2) at 5 m; the corresponding individual numbers were 266 (20 m) and 11,814 indiv./0.1 m(2) (5 m). The results at the shallower platform (11 m) differed in several respects: barnacles clearly dominated over bivalves, and sponges exceeded byrozoans, while total individual numbers fell due to a decline in polychaete dominance. Biomass values here ranged from 84 g/0.1 m(2) at 10 m to 153 g/0.1 m(2) at 0 m; the corresponding individual numbers were 695 (10 m) and 3125 indiv./0.1 m(2) (0 m).

Emissions from oil/gas extraction are sources of air pollutants, but large uncertainties exist with regard to their amounts and composition. In this study, we focus on detailed investigation of emissions from oil/gas extraction in the Norwegian Sea combining measurements from the EU ACCESS aircraft campaign in July 2012 and regional chemical transport modeling. The goal is to (1) evaluate emissions from petroleum extraction activities and (2) investigate their impact on atmospheric composition over the Norwegian Sea. Numerical simulations include emissions for permanently operating offshore facilities from two datasets: the TNO-MACC inventory and emissions reported by Norwegian Environment Agency (NEA). It was necessary to additionally estimate primary aerosol emissions using reported emission factors since these emissions are not included in the inventories for our sites. Model runs with the TNO-MACC emissions are unable to reproduce observations close to the facilities. Runs using the NEA emissions more closely reproduce the observations although emissions from mobile facilities are missing from this inventory. Measured plumes suggest they are a significant source of pollutants, in particular NOx and aerosols. Sensitivities to NOx and NMVOC emissions show that, close to the platforms, O-3 is sensitive to NOx emissions and is much less sensitive to NMVOC emissions. O-3 destruction, via reaction with NO, dominates very close to the platforms. Far from the platforms, oil/gas facility emissions result in an average daytime O-3 enhancement of +2% at the surface. Larger enhancements are predicted at noon ranging from +7% at the surface to +15% at 600 m. Black carbon is the aerosol species most strongly influenced by petroleum extraction emissions.

The aim of this research was to study the fish communities associated with four shipwrecks, by means of underwater visual censuses performed by a remotely operated vehicle, and to test the differences in composition of fish assemblages between these shipwrecks and the adjacent soft bottoms, considered as control sites. Multivariate analysis on the total fish assemblage showed significant differences between wrecks and controls. Results also showed higher levels of species richness and abundance near all wrecks than at a short distance from them on soft bottoms, thus indicating that these sunken vessels, thanks to their higher habitat complexity, act as artificial reefs, attracting aggregations of fish species and leading to a greater diversification of the local fish assemblage. Nevertheless, shipwrecks, which are an ideal target for recreational fishermen, could contribute to the over-exploitation of some high-value fish species, such as Mycteroperca rubra, Dentex dentex and Diplodus spp., attracted by the artificial hard substrate of the vessel-reefs. The recent European directives suggest an urgent need for a better understanding of the crucial role played by these potential sources of pollutants on marine environments and ecosystems.

The scarcity of empirical data regarding fish species that may utilize development sites, further compounded by the novelty of the technology and inherent difficulty of conducting offshore research, make identification and assessment of potential stressors to species of concern problematic. However, there is broad potential to mitigate putatively negative impacts to seasonal migrants during the exploration and construction phases. The goal of this study was to establish baseline information on endangered Atlantic Sturgeon in the NewYorkWind Energy Area (NYWEA), a future offshore development site. Passive acoustic transceivers equipped with acoustic release mechanisms were used to monitor the movements of tagged fish in the NYWEA from November 2016 through February 2018 and resulted in detections of 181 unique individuals throughout the site. Detections were highly seasonal and peaked from November through January. Conversely, fish were relatively uncommon or entirely absent during the summer months (July-September). Generalized additive models indicated that predictable transitions between coastal and offshore habitat were associated with long-term environmental cues and localized estuarine conditions, specifically the interaction between photoperiod and river temperature. These insights into the ecology of marine-resident Atlantic Sturgeon are crucial for both defining monitoring parameters and guiding threat assessments in offshore waters and represent an important initial step towards quantitatively evaluating Atlantic Sturgeon at a scale relevant to future development.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,6,0,9,,,2045-2322,,,,,,,,,,,"SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USAMonmouth Univ, Dept Biol, West Long Branch, NJ 07764 USA",,,,2019-08-27,WOS:000482709400043,31455878,

Riser system is an integral part of floating structure used for such oil and gas extraction from deep water offering a system of drill twines and production tubing to spread the exploration well towards the ocean bed. Thus, the marine risers need to be precisely employed. The incorporation of the strengthening material, fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) for deep and ultra-deep water riser has drawn extensive curiosity in offshore engineering as it might offer potential weight savings and improved durability. The design for FRP strengthening involves the local design for critical loads along with the global analysis under all possible nonlinearities and imposed loadings such as platform motion, gravity, buoyancy, wave force, hydrostatic pressure, current etc. for computing and evaluating critical situations. Finite element package, ABAQUS/AQUA is the competent tool to analyze the static and dynamic responses under the offshore hydrodynamic loads. The necessities in design and operating conditions are studied. The study includes describing the methodology, procedure of analysis and the local design of composite riser. The responses and fatigue damage characteristics of the risers are explored for the effects of FRP strengthening.

These methods enable one to estimate the long-term evolution of the dynamic responses of OWTs due to the degradation of the soil modulus of the foundation under stochastic loading conditions. The results of this study show that random fluctuations of the soil stress caused by stochastic loads (i.e., aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads acting on OWTs) can be described by a Rayleigh distribution and a Gaussian distribution. By using these probabilistic characteristics, the stochastic fluctuations in the soil stress can be rapidly calculated without using Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, a new method based on the derivatives of the degradation functions and on the inverse of these functions is also suggested to calculate the mean degradation index. These methods significantly decrease the computational effort, thus overcoming a critical drawback of existing methods. Case studies demonstrate that the dimensions of the substructures significantly affect the evolution of the dynamic response. This suggests that the evolution of the dynamic response should be considered in the design process to secure the serviceability of OWTs and substructures. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering the existing levels of anthropogenic pressures on coastal fish populations it is becoming increasingly important for developers and environmental regulators to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing fish assemblages. Improving our ability to assess such fish populations in close proximity to structures will assist in increasing this knowledge. In the present study we provide the first trial use of Baited Remote Underwater Stereo-Video systems (stereo BRUVs) for the quantification of motile fauna in close proximity to offshore wind turbines. The study was conducted in the Irish Sea and finds the technique to be a viable means of assessing the motile fauna of such environments. The present study found a mixture of species including bottom dwellers, motile crustaceans and large predatory fish. The majority of taxa observed were found to be immature individuals with few adult individuals recorded. The most abundant species were the angular crab (Goneplax rhomboides) and the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). Of note in this study was the generally low abundance and diversity of taxa recorded across all samples, we hypothesise that this reflects the generally poor state of the local fauna of the Irish Sea. The faunal assemblages sampled in close proximity to turbines were observed to alter with increasing distance from the structure, species more characteristic of hard bottom environments were in abundance at the turbines (e.g. Homarus gammarus, Cancer pagarus, Scyliorhinus spp.) and those further away more characteristic of soft bottoms (e.g. Norwegian Lobster). This study highlights the need for the environmental impacts of offshore renewables on motile fauna to be assessed using targeted and appropriate tools. Stereo BRUVs provide one of those tools, but like the majority of methods for sampling marine biota, they have limitations. We conclude our paper by providing a discussion of the benefits and limitations of using this BRUV technique for assessing fauna within areas close to offshore windfarms.",,,,,,,,,15,1,0,0,10,0,16,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Ecol Ltd, Unit 5, Severnside Pk, Epney GL2 7LN, Glos, EnglandSwansea Univ, Coll Sci, Seagrass Ecosyst Res Grp, Wallace Bldg, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, WalesCMACS Ltd, 80 Eastham Village Rd, Wirral CH62 0AW, Merseyside, England",Ocean Ecol LtdCMACS Ltd,,,2016-03-31,WOS:000371724200048,26934587,

Their interaction can give rise to corrosion fatigue, thus reducing the service life and integrity of the structure. The research community witnesses a challenge to identify damage mechanisms of combined fatigue loading and corrosion, and to link this to the lifetime prediction of offshore structures. In this paper, a non-linear corrosion fatigue model is proposed to describe damage accumulation based on continuum damage mechanics. Fatigue endurance limit, load frequency and corrosion rate are included in the model as basic parameters which influence the interaction between fatigue and corrosion. A sequential load effect is revealed via integration of the non-linear accumulation of damage. Parametric studies are conducted to show the abilities of the model. Preliminary simulation results agree to a strong extent with experimental data in the form of corrosion fatigue S-N curves.

HI-A-389-A is located within Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary boundaries, near East Flower Garden Bank. The monitoring program is funded by NOAA's Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. The artificial structure is dominated by a fouling community comprised of sponges, hydroids, macroalgae, bivalves, barnacles, tunicates, zoanthids, bryozoans, and several stony coral species. The most abundant stony coral was an exotic species, orange cup coral (Tubastraea sp.), native to the Indo-Pacific. Analysis of the benthic community suggests four distinct biological zones occur, likely driven by light availability, wave action, temperature, and sedimentation. Significant changes in the biological community were reported after the removal of the working deck and associated equipment above water, which served as shade structure. The loss of hydroids documented from pre- to post-removal surveys was the most significant difference in the benthic community. Fish species on the platform were primarily invertivores, illustrating a strong link to food sources, given the dominant benthic community. Fishery acoustic surveys documented individual and schools of fish in close proximity to the platform during both pre- and post-removal surveys. Fish were observed throughout the water column prior to removal. Following removal, schools of fish were no longer present in the upper water column, but were present at depth. The water surrounding the platform had minimal changes from 2016 to 2019 and was characteristic of typical open ocean water with seasonal fluctuations.

Data from 36 of the squares with breeding Hen Harriers during the 2000 survey revealed a marginally non-significant negative relationship between wind farm presence and change in the number of breeding pairs between 2000 and 2010.Conclusions: A considerable overlap exists between Hen Harrier breeding distribution and the location of wind farms in Ireland, particularly in areas between 200 and 400m above sea level. The presence of wind farms is negatively related to Hen Harrier population trends in squares surveyed in 2000 and 2010, but this relationship is not statistically significant, and may not be causal.

Loads data for the extreme response analysis involve time-domain simulations for a range of sea states representative of expected site-specific metocean conditions. To gain deeper insight into the dynamic behavior of this system and to obtain long-term loads efficiently and accurately, two studies are carried out sequentially. First, the short-term response of the integrated system is studied based on 1-h simulations for sea states identified using the Environmental Contour method for a 50-year return period. Response extremes for the integrated wind turbine system as well as system sensitivity to metocean conditions are studied. Next, the long-term response associated with the 50-year return period is estimated using statistical extrapolation based on loads derived from the 1-h simulations. Inverse First-Order Reliability Method procedures are employed to seek appropriate response quantile levels, e.g., the median response for 2D Inverse FORM. A more comprehensive 3D approach, which accounts for system response uncertainties, improves long-term response estimates. A proposed adaptive procedure in the 3D approach helps determine the number of simulations needed to guarantee accuracy in the long-term response estimation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, design guidelines for offshore structures usually ignore any soil damping. This paper describes the implementation of a simple geotechnical model in the software package Ashes, which is a servo-hydro-aeroelastic code for wind turbine simulations. In order to investigate the role of the foundation damping, a 20 m monopile supporting structure with a National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5 MW OWT was considered as a case study. The OWT was subjected to standard design load cases and the results were obtained at the mudline of the wind turbine.

Recently the race for space in heavily used areas such as the North Sea triggered the proposal of co-locating other activities such as aquaculture or fisheries with passive gears in offshore wind farms (OWFs). Our interdisciplinary approach combined a quantification of spatial overlap of activities by using Vessel Monitoring System and logbook data with a stakeholder consultation to conclude and verify on the actual feasibility of co-location. In the German Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the North Sea up to 90% of Danish and 40% of German annual gilinet fleet landings of plaice overlapped with areas where OWFs are developed. Our results indicated further that the international gilinet fishery could lose up to 50% in landings within the North Sea German EEZ when OWF areas are closed entirely for fisheries. No spatial overlap was found for UK potters targeting brown crab in the German EEZ. We further identified a number of key issues and obstacles that to date hinder an actual implementation of co-location as a measure in the marine spatial planning process: defining the legal base; implementation of safety regulations; delineation of minimum requirements for fishing vessels such as capacities, quotas, technical equipment; implementation of a licensing process; and scoping for financial subsidies to set up business. The stakeholder consultation verified the scientific findings and highlighted that all those points need to be addressed in a planning process. In the German EEZ we have shown that the socioeconomic importance of spatial overlap varies within planning boundaries. Therefore we recommend an interdisciplinary bottom-up approach when scoping for suitable areas of co-location. Hence, an informed marine spatial planning process requires comprehensive and spatial explicit socio-economic viability studies factoring in also ecological effects of OWFs on target species.

The structured oils had the (n-3) PUFA either mainly at the sn-1,3 position (LML, M = medium-chain fatty acid, L = long-chain fatty acid) or mainly at the sn-2 position (MLM). Oils were administered to lymph-cannulated rats and lymph was collected for 24 h. The fatty acid composition as well as the lipid class distribution of lymph samples was determined. In vitro pancreatic lipase activity was greater when fish oil was the substrate than when the structured oils were the substrates (P < 0.001 at 40 min). This was consistent with a greater 8-h recovery of total fatty acids from fish oil compared with the 2 structured oils (P < 0.05). The absorption profiles of MLM and LML in rats and their in vitro rates of lipase activity did not differ. This indicates that the absorption rate is highly influenced by the lipase activity, which in turn is affected by the fatty acid composition and intramolecular structure.

With ambitious renewable energy targets, pile driving associated with offshore wind farm construction will become widespread in the marine environment. Many proposed wind farms overlap with the distribution of seals, and sound from pile driving has the potential to cause auditory damage. 2. We report on a behavioural study during the construction of a wind farm using data from GPS/GSM tags on 24 harbour seals Phoca vitulina L. Pile driving data and acoustic propagation models, together with seal movement and dive data, allowed the prediction of auditory damage in each seal. 3. Growth and recovery functions for auditory damage were combined to predict temporary auditory threshold shifts in each seal. Further, M-weighted cumulative sound exposure levels [cSELs(Mpw)] were calculated and compared to permanent auditory threshold shift exposure criteria for pinnipeds in water exposed to pulsed sounds. 4. The closest distance of each seal to pile driving varied from 4·7 to 40·5 km, and predicted maximum cSELs(Mpw) ranged from 170·7 to 195·3 dB re 1muPa2-s for individual seals. Comparison to exposure criteria suggests that half of the seals exceeded estimated permanent auditory damage thresholds. 5. Prediction of auditory damage in marine mammals is a rapidly evolving field and has a number of key uncertainties associated with it. These include how sound propagates in shallow water environments and the effects of pulsed sounds on seal hearing; as such, our predictions should be viewed in this context. 6. Policy implications. We predicted that half of the tagged seals received sound levels from pile driving that exceeded auditory damage thresholds for pinnipeds. These results have implications for offshore industry and will be important for policymakers developing guidance for pile driving. Developing engineering solutions to reduce sound levels at source or methods to deter animals from damage risk zones, or changing temporal patterns of piling could potentially reduce auditory damage risk. Future work should focus on validating these predictions by collecting auditory threshold information pre- and post-exposure to pile driving. Ultimately, information on population-level impacts of exposure to pile driving is required to ensure that offshore industry is developed in an environmentally sustainable manner. pv42_data Copyright: CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-05-20,DRCI:DATA2016104008968211,,

Their installation is straightforward, in particular, in shallow and medium waters. While the wind turbine tower is primarily affected by wind, the wave loads are dominant for the monopile, as it is submerged to a large extent. This study deals with the influence of uncertainties in material and load parameters on the behaviour of those structures. It is investigated how the scattering of material properties (namely Young's modulus of elasticity) affect the structural response. In addition, loads with different characteristics are applied, and it is examined how the changes in loads influence the structural response. The analysed output data of interest are the extreme stresses leading to accumulation of fatigue damage. In order for a realistic modelling, wave loads are considered with irregular sea states with different wave characteristics (significant wave heights and wave peak periods). The final aim of the analysis is to classify the effects of specific wave characteristics on the stresses by means of a sensitivity analysis. The analysis shows that variations in the wave peak period have the strongest influence on stress outputs. This effect results from the strong sensitivity of the structural dynamical response to decrease of the difference between the values of the wave peak frequency and the natural frequencies of the structure.

We suggest that mortality of bats at wind turbines may be linked to high-altitude feeding on migrating insects that accumulate at the turbine towers. Modern wind turbines seem to reach high enough into the airspace to interfere with the migratory movements of insects. The hypothesis is consistent with recent observations of bats at wind turbines. It is supported by the observation that mortality of bats at wind turbines is highly seasonal (August-September) and typically peaks during nights with weather conditions known to trigger large-scale migratory movements of insects (and songbirds). We also discuss other current hypotheses concerning the mortality of bats at wind turbines.,,,,,,,,,66,0,0,0,57,0,75,,,1612-4642,1439-0574,,,,,,,,,,"Lund Univ, Dept Biol, S-22362 Lund, SwedenMuseum Hist Nat Bourges, Soc Etude & Protect Mammiferes, F-18000 Bourges, FranceInst Conservacao Nat & Biodiversidade, P-1150294 Lisbon, Portugal",Museum Hist Nat BourgesInst Conservacao Nat & Biodiversidade,,,2010-12-01,WOS:000284426300001,,

In all cases, the study design has both a temporal and a spatial component. Environmental effects monitoring of offshore oil and gas exploration and exploitation could fall into either of the first two categories - the first if a catastrophic event like a blowout was a concern, and the second where long-term chronic pollution, such as by drilling muds or leakage of hydrocarbons, was the primary concern. With the first category, major spills, the temporal and spatial components interact strongly; the spatial extent and the nature of the impact change rapidly over a short time. Before-spill data are extremely desirable, but rarely available. Usually impacted and unimpacted sites are in different areas leading to a confounding of impact effects with natural spatial pattern. With chronic point source pollution a bullseye design usually captures the spatial component (directions and distances), while an equally-spaced series of times, often of indefinite duration, captures the temporal component. Spatial and temporal components interact slightly, such as with seasonal variation in current direction. Examples of this scenario are found in the Gulf of Mexico, offshore northwestern Australia, and Atlantic Canada. Cost-effective implementation of monitoring chronic point source pollution for offshore oil and gas environmental effects monitoring (EEM) requires difficult choices within the bullseye design concept.

Despite all efforts to develop accurate integrated models, these often fail to reproduce the measured natural frequencies, partly due to the modelling of the foundation. Several foundation models and calibration approaches have been proposed and compared with small or large scale field tests, where only the soil and the foundation are included. However, there is a lack of more integral validation where the interaction between the foundation and the structure is taken into account. The paper investigates the impact of the foundation model and calibration approach on the simulated response of a monopile-based OWT installed in the North Sea by comparing simulations and full-scale field data. The OWT structure and the environmental actions are implemented in the aero-servo-hydro-elastic code 3DFloat. Two foundation models and two calibration approaches are evaluated. The results indicate that, with a conceptually correct foundation model and a realistic calibration, it is possible to match the measured natural frequency and predict accurate fatigue loads. More accurate predicted loads will reduce uncertainties in the estimated fatigue lifetime and therefore reduce risk in the design.",,,,,,,,,20,1,0,0,0,0,20,,,0951-8339,1873-4170,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Hogskoleringen 7a, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayNGI, Oslo, NorwayInst Energy Technol IFE, Kjeller, Norway",,,,2019-02-21,WOS:000458228900023,,

Considerable progress has been made in recent years on developing proper models for coupled aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads together with advanced control systems for turbines. These efforts have resulted in a suite of aero-servo-hydro-elastic numerical simulation codes available to the industry. However, proper foundation models have been lagging behind in these tools despite availability of various advanced nonlinear models for foundations in general. This has led to uneconomical design of OWTs that have consistently failed to reproduce the measured natural frequencies and can negatively affect the design and structural performance of OWTs.This paper presents a library of recently developed foundation models based on the theory of plasticity together with their verification against large-scale field test data. These models are cast in the framework of macro-elements that represent the nonlinear response of the soil-foundation system due to arbitrary coupled loads at the seabed. The paper also presents results of the numerical simulations of the dynamic response of a monopile-based OWT in the North Sea using an aero-servo-hydro-elastic code and comparison with the data collected from one of the instrumented OWTs in the field.

While wind turbines fixed to the seabed in shallow water have already been industrialized, floating wind turbines are still at an early stage of development. The cost of wind power is decreasing fast. Yet, the main challenges, especially for novel floating wind turbine concepts, are to increase reliability and reduce costs. The reliability perspective here refers to the lifecycle integrity management of the system to ensure reliability by actions during design, fabrication, installation, operation, and decommissioning. The assessment should be based on response analysis that properly accounts for the effect of different sub-systems (rotor, drivetrain, tower, support structure, and mooring) on the system behavior. Moreover, the load effects should be determined so as to be proper input to the integrity check of these sub-systems. The response analysis should serve as the basis for design and managing inspections and monitoring, with due account of inherent uncertainties. In this paper, recent developments of methods for numerical and experimental response assessment of floating wind turbines are briefly described in view of their use to demonstrate system integrity in design as well as during operation to aid inspection and monitoring.

The poor sighting conditions during the survey limited visual effort and demonstrated the advantage of using acoustic techniques for studying harbour porpoise in winter months. Absolute abundance and density estimates were calculated from acoustic encounter rates using estimates of probability of detection and mean group size. The density of harbour porpoises in the west of the survey area was almost double that in the east, with UK waters to the south-west of the Dogger Bank having the highest density of the area surveyed.

The mean density across the survey area of 0.63 (95% CI 0.27-1.52) individuals km(-2) and distribution of porpoises was similar to that documented in the summer suggesting that high abundance of harbour porpoises in the west of the North Sea is not confined to summer months.

The aim of this paper is to ease the decision-making related with the GBS design, by applying different calculation schemes in the two different hydrodynamic domains, D/L<0.20 (Morison) and D/L>0.20 (Diffraction); observing how the models may be complemented in the previous design, by means of dynamic pressure schemes derived from the mechanic of waves. For that purpose, three case studies are raise; the first one, assuming that the structure is a vertical seawall submitted to a quasi-stationary diagram of hydrodynamic pressures and applying the Goda's theory; the second one, assuming a model of inertial and drag forces, applying the Morison's theory; and finally, the third case propose the use of the Goda's theory in the section near foundation, and the Morison theory in the section of shaft, observing the level of trust and the adjustment of this typology of structures.

This work has been undertaken on behalf of the Offshore Wind Strategic Monitoring and Research Forum (OWSMRF) (https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/owsmrf). OWSMRF is an industry-led collaborative forum that aims to identify and develop research to fill critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of the impact of offshore wind development on the marine environment. OWSMRF stakeholders identified a lack of understanding of cumulative impacts from offshore wind development on kittiwakes as one of the greatest environmental consenting risks. Improving confidence in models that assess population response to offshore wind farm mortality was identified as one of three key knowledge gaps in this area, the other two being: reducing uncertainty around estimates of collision mortality and connectivity between offshore wind farms and SPAs. JNCC organised a workshop that aimed to identify research opportunities that will improve understanding of kittiwake population dynamics and drivers of population change in the context of offshore wind development, thereby improving our ability to predict population response to novel impacts. During the workshop, experts were invited to suggest research that would fill gaps in our current understanding of kittiwake population dynamics, under three high-level objectives: 1 Reduce uncertainty around current PVA (population viability analysis) modelling approaches through obtaining better evidence with which to parameterise PVA models; 2 Improve understanding of the wider context in which current typically colony-specific PVA approaches sit, e.g. the wider spatial scale at which population processes, such as meta-population dynamics and density dependence might be operating; 3 Identify drivers of change in kittiwake populations and their mechanism of operation to understand the relative impact of offshore wind development alongside other pressures, and options for managing pressures to inform discussions around I ROPI/derogation conservation measures. This report provides a summary of existing evidence, followed by research opportunities (RO) suggested by experts that would fill gaps in our current understanding of kittiwake population dynamics in the context of offshore wind development. The research opportunities were: Research Opportunities leading to better parameterisation of current population modelling approaches and improved understanding of wider context of kittiwake population dynamics (Objectives 1 and 2 above): RO3.1 Use of large-scale strategic modelling approaches to better understand kittiwake meta-population dynamics and estimate connectivity among colonies. This project makes use of an existing meta-population modelling framework, which has been developed by the University of Glasgow, to estimate the strength of connectivity among kittiwake colonies in key areas of Britain and Ireland. The outputs of this model will also inform the optimisation of future monitoring and data collection of the most influential demographic parameters. This would provide a better understanding of the wider population context in which individual kittiwake SPA colony dynamics operate, e.g. is the Flamborough and Filey Coast SPA operating as a source or sink population and how does this change predictions of population response to additional mortality? RO3.2 Further development of a population modelling tool that assists with assessing population response to changes in mortality or productivity. This project will add additional functionality to an existing on-line PVA Tool, specifically a meta-population function that allows emigration and immigration to be incorporated into the population models. Movement rates will be informed by the outputs of RO3.1. This would improve confidence in predicted population response to estimated mortality from a planned offshore wind development by bringing more biological realism to current PVA approaches. It would also enable better modelling of other management measures that could increase productivity and survival, thereby informing evaluation of conservation measures. RO3.3 Strategic mark-recapture studies to improve empirical estimates of connectivity and survival. This project will assess the feasibility of a large-scale kittiwake mark-recapture study, such as colour-ringing, in the UK to improve empirical estimates of key demographic rates such as survival and dispersal rates. Better estimates of these parameters are needed to improve the parameterisation of PVA and meta-population models, e.g. RO3.1 and RO3.2, leading to improved confidence in predictions of how kittiwake populations are likely to respond to offshore wind farm mortality. RO3.4 Reconstructing adult survival rates for populations where empirical estimates are lacking. This project addresses the lack of population-specific empirical estimates of kittiwake survival rates. It will make use of an existing modelling approach developed by the University of Glasgow to reconstruct survival estimates for kittiwake colonies of interest where this information is lacking. This information would enable better parameterisation of population models, as described in RO3.1 and RO3.2. RO3.5 Estimating the form and strength of compensatory density-dependence in kittiwake population dynamics at different spatial scales. This project makes use of the rich kittiwake colony monitoring datasets available in the UK, as well as existing robust population modelling approaches, to try to detect patterns of compensatory density-dependence in kittiwake colonies. The form and strength of density dependence used in PVA models strongly influences model predictions about how the population will respond to additional mortality. Obtaining and implementing novel empirical data on how density dependence operates on populations and the spatial and temporal scales over which density dependence might occur will improve confidence in PVA predictions. RO3.6 Detecting depensation effects by modelling kittiwake population dynamics. With this project, it is proposed to build a model to assess the relative importance of depensatory density dependence in breeding kittiwake populations, evaluate its strength and infer where and when this process may be more likely to occur. Identifying at what population size/density kittiwake populations are at risk of declining to extinction due to depensation effects is important as additional mortality on populations could inadvertently push populations into such a decline. RO3.7 Evaluating the proportion of UK kittiwake populations that are non-breeding adults. This RO is a desk-based study to estimate the extent of non-breeding in UK kittiwake populations using available data on population size, breeding success and adult survival. The results from this RO would help better estimate the proportion of non-breeders in kittiwake populations and anticipate their ability to buffer a population against declines (including steeper declines for already declining populations) in size due to reduced adult survival and/or productivity. This will bring more biological realism to current PVA models and improve confidence in predictions about how populations will respond to offshore wind mortality. Research Opportunities focussing on understanding potential kittiwake population response to changes in management of drivers of population change (Objective 3 above): RO3.8 Examining the ecosystem processes driving the relationship between kittiwake breeding success and sea surface temperature. This RO will improve understanding of how climate change is impacting kittiwake productivity and how other factors may be compounding the negative effects of warming seas. This RO will examine how various environmental and biological factors may have led to variation in breeding success between colonies and within colonies over time. Better understanding of what determines productivity at different colonies will improve predictions of how kittiwake populations are likely to change in the future due to climate change, along with other drivers of change such as offshore wind development. It will also ensure that potential conservation measures account for environmental and biological drivers of population change, and that conservation measures are effective and achieve the desired outcomes. RO3.9 Kittiwake diets during the breeding season, and the relationship between prey availability and productivity. This project is a combination of desk-based and field studies to determine kittiwake dietary patterns during the breeding season and improve our understanding of the relationship between non-sandeel prey availability and productivity. This RO will help build confidence in how kittiwake populations are responding to declines in sandeel availability and thus assess their resilience to additional mortality, e.g. from offshore wind development. This would also provide key evidence to inform conservation measures, such as how kittiwake populations might respond to changes in management of commercial fisheries. RO3.10 Assessing the current and future condition of alternative fish prey populations: a desk-based study. With this RO, it is proposed to review the literature on forage fish species, specifically population status and trends, drivers of population dynamics, current fishing pressure and projected impacts of climate change on forage fish populations. This information will assist with identifying kittiwake colonies that are vulnerable to additional mortality and those that are likely to be more resilient to additional mortality, e.g. from OWF development, due to predicted availability of prey/forage fish species. Additionally, this will help assess which conservation management measures may be ineffective due to changes in forage fish populations. RO3.11 Quantifying the effects of fisheries management on kittiwake demography. This RO involves designing a monitoring plan that would maximise power to detect changes in demographic rates that could be attributed to changes in fisheries management. This would be followed by data collection prior to changes in fishing effort, which would provide a baseline against which to assess demographic response to management. This project will enable evaluation of the effectiveness of fishing-related conservation measures. RO3.12 Predicting the demographic consequences of various potential measures to manage pressures on kittiwake populations. This project would develop a strategic modelling framework that would enable identification of those pressures that exert the most detrimental effects on kittiwake demographic rates and then evaluate potential management options in terms of population rates of change. This information would bring wider context to current PVA assessments of population response to offshore wind mortality and inform likely efficacy of potential conservation measures. Specifically, this project would demonstrate the relative impact of offshore wind development on kittiwake populations, alongside other drivers of population change. Several of these research opportunities would complement each other, and combined, could greatly increase our understanding of kittiwake population dynamics and how populations are likely to respond to offshore wind farm development and conservation management measures. This would lead to significant reductions in uncertainty in assessments of cumulative impacts on kittiwake from offshore wind farm developments.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-05-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15712083127,,

These areas have developed rapidly, due to availability of faster computers. These different disciplines have fundamentally different conceptual frameworks, but the combination of techniques offers an unparalleled opportunity to model swimming animals in water more accurately. More accurate models of dispersion, migration and other spatial dynamics would support a better informed ecosystem management and provide methods to define protected areas that are linked in coherent networks. Development plans for tidal power schemes and offshore wind farms mean that predictive models of migrating fish are needed urgently. Statistical models based on correlations become inaccurate as the environments move to previously unobserved states.

Monitoring was performed during routine O&G industrial operations for underwater noise mitigation purposes, and to ensure adherence to regulatory guidelines.

Besides, this curve is considerably affected by deformation characteristics of soil defined as the soil strain at 50% of maximum deviatoric stress (epsilon(50)). In this research, several models are proposed based on the strength and deformation characteristics of soil. These models are applied to predict epsilon(50) and specifically to investigate the lateral behavior of very long pile foundations of offshore oil and gas platforms in South Pars field in Persian Gulf, Iran. Herein, evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR) is used to obtain epsilon(50) from extensive soil data of marine clays including in-situ and laboratory test results. It is shown that more realistic values of epsilon(50) are obtained from cone tip resistance of CPT comparing to that of laboratory-derived undrained shear strength parameter. The results obtained from the most appropriate proposed model (Model 5) are compared with those of existing ones, available in the literature. The application of this model is investigated in predicting lateral load-displacement of tested full-scale piles. It is shown that the results predicted by Model 5 agree relatively well with the measured values. Furthermore, Model 5 has been successfully verified by the data obtained from another surveyed area, outside the main studied area used for its development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A 1:50 scale model was tested under regular and irregular waves to characterise the hydrodynamic response of the WEC sub-system.

In the oceans, generate impacts on benthic and pelagic marine communities, and consequently on the marine landscapes. In the mid-1980s, the coral species Tubastraea coccinea and Tubastraea tagusensis were accidentally introduced to the Brazilian coast, probably embedded in oil and gas platforms. Currently, such species are registered in most Brazilian coastal zones, including several protected areas. Commonly known as sun-corals, these species have several characteristics that give them high dispersal potential and, thus, have been systematically recorded, altering the marine landscape and affecting the functioning of invaded ecosystems. In Buzios Island, north coast of the State of São Paulo - where these species settled in high densities covering in some points almost 100% of the consolidated substrate - numerous changes in the benthic infralittoral community were measured. In addition, significant changes were observed in the unconsolidated substrate adjacent to the high concentration of these invaders. Adult colonies of Tubastraea are naturally coming off the vertical substrate and settling on adjacent sandy sediments, becoming a substrate for other species in a process known as invasion meltdown. As a result, several changes in the sandy landscape have been occurring and are likely to have significant consequences for the benthic communities of these unconsolidated bottoms as well as for the pelagic organisms that use them. Thus, through periodic sampling and manipulative in situ experiments, this interdisciplinary project aims to evaluate changes in benthic macrofauna communities resulting from the deposition of Tubastraea colonies in unconsolidated sediments.

Offshore wind farm projects require large-scale ecological surveys before, during and after construction, in order to assess potential effects on the distribution and abundance of protected species. The robustness of site-specific population estimates depends largely on the extent and design of spatial coverage and the accuracy of the applied census technique. Standard environmental assessment studies in Germany have so far included aerial visual surveys to evaluate potential impacts of offshore wind farms on seabirds and marine mammals. However, low flight altitudes, necessary for the visual classification of species, disturb sensitive bird species and also hold significant safety risks for the observers. Thus, aerial surveys based on high-resolution digital imagery, which can be carried out at higher (safer) flight altitudes (beyond the rotor-swept zone of the wind turbines) have become a mandatory requirement, technically solving the problem of distant-related observation bias. A purpose-assembled imagery system including medium-format cameras in conjunction with a dedicated geo-positioning platform delivers series of orthogonal digital images that meet the current technical requirements of authorities for surveying marine wildlife at a comparatively low cost. At a flight altitude of 425 m, a focal length of 110 mm, implemented forward motion compensation (FMC) and exposure times ranging between 1/1600 and 1/1000 s, the twin-camera system generates high quality 16 bit RGB images with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 2 cm and an image footprint of 155 x 410 m. The image files are readily transferrable to a GIS environment for further editing, taking overlapping image areas and areas affected by glare into account. The imagery can be routinely screened by the human eye guided by purpose-programmed software to distinguish biological from non-biological signals. Each detected seabird or marine mammal signal is identified to species level or assigned to a species group and automatically saved into a geo-database for subsequent quality assurance, geo-statistical analyses and data export to third-party users. The relative size of a detected object can be accurately measured which provides key information for species-identification. During the development and testing of this system until 2015, more than 40 surveys have produced around 500.000 digital aerial images, of which some were taken in specially protected areas (SPA) of the Baltic Sea and thus include a wide range of relevant species.

The weather may deteriorate facility components at a higher rate, and delay operations, emergency and evacuation procedures. Moreover, these regions host unique ecosystems, and their preservation is a worldwide priority. For this reason, a comprehensive and systematic approach for risk analysis is necessary to prevent major accidents and comply with Arctic pollution control. A novel approach for dynamic risk assessment and management, based on Bayesian Networks and safety barrier assessment, is suggested. The method is applied to the Goliat Oil&Gas platform located in the Barents Sea and risk data on the Norwegian petroleum activities are used as evidence to simulate continuous update of risk assessment throughout the years. The case study shows the benefits and limitations of such approach. Accurate modelling of potential accident scenarios is possible through BNs, but time-consuming. The approach allows for drill-down capabilities, which enhance support of operations and definition of risk mitigating measures. However, the data used for dynamic risk assessment has a pivotal role, as data quality and quantity sensibly affect the outcome. Fortunately, the Oil&Gas industry is committed to improving collection of field data for the assessment of safety barrier performance. This approach represents a strategy to process deviations and resilient reactions, regularly iterating dynamic risk assessment to support risk management of critical systems, such as the Oil&Gas production in the arctic and sub-arctic regions.",,,,,,,,,30,1,0,0,0,0,31,,,0925-7535,1879-1042,,,,,,,,,,"Sapienza Univ, Dept Chem Mat & Environm Engn, Rome, ItalyNTNU, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Trondheim, Norway",,,,2019-12-09,WOS:000496603900027,,

Identification and quantification of these breeding habitats are essential to effective conservation. Satellite telemetry and switching state-space modeling (SSM) were used to define inter-nesting habitat of endangered Kemps ridley turtles (Lepidochelys kempii) in the Gulf of Mexico. Turtles were outfitted with satellite transmitters after nesting at Padre Island National Seashore, Texas, USA, from 1998 through 2013 (n = 60); Rancho Nuevo, Tamaulipas, Mexico, during 2010 and 2011 (n = 11); and Tecolutla, Veracruz, Mexico, during 2012 and 2013 (n = 11). These sites span the range of nearly all nesting by this species. Inter-nesting habitat lies in a narrow band of nearshore western Gulf of Mexico waters in the USA and Mexico, with mean water depth of 14 to 19 m within a mean distance to shore of 6 to 11 km as estimated by 50% kernel density estimate, alpha-Hull, and minimum convex polygon methodologies. Turtles tracked during the inter-nesting period moved, on average, 17.5 km/day and a mean total distance of 398 km. Mean home ranges occupied were 725 to 2948 km2. Our results indicate that these nearshore western Gulf waters represent critical inter-nesting habitat for this species, where threats such as shrimp trawling and oil and gas platforms also occur. Up to half of all adult female Kemps ridleys occupy this habitat for weeks to months during each nesting season. Because inter-nesting habitat for this species is concentrated in nearshore waters of the western Gulf of Mexico in both Mexico and the USA, international collaboration is needed to protect this essential habitat and the turtles occurring within it.

We find that the size of the wind wake is an important factor for the oceanic response to the wind farm. We show through simple analytical models and idealized numerical experiments that a wind speed of 5-10 m/s may generate upwelling/downwelling velocities exceeding 1 m/day if the characteristic width of the wind wake is of the same size or larger than the internal radius of deformation. The generated upwelling is sufficiently enough that the local ecosystem will most likely be strongly influenced by the presence of a wind farm. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The number of wind farms is increasing worldwide. Despite their purported environmental benefits, wind energy developments are not without potential adverse impacts on the environment, and the current pace and scale of development proposals, combined with a poor understanding of their impacts, is a cause for concern.2. Avian mortality through collision with moving rotor blades is one of the main adverse impacts of wind farms, yet long-term studies are rare. We analyse bird fatalities in relation to bird abundance, and test several factors which have been hypothesized to be associated with bird mortality.3. Bird abundance was compared with collision fatality records to identify species-specific death risk. Failure time analysis incorporated censored mortality data in which the time of event occurrence (collision) was not known. The analysis was used to test null hypotheses of homogeneity in avian mortality distribution according to several factors.4. There was no clear relationship between species mortality and species abundance, although all large-bird collision victims were raptors and griffon vulture Gyps fulvus was most frequently killed. Bird mortality and bird abundance varied markedly among seasons, but mortality was not highest in the season with highest bird abundance. Mortality rates of griffon vultures did not differ significantly between years.5. Bird collision probability depended on species, turbine height (taller = more victims) and elevation above sea level (higher = more victims), implicating species-specific and topographic factors in collision mortality. There was no evidence of an association between collision probability and turbine type or the position of a turbine in a row.6. Synthesis and applications. Bird abundance and bird mortality through collision with wind turbines were not closely related; this result challenges a frequent assumption of wind-farm assessment studies. Griffon vulture was the most frequently killed species, and species-specific flight behaviour was implicated. Vultures collided more often when uplift wind conditions were poor, such as on gentle slopes, when thermals were weak, and when turbines were taller at higher elevations. New wind installations and/or repowering of older wind farms with griffon vulture populations nearby, should avoid turbines on the top of hills with gentle slopes.",,,,,,,,,160,0,0,0,146,0,184,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"CSIC, Estac Biol Donana, Seville 41013, SpainNat Res Ltd, Banchory Business Ctr, Banchory AB31 5ZU, Kincardine, Scotland",Nat Res Ltd,,,2008-12-01,WOS:000260257800017,,

These contiguous stations along the coast have an annual mean wind speed greater than 5.0 m/s at a height of 10 m. Weibull's parameters and the power law coefficient for all seasons have been estimated and used to describe the distribution and behavior of seasonal winds at these stations. The annual values of wind potential at the heights of 70-100 m above the ground level were obtained by extrapolation of the 10 m data from the results of our previous work using the power law. The three stations have a high wind power density, ranging from 340-425 to 450-555 W/m(2) at the heights of 70-100 m, respectively. In this paper, an analysis of the cost per kWh of electricity generated by two different systems has been made: one using a relatively large single 2 MW wind turbine and the other -25 small wind turbines ( 80 kW, total 2 MW) arranged in a wind farm. The yearly energy output of each system at each site was determined, and the electricity generation costs in each case were also calculated and compared with those at using diesel oil, natural gas and photovoltaic systems furnished by the Egyptian Electricity Authority. The single 2 MW wind turbine was found to be more efficient than the wind farm.

This study presents a geo-located life cycle assessment of an emerging technology, namely, floating offshore wind farms. It is developed and applied to a pilot project in the Mediterranean Sea. The materials inventory is based on real data from suppliers and coupled to a parameterized model which exploits a geographic information system wind database to estimate electricity production. This multi-criteria assessment identified the extraction and transformation of materials as the main contributor to environmental impacts such as climate change (70% of the total 22.3 g CO2 eq/kWh), water use (73% of 6.7 L/kWh), and air quality (76% of 25.2 mg PM2.5/kWh), mainly because of the floater's manufacture. The results corroborate the low environmental impact of this emerging technology compared to other energy sources. The electricity production estimates, based on geo-located wind data, were found to be a critical component of the model that affects environmental performance. Sensitivity analyses highlighted the importance of the project's lifetime, which was the main parameter responsible for variations in the analyzed categories.

In this review, potential consequences for fish stocks and fisheries are evaluated based on available information, and the most critical gaps of knowledge in assessing environmental impacts are identified. A lack of empirical data and scientifically evaluated case studies is recognized. Together with the fact that many commercial species are close to or below biologically secure limits, this makes a strong case for emphasizing efforts to minimize potential negative effects on fish in the establishment of offshore wind farms. 1. Large part of the evaluations presented in this review is based on general ecological knowledge and experiences from other marine activities, rather than from actual wind farms. A critical concern is that only few of the results referred to have been scientifically evaluated.2. The risk for negative effects may in many cases be reduced by technical solutions, and by considering local ecological processes during planning.Monitoring of established wind farms is essential both for increasing knowledge on the effects on fish, and for identifying correct mitigation actions where needed. 3. During the construction stage, a general risk to particularly young life stages of fish is identified. The expected types of impact are similar to those in other marine activities, such as piling and dredging, but the geographical and temporal extent is expected to be higher. I order to minimize negative effects, establishment should be avoided in significant recruitment areas, and construction activities should be avoided during critical reproductive seasons. Research should focus on identifying essential fish habitats for purposes of marine planning, and on the development of construction methods that minimize negative effects. 4. During the operational stage, a low level of impact on fish is generally assumed, however the current state of knowledge in this field is poor. The two most critical issues identified are how the introduction of new physical structures affects local ecological community structures, and how the quality of fish recruitment areas is affected by increased noise. In order to minimize negative effects, establishment should be avoided in areas that are currently undisturbed by human activities, and in significant recruitment areas. The development of methods that minimize the effects of noise and electromagnetism should be favoured. 5. Off-shore wind farms are associated with restrictions to fishing by reduced access or gear restrictions. This has direct economical consequences for the fishermen affected. In large wind farms, reduced fishing efforts may have a positive effect on the growth of local commercial stocks, provided however that the stocks are not negatively affected by other types of impact from the wind farm. 6. Some fish species may be attracted to the wind farm area and others may avoid it. The catchability of fish is likely to increase in areas where fish is aggregated, which may have to be considered specifically in estimations of local stock sizes and management. 7. Changes in other parts of the ecosystem may have indirect on fish, for example changes in food supply. Ecologically integrated monitoring programs may reveal potential mechanisms behind any observed changes, and support the identification of areas most appropriate for large scale exploitation. 8. The expected level of impact is strongly dependent on local ecological conditions. However, current knowledge on the distribution and function of essential fish habitats in Swedish waters is too low to directly identify geographic areas most appropriate for exploitation. 9. In general, shallow areas have a higher potential value in terms of productivity, and establishment here is associated with a higher level of ecological risk. The current state of knowledge suggests that the risk for negative effects is lowest in areas below 15-20 meters depth, and in areas where the level ofhuman impact is currently high. In such areas, potential positive artificial reef effects are also expected to be highest. The highest level of risk is associated with relatively undisturbed off-shore shallows.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1404-8590,,,,,,,,,,,"Fiskeriverkets Kustlaboratorium, Box 109, 742 22 Oregrund, Sweden",,,,2007-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14407039215,,

Airborne taxa such as birds may be particularly sensitive to collision mortality with wind turbines, yet the relative vulnerability of species' populations across their annual life cycles has not been evaluated. Using GPS telemetry, we studied the movements of lesser black-backed gulls Larus fuscus from three UK breeding colonies through their annual cycle. We modelled the distance travelled by birds at altitudes between the minimum and maximum rotor sweep zone of turbines, combined with the probability of collision, to estimate sensitivity to collision. Sensitivity was then combined with turbine density (exposure) to evaluate spatio-temporal vulnerability. Sensitivity was highest near to colonies during the breeding season, where a greater distance travelled by birds was in concentrated areas where they were exposed to turbines. Consequently, vulnerability was high near to colonies but was also high at some migration bottlenecks and wintering sites where, despite a reduced sensitivity, exposure to turbines was greatest. Synthesis and applications. Our framework combines bird-borne telemetry and spatial data on the location of wind turbines to identify potential areas of conflict for migratory populations throughout their annual cycle. This approach can aid the wind farm planning process by: (a) providing sensitivity maps to inform wind farm placement, helping minimize impacts; (b) identifying areas of high vulnerability where mitigation warrants exploration; (c) highlighting potential cumulative impacts of developments over international boundaries and (d) informing the conservation status of species at protected sites.

In addition to a standard boxcorer for common macrofauna, a Triple-D dredge was used to collect longer-lived, more sparsely distributed infauna and epifauna. Multivariate analysis did not reveal any difference between the assemblages in and outside OWEZ with respect to abundance, biomass, and production after a 5-year closure. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index pointed to a significantly higher diversity in OWEZ compared with some of the reference areas. A minority of the bivalve species assumed to be sensitive to trawling showed higher abundances (Spisula solida) or larger sizes (Tellina fabula, Ensis directus) in OWEZ than in some of the reference areas. In general, samples collected with the Triple-D showed more differences between areas than boxcore samples. No evidence was also found that the species composition in OWEZ relative to the reference areas had changed in the period between 1 (2007) and 5 (2011) years after closure. The change observed in all areas between 2007 and 2011 was mainly due to relatively small variations in species abundances. In conclusion, 5 years after the closure of OWEZ to fisheries, only subtle changes were measured in the local benthic community, i.e. a higher species diversity and an increased abundance and lengths of some bivalves. Depleted adult stocks, faunal patchiness, and a limited time for recovery (5 years) might explain that a significant recovery could not be found.

Side scan sonar data from the CL were used to facilitate the understanding. The sub bottom (SB) seismic data were processed and interpreted by means of the SeisPrho software, the side scan sonar (SSS) data by SonarWiz5 software and the spatial extension being measured with the help of GIS. The shallow gas structures were defined in accordance with their shapes in the seismic recordings (echo-character). At the CL, shallow gas accumulations were found in the form of seepages and features presenting shallow gas structures between the surface and 8.20 ms (around 12.3 m). Accumulations of gas were found in the form of Acoustic Blanking with Acoustic Plume, and also Black Shadows. Pockmarks were found on the lagoon floor and associated with gas seepages (average size diameter 0.97 0.19 m and density from 54 to 242 units per 50 m2). In the NB three types of shallow gas features were found in the seismic profile, namely Acoustic Blanking, Turbidity Pinnacles and Intra-sedimentary plumes. The depth varied from the surface to 12.10 ms (around 18.15 m). In both environments, the gas is escaping from the sediment into the water column. The Pockmarks in the CL and the Acoustic Plume features and sediment rich in total sulfur in the NB validate these findings.

The two smallest blennies with external characters normally associated with sexual maturity were a 20 mm male and 21 mm female H. multifilis primary caudal fin rays began to bifurcate between 17.0 and 18.3 mm L-S in H. invemar, H. ionthas, H. multifilis and S. cristata. Hypleurochilus multifilis displayed the external characteristics of being sexually mature at 20-21 mm L-S. Thus, bifurcation of primary caudal fin rays seas an indicator of approaching sexual maturity in H. multifilis and this may also be true in the other species studied.

Wind energy is one of the renewable energy sources and is considered to be self-renewable as it is the result of the Sun's activity. Using wind energy is a rapidly developing industry today, and more and more wind turbines are installed worldwide every year, land-based wind turbines being more widespread than offshore ones. In Latvia, spread of land-based wind parks is hampered by unsettled land ownership rights, while the deployment of wind parks in the sea is a new field for all Baltic States. The neighbouring countries Estonia and Lithuania have developed their own projects for offshore wind parks, therefore the topicality of the development of wind farms in the territorial waters of Latvia has also increased. Experts have proposed best options and their locations. When assessing possibilities for development of wind parks and their capacity, the following economic factors were evaluated: construction and connection costs, potential operational costs and energy prices. The aim of this study is to develop the methodology for calculating the area of a potential wind park by considering the safety distance to shipping routes and height of the wind turbines, as well as for calculating the potential capacity of a wind park.",,,,,3rd International Conference on Power and Renewable Energy (ICPRE)3rd International Conference on Power and Renewable Energy (ICPRE),"SEP 21-24, 2018SEP 21-24, 2018",Univ Elect Sci & Technol China; SE Univ; Tongji Univ; Oxford Univ Press Clean EnergyUniv Elect Sci & Technol China; SE Univ; Tongji Univ; Oxford Univ Press Clean Energy,"Berlin, GERMANYBerlin, GERMANY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2267-1242,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Univ Latvia, Sci Inst Econ & Management, Riga, Latvia",,,,2019-05-17,WOS:000466977400031,,

Sheens may commonly occur around offshore oil and gas platforms in Atlantic Canada, however, there is little information on regularity of occurrence. Further, there are few direct studies on potential impacts of sheens, associated with offshore oil and gas operations, on marine birds. We reviewed potential sources and frequency of hydrocarbon accumulation on sea surfaces from offshore oil and gas operations in Atlantic Canada, and the likelihood of overlap with marine birds. We conducted a literature review on lethal and sub-lethal effects of low levels of oil contact and ingestion on marine birds, focusing on studies that describe measured dosages of oil. We extrapolated from these data on low-dose oil exposure to link possible effects to marine birds resulting from exposure to sheens. We found that sheens occur around production operations in Atlantic Canada at allowable levels of oil concentrations in produced water. Frequency and extent of occurrence cannot be estimated from current monitoring practices. While immediate lethal effects to seabirds likely are not common from external oiling of feathers from sheens, added stressors, such as cold weather, can result in external oiling from sheens having significant impact on seabird metabolic rate and can be ultimately lethal. Ingestion of small amounts of oil, doses that realistically could be expected from exposure to sheens, in some cases resulted in sub-lethal effects to adult seabirds, primarily affecting metabolic rate, sub-lethal health impacts, and reproductive output. Nestlings and eggs do not come in direct contact with sheens, yet these life stages are highly sensitive to oil, and transfer of oil from adults exposed to sheens likely is above tolerance levels at times. Negative effects to reproductive output from small doses of ingested oil could be causing undetected impacts on marine birds and marine bird populations. Lack of standardized monitoring of marine bird contact with sheens and potential harm makes assessments of magnitude and extent of impact problematic.",,,,,,,,,8,1,0,0,10,1,12,,,1208-6053,1181-8700,,,,,,,,,,"Morandin Ecol Consulting, Victoria, BC, CanadaCanadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Inst Ocean Sci, 9860 W Saanich Rd, Sidney, BC, CanadaUniv Victoria, Dept Biol, Stn CSC, Victoria, BC, Canada",Morandin Ecol Consulting,,,2016-10-05,WOS:000382160800005,,

However, the reliability of such data is largely unknown. The results of trials where rangefinder height estimates were compared with those of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) used to mimic a flying bird at varying distances and heights from the operator suggested that the rangefinder performed well, with an overall mean deviation from the actual UAV height of -0.4m. Accuracy and precision were influenced by an interaction between UAV height and distance to the surveyor. We also compared measurements of the flight heights of 16 species of seabirds made with an optical rangefinder to surveyor estimates made in 5-m bands during boat-based surveys off the east coast of Scotland UK from May to October 2017. Overall agreement between the rangefinder and surveyor estimates (N=1235) was 58%, but increased to 92% when including the adjacent 5-m bands. We found that surveyors were more likely to underestimate bird heights, potentially influencing collision-risk assessments for wind farm projects. Use of rangefinders may be limited to days with good visibility, but their accuracy can be excellent within equipment limitations. However, suitability of rangefinders for the species or task in question should be verified before application. Further use of rangefinders is recommended for training, assessment of surveyor accuracy and consistency, calibration of visual flight height distributions, or replacement of visual observations where appropriate.

In this exploratory study, we quantify how placing WECs in front of a FOWT could reduce fatigue damage incurred by FOWT mooring cables in long-crested wave conditions. We use SWAN to quantify the WEC-induced sea state modifications and obtain wave spectra at the FOWT location. The spectra are then input into WEC-Sim and MooDy to model the mooring cable behavior. Fatigue analysis with Rainflow Counting is used to quantify the fatigue loading on the mooring cables. Results from this study show a 8% reduction in fatigue damage to mooring cables over the lifetime of the structure. These results indicate that co location could have a beneficial effect on FOWT mooring cable fatigue.

To reassure an environmentally acceptable development, regulatory authorities need to make informed decisions even when evidence and experience are scarce. In this study Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) has been applied on a wind farm project in Kattegat, proposed within a spawning ground for the Kattegat cod, a threatened population of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L). Six stressors with potential impacts on cod and related to wind farms were investigated. Three of them - extreme noise from pile driving, noise from vessels, and disturbances due to cable-trenching - are related to the construction phase, while lubricant spills and noise from turbines together with electric fields from cables are related to the operation phase. The ecological risk was derived from the combined likelihood and magnitude of potential adverse effects from stressors to the cod population using a weight-of-evidence (WOE) ranking procedure. Available evidence was evaluated based on its reliability, and contradictory arguments were balanced against each other using evidence maps. The option of performing hazardous construction events (e.g. pile-driving) outside biologically sensitive periods was incorporated in the assessment. It was shown that the construction of the wind farm poses a high risk to cod, as defined by the ranked and combined likelihoods and magnitudes of adverse effects. However by avoiding particular construction events during the cod recruitment period ecological risks can be significantly reduced. Specifically for this case, ecological risks are reduced from high to low by avoiding pile-driving from December through June, which confirms previous indications that pile-driving is the most ecologically hazardous activity of offshore wind power development. Additional risk reduction is achieved by avoiding cable trenching from January through May. The study thus illustrates the effectiveness of time-planning for risk reduction. Importantly, the study illustrates how combined ERA and WOE methods can be valuable for handling uncertainties of environmental impacts within offshore industrial development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyzed the flight trajectories of soaring migrant birds passing the La Venta II wind farm during the two migratory seasons of 2011, to determine whether an avoidance pattern existed or not. We recorded three polar coordinates for the flight path of migrating soaring birds that were detected using marine radar, plotted the flight trajectories and estimated the number of trajectories that intersected the polygon defined by the wind turbines of La Venta II. Finally, we estimated the actual number of intersections per kilometer and compared this value with the null distributions obtained by running 10,000 simulations of our datasets. The observed number of intersections per kilometer fell within or beyond the lower end of the null distributions in the five models proposed for the fall season and in three of the four models proposed for the spring season. Flight trajectories had a non-random distribution around La Venta II, suggesting a strong avoidance pattern during fall and a possible avoidance pattern during spring. We suggest that a nearby ridgeline plays an important role in this pattern, an issue that may be incorporated into strategies to minimize the potential negative impacts of future wind farms on soaring birds.

A visit by Wintershall staff in 2001 confirmed the presence of at least 3 nests.L8-P is an uninhabited gas-exploitation platform at 53 degrees 38.5'N, 04 degrees 34'E, in 32 m deep water, an area known as the Frisian Front (a separation zone between turbid water of the Southern Bight and clear, saline water of the Central North Sea). No information was received since then and a visit planned for 2004 had to be cancelled. On 22 June 2005, however, a full day was spent on the island and a colony census could be conducted successfully. On eight different locations, with most nests (62.2%) along the east and southeast side of the platform (Fig. 1), 45 apparently occupied nests were found. Of these, 22 nests were empty, eight contained a single egg, and 15 held two eggs. The mean egg size was 55.84 x 39.98 mm, with no difference between single egg and double egg clutches. Samples of guano and nest material were taken, and these suggested that the birds fed mainly on small sandeels Ammodytes spp. and Sprat Sprattus sprattus (calculated fish length 5-15 cm;Table 2). The nests were built of a mixture of natural materials (seaweeds such as Fucus vesiculosus, Euteromorpha spp., Flustra foliacea, and Ascophyllum nodosum) and all kinds of plastics and nylon.Mean clutch size was low, perhaps typical for a newly established colony, but the prospects for this site seem promising, except for a limitation of nest sites. The food situation is likely to be excellent, as previous observations on seabirds in this part of the North Sea have shown. The results show that the birds focussed on natural prey rather than on discards (in sharp contrast with the prey remains of large Larus gulls found on the helicopter deck of the same site.

Birds flight heights greatly influence this risk, yet height estimates are currently available only using methods such as radar- or ship-based observations over limited areas. Bird-borne data-loggers have the potential to provide improved estimates of collision risk and here, we used data from Global Position System (GPS)-loggers and barometric pressure loggers to track the three-dimensional movements of northern gannets rearing chicks at a large colony in south-east Scotland (Bass Rock), located <50 km from several major wind farm developments with recent planning consent. We estimated the foraging ranges and densities of birds at sea, their flight heights during different activities and the spatial variation in height during trips. We then used these data in collision-risk models to explore how the use of different methods to determine flight height affects the predicted risk of birds colliding with turbines. Gannets foraged in and around planned wind farm sites. The probability of flying at collision-risk height was low during commuting between colonies and foraging areas (median height 12 m) but was greater during periods of active foraging (median height 27 m), and we estimated that ~1500 breeding adults from Bass Rock could be killed by collision with wind turbines at two planned sites in the Firth of Forth region each year. This is up to 12 times greater than the potential mortality predicted using other available flight-height estimates. Synthesis and applications: The use of conventional flight-height estimation techniques resulted in large underestimates of the numbers of birds at risk of colliding with wind turbines. Hence, we recommend using GPS and barometric tracking to derive activity-specific and spatially explicit flight heights and collision risks. Our predictions of potential mortality approached levels at which long-term population viability could be threatened, highlighting a need for further data to refine estimates of collision risks and sustainable mortality thresholds. We also advocate raising the minimum permitted clearance of turbine blades at sites with high potential collision risk from 22 to 30 m above sea level.

J,,,,,,,,,Natalie Ruth Hicks,,Functionality and Ecological Connectivity of Man-Made Structures (FuECoMMS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Aug 11 2020,2020,"With the increasing amount of energy-related infrastructure (oil and gas platforms, wind turbines, cables) installed in the North Sea, there is a need to understand the role these man-made structures (MMS) play in the marine ecosystem. Current decommissioning regulations prohibit leaving installations in place in any form, which means complete removal when no longer in production. However, there are significant knowledge gaps on the effect these MMS have on marine ecosystem function. Central to our understanding of MMS on the ecology of the North Sea, is having a better understanding of the background (baseline or equilibrium position) against which changes in ecosystem processes can be assessed. A few recent studies have identified the role of MMS as artificial reef structures, yet little research has examined the effect of MMS on the largest surrounding habitat - the seabed, its associated biodiversity, and the ecosystem services it provides. Shelf sediments, such as those found in the North Sea, are dominated by sandy permeable sediments, and recent research under the NERC Shelf Seas Biogeochemistry programme established that a significant proportion of 'blue carbon' is held in such shelf sediments. These sediments provide a variety of ecosystem services, from biogeochemical cycling of nutrients, carbon and oxygen; biodiversity (macrofauna, microbial); contaminant deposition; habitat provision; and production of inorganic nutrients to support surface water productivity, underpinning marine food webs and commercial fisheries. The presence and installation of MMS provides protection of the seabed from other human activities, such as trawling and dredging, protecting the seabed from physical disturbance and effectively providing an unofficial 'Marine Protected Area' (MPA). The hydrocarbon extraction activity at MMS influences local biodiversity, particularly changing benthic microbial diversity as a response to the presence and concentration of associated contaminants, and these microorganisms play a vital role in degrading the hydrocarbons within the sediments. Whilst the stability of these sediments and their ability to sequester carbon is uncertain, the decommissioning and physical removal of MMS is likely to disrupt these long term carbon stores, and impact on benthic ecosystem processes. Complete removal of MMS, following current Oslo-Paris (OSPAR) regulations could impact on the hydrodynamics and nutrient cycling at a local scale, negatively affecting biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and ecosystem processes in surrounding sediments. Furthermore, the shelf sediments may be exposed to additional hydrocarbon contaminants either via oil seeps/pipeline leaks or resuspension of oily drill cuttings, and their eventual disturbance and wider impact is relatively unknown. The presence and subsequent removal of MMS will therefore not only likely affect the sediment biogeochemistry but also the marine biodiversity and ecosystem function. This project addresses this knowledge gap through novel technologies (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) and environmental DNA 'eDNA', with modelling of environmental data alongside data from industry (INSITE Interactive and our industry partners) to identify the role of MMS on key marine ecosystem processes. We have a strong team of project partners from industry (Shell, Repsol, INEOS, DNV-GL) and stakeholders (Shetland Oil Terminal Advisory Group, SOTEAG; National Subsea Research Initiative, NSRI). This project has significant support from industry and stakeholders, and a Stakeholder Advisory Group will be established to make full use of this. Recent news reports on UK decommissioning decisions have drawn attention other European oil nations on what is environmentally acceptable, thus the outputs of this project are expected to have international interest and direct policy relevance for future decommissioning.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/T010800/1,,,,,,,,University of Essex,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15312887,,

A typical three-phase AC cable consist of three helically-interwound power cores with three polymeric fillers to accomplish a circular circumference over which sheaths and tensile armour layers are applied. The present paper focuses on the mechanical behaviour of a dynamic submarine cable subjected to a combined axial tension, radial pressure and bending load. Particular interest is emphasized on the stick slip behaviour of the helically-interwound power cores. 3D finite element (FE) model has been developed, where the interactions on all layers of the cable are extrinsically taken into account. The stick-slip behaviour of the power cores and the resulting friction stress induced during cable bending can have a large impact on the fatigue life of the dynamic cable. Kinematics of slips between the cable core components resulting from FE simulations will be analyzed and compared to the assumption of fully loxodromic slips typically used in the formulation of analytical model for helically-wound cables. The output of the present analyses will provide a better understanding on the mechanical behaviour of the power cores of dynamic submarine power cables in response to cable bending and provide a basis to verify and develop analytical models that can be used for, e.g. fatigue life assessments.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-5769-4,,,,,,,,,"ABB AB, Corp Res, Vasteras, SwedenABB HV Cables Sweden AB, Karlskrona, SwedenBeslutech AB, Balsta, Sweden",ABB HV Cables Sweden ABBeslutech AB,,,2017-12-27,WOS:000417224900038,,

The report first describes impacts from offshore windfarms on marine mammals and defines the spatial and temporal scope of investigations in order to detect impacts on marine mammals. Impacts from offshore windfarming occur at very different spatial and temporal scales: Construction work, especially pile driving, may result in short-termed but long ranged impacts, whereas the operation of windfarms is expected to result in local but long-lasting impacts. The report reviews the standard methods used in studies on marine mammals in relation to offshore windfarms. Statistical power of line transect surveys using aircrafts and ships and Static Acoustic Monitoring using T-PODs is analysed from datasets obtained in German studies. Aerial surveys provide an efficient method for multi-species surveys covering rather large areas (2000 km2 ) per survey, which are considered to be sufficient to compare impact and reference areas. In areas where abundance of harbour porpoises are sufficiently high, which is expected to be the case in many UK waters, aerial surveys are useful to measure population size and population changes. Based on datasets in areas of high densities, it is concluded that 30 % changes can be detected by 1-3 surveys. Aerial surveys will provide additional data on other species, however, as either densities (dolphins, whales) or detection rates (seals) are low, no quantitative data can be obtained in restricted areas. Aerial surveys are often restricted by weather conditions and thus suffer from a low temporal resolution. The spatial resolution may not be sufficient to detect small-scaled impacts as expected during the operation of offshore windfarms. Line transect counts from ships may also be used for marine mammal surveys. They have a lower spatial resolution and are even more restricted to suitable weather conditions. Based on datasets in areas of high densities, it is concluded that 30 % changes can also be detected by 1-3 surveys. The efficiency of ship transect surveys can probably be highly improved by towed hydrophones, which record echolocation clicks from porpoises and dolphins. The main advantage of towed hydrophones would be, that it can be used at night and during weather conditions, which do not allow visual surveys. Static Acoustic Monitoring (SAM) using T-PODs or other devices provide excellent data on harbour porpoises and potentially also dolphin species at a high temporal but low spatial resolution. The spatial resolution can be improved by deploying several SAM devices in the area of interest. Statistical analysis from areas with low and high porpoise densities proved that a 30 % change in harbour porpoise presence can be proved with a sample size of 3-11. Other methods, as telemetry tracking, photo-identification and haul-out counts for seals are described. For impact studies in relation to offshore windfarms a BACI (Before-After/Control-Impact) design is generally recommended but recommendations are also given for cases, where no baseline data are available or a BACI may not be possible for other reasons. It is recommended to combine line transect surveys using aircrafts or ships with Static Acoustic Monitoring. An impact study on offshore windfarms should ideally cover two years before construction, the construction period and at least two years of operation. If longer lasting effects are detected, the study during the operational phase should be extended. It is recommended to conduct line transect surveys in monthly intervals. In areas with a marked seasonal occurrence, surveys may be restricted to periods with high abundance, when sufficient data are more likely to be obtained. Continuous recordings of harbour porpoises with SAM are recommended for all areas, where these animals occur in relevant numbers. SAM will provide data which are needed to detect short-termed changes in behaviour and abundance as expected in response to pile driving, but also to detect changes on a much smaller spatial scale as can be detected by other methods as well as long-term changes in response to construction of operation. For seals and dolphins severe problems in assessing the impacts remain, as their behaviour or low densities make it very difficult to obtain enough data for statistical analysis.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-9557501-2-0,,,,,,,,,"Bioconsult SH, Brinckmannstr. 31, 25813, Husum, Germany",,,,2008-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14503017856,,

In addition, the installation process of the whole substructure, consisting of the buckets connected to the jacket, can be carried out in one work step, which increases efficiency. A prototype of the suction bucket jacket was installed in the wind park `Borkum Riffgrund 1' (North Sea) in August 2014. Due to the pre-installed and comprehensive measuring system, it was possible to monitor all installation and operating phases. The data analysis of a storm event show an amplitude and frequency-dependent behaviour of the soil stiffness and the suction bucket foundation without wind turbine. In the frequency range of the first and second eigenfrequency (0.2 Hz < f < 5 Hz), the system behaves linearly. Here, the Frequency Domain Decomposition is used for identification and monitoring. For the lower frequency band (0.05 Hz < f < 0.2 Hz) where higher forces and displacements occur, a non-linear multilayer perceptron is chosen to model the non-linear relations between measurements.

For Steller's Sea Eagles H. pelagicus, however, only one bird is known to have collided with a wind turbine. In order to determine why Steller's Sea Eagles collide with wind turbines much less frequently than White-tailed Eagles, we studied the flight behavior of the two species between 2007 and 2009 in Hokkaido, northern Japan. The altitude of flight was significantly higher for Steller's Sea Eagles than for White-tailed Eagles, which frequently flew at altitudes within the height range for the rotor-swept area of wind turbines (50-100 m). The frequency of flight activity was also much higher for White-tailed Eagles than for Steller's Sea Eagles. These results confirm that White-tailed Eagles are at higher collision risk than Steller's Sea Eagles. The flight altitude of migrating eagles was significantly higher than that of wintering and resident birds. It is suggested that measures should be taken to reduce collision risk primarily for wintering and resident eagles. Since migrating eagles generally fly at lower elevation when landing after their cross-ocean trip, however, they may enter the collision risk zone. Therefore, in areas where wind farms are located along points-of-arrival for migrating eagles, measures should be taken to reduce the collision risk for migrating eagles as well.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,,,1880-1587; 1880-1595,,,,,,,,,,,"Japan Bird Research Association, 1-29-9 Sumiyoshi, Fuchu, 183-0034, Japan",,,,2010-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14803022460,,

The platform design has a great impact on the overall dynamic behaviors of the system. In this study, the dynamic responses of three floating VAWT models under wind excitations were tested in a water tank facility. A three-bladed H-rotor VAWT model with a geometric scale of 1:100 was used and fixed onto three floating platforms inspired by offshore oil rigs and floating wind turbine prototypes. The three platforms, i.e. single-spar, tri-floater, and hepta-spar, represent a deep draft, a strong buoyancy, and a hybrid conceptual model, respectively. The natural frequency of these models has been determined in free-decay tests. In the experiments, six degrees-of-freedom forces/moments were measured in a fixed coordinate setup and the free motion acceleration data were recorded in floating-coordinate tests. Results suggest the mean surging forces are similar for three models, but the mean pitching moments are different due to different floating platform designs. Dynamic loadings are significant for all force/moment components except for the yawing moment. Frequency domain analysis suggests dynamic loadings are dominated by the fundamental rotational frequency and its third harmonic. Despite of these common characteristics, three floating VAWT models show significantly different dynamic loadings and free motion accelerations under the same wind excitation. Due to scaling limitations, the dynamic motion and force data obtained in the present study could not be directly used for full-scale applications. However, the test result reveals the characteristics of fluid-structural interaction of three potential floating VAWT designs, and experimental data could provide validation benchmarks for future reduced-scale computational modeling (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of the models are discussed separately and together to elucidate the combined effects. Overall, all three models suggested relatively weak environmental changes for the mechanisms included in this study, however these are only a subset of all the potential impacts, and a number of assumptions had to be made. Further work is required to address these assumptions and additional mechanisms. All three models suggested most of the changes within the wind turbine array, and small changes up to several tens of km outside the array. Within the array, the acoustic model indicated the most concentrated, spatially repetitive changes to the environment, followed by the SWAN wave model, and the biogeochemical model being the most diffuse. Because of the different spatial scales of the response of the three models, the combined results suggested a spectrum of combinations of environmental changes within the wind turbine array that marine organisms might respond to. The SWAN wave model and the acoustic model suggested a reduction in changes with increasing distance between turbines. The SWAN wave model suggested that the biogeochemical model, because of the inability of its simple wave model to simulate wave propagation, over-estimated the biogeochemical changes by a factor of 2 or more. The biogeochemical model suggested that the benthic system was more sensitive to the environmental changes than the pelagic system. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Support structure designs for such turbines must account for loads due to breaking waves, but predictions from breaking wave models often disagree with each other and with observed behavior. This variability indicates the need for a better understanding of each model's strengths and limitations, especially for dfferent ocean conditions. This work evaluates and improves the accuracy of common breaking wave criteria through comparison to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of breaking waves. The simulated ocean conditions are representative of potential U.S. East Coast offshore wind energy development sites, but the discussion of model accuracy and limitations can be applied to any location with similar ocean conditions. The waves are simulated using CONVERGE, a commercial CFD software that uses a Volume of Fluid (VOF) approach and includes adaptive mesh refinement at the evolving air -water interface. First, the CFD model is validated against experimental data for shoaling and breaking wave surface elevations. Second, 2D simulations of breaking waves are compared to widely -used breaking wave limits (McCowan, Miche, and Goda) for different combinations of wave height, wavelength, water depth, and seafloor slope. Based on these comparisons, the accuracy and limitations of each breaking limit model are discussed.

For the design purpose, the present study was intended to incorporate some important factors of the riser conditions (i.e. bidirectional vibration, free-end condition, and spanwise variation of response amplitude) for investigating its dynamics characteristics. An experimental investigation on time-dependent motion of a flexible free-hanging circular cantilever subjected to uniform cross-flows has been carried out. The free-end condition cantilever has a 34.4 aspect ratio and a low mass ratio of about 1.24. The cylinder freely oscillates in both inline and transverse to the flow. Reynolds number varied from 10,800 to 37,800. The jump phenomenon was found in the inline motion of the cylinder that agrees well with an existing comparable work. At high flow velocities, the 3rd higher harmonic frequencies of the cylinder transverse response became predominant that produce quite different motion characteristics compared to the other existing comparable works with 2-dimensional bottom-end condition. Generally, the results suggested that the flexible free-hanging cantilever generate different vortex wake mode than either, a uniform (a short-rigid flexibly-mounted cylinder) or a linear amplitude variation along the span case (a pivoted cylinder).",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,2337-5779,2338-5502,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Teknol Sepuluh Nopember ITS, Dept Ocean Engn, Surabaya, IndonesiaOsaka Univ Prefecture, Dept Marine Syst Engn, Osaka, Japan",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000215835600002,,

The hybrid foundation consists of a traditional monopile and a wide-shallow bucket. A series of numerical analyses are conducted to investigate its behavior under the static and dynamic loading, considering various loading eccentricities. A traditional monopile with the same steel volume is used as a benchmark. Although the monopile outperforms the hybrid foundation in terms of the ultimate moment capacity under each loading eccentricity, the latter can achieve superior or the same performance with nearly half of the pile length in the design loading range. Moreover, the horizontal load and moment are mainly resisted by the bucket and the single pile in the hybrid foundation respectively. The failure mechanism of both the hybrid foundation and the monopile is excessive rotation. In the rotation angle of 0.05 rad, the rotation center is located at the depth of approximately 0.6-0.75 times and 0.65-0.75 times the pile length for the hybrid foundation and the monopile respectively. The increasing loading eccentricities can lead to increasing moment bearing capacity, increasing initial stiffness and upward movement of the rotation center of the two foundations, while decreasing load sharing ratio of the single pile in the hybrid foundation. Three scenarios are considered in investigating the dynamic loading behavior of the hybrid foundation. Dynamic response results reveal that addition of the bucket to the foundation can restrain the rotation and lateral displacement effectively. The superiority of the hybrid foundation is more obvious under the combined wave and current loading.",,,,,,,,,45,4,0,0,0,0,49,,,0951-8339,1873-4170,,,,,,,,,,"Hohai Univ, Key Lab Coastal Disaster & Def, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R ChinaHohai Univ, Coll Harbour Coastal & Offshore Engn, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R ChinaPowerChina Huadong Engn Corp, Hangzhou 311122, Peoples R China",,,,2020-05-11,WOS:000528602100014,,

Drag varied according to frond size, current velocity and acceleration reaction. Dislodgement of laminarian holdfasts and the forces necessary to break the stipe depended on blade length and surface area. Neither did our measured nor our calculated values of drag exceed those forces, provided the algae had been gown in a current > 1 m s(-1).

In contrast, on far offshore and strictly subtidal locations, such as shipwrecks and rocky reefs, only C. linearis was found. Based on these exploratory observations, we hypothesised that artificial structures that are only subtidal are inhabited exclusively by C. linearis, and never by C. mutica. To test this hypothesis and understand factors driving each species' habitat preferences, habitat suitability models were constructed using generalised additive models, based on samples collected in 2013-2015 from offshore gas platforms, buoys, shipwrecks, and rocky reefs and combined with data from other published and unpublished surveys (2001-2014). The models showed that the presence of C. mutica is explained by the availability of intertidal and floating hard substrates, suspended particulate matter density (SPM), mean annual sea surface temperature, salinity, and current velocity. The C. linearis model included subtidal hard substrates, SPM, salinity, temperature, and current velocity. The modelled distributions showed a significant difference, demonstrating that C. linearis' habitat preference does not fully overlap with that of C. mutica. Thus, the native and alien Caprella species are likely to be able to co-exist in the North Sea.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,11,0,15,,,1798-6540,1818-5487,,,,,,,,,,"IMARES Wageningen UR, Inst Marine Resource & Ecosyst Studies, POB 57, NL-1780 AB Den Helder, NetherlandsWageningen Univ, Chair Grp Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, Droevendaalsesteeg 3a, NL-6708 PD Wageningen, NetherlandsBur Waardenburg, POB 365, NL-4100 AJ Culemborg, NetherlandsRoyal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Operat Directorate Nat Environm, Aquat & Terr Ecol, Marine Ecol & Management Sect, Gulledelle 100, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium",Bur Waardenburg,,,2016-11-09,WOS:000385925200008,,

Three percent of deaths were attributed to wind turbines.Aims To assess the main mortality causes from bird bodies washed ashore near wind turbines built in 1993.Methods Weekly searches were made for bird carcasses to ascertain causes of death. Experiments tested the efficiency of searches, longevity of carcasses, and effects of wind direction on deposition rates.Results In total, 3748 bird carcasses were found, an average of 341 per year. Guillemots formed 24.3% of the total, Kittiwakes 9.7%, Herring Gulls 9.0%, Black-headed Gulls 7.4%, Great Black-backed Gulls 6.4% and Feral Pigeons 11.3%. Each year more carcasses were found in winter than in summer, with a nine-fold variation between winters. About 28.1% of carcasses were classed as starved, and 23.3% as eaten at sea (predation or scavenging).

The mussel cultivation in Germany is based on an extensive on-bottom culture and depends entirely on natural resources for food, spat and space. Due to stakeholder conflicts and a lack of spat availability, mussel farmers tend to move offshore where space is not limited and adequate settlement guaranteed. Newcomers - the offshore wind farmers - are covering large areas in the German Bight which in contrast give the opportunity to use these areas in a multifunctional way by accepting mussel cultivation within the wind farms. This study compiles the basic data for offshore mussel cultivation in close vicinity to a designated offshore wind farm in the open sea of the German Bight and employs different case-scenario calculations to illustrate the impact of changing parameter values on overall profitability or non-profitability of this activity. Primary focus is placed on the production of consumer mussels but seed mussel cultivation is also taken into consideration. We show that production of consumer mussels with longline technology is sufficiently profitable even under the assumption of substantial cost increases. This is especially true, if existing capacities could be used. The cultivation of seed mussels depends on the possibility of using existing equipment. A substantial increase of seed mussel prices to at least 0.6, given the main cost categories remaining constant, turns this alternative into substantial profitability. This study concludes with providing some recommendations on how favorable terms or actions could further improve profitability of offshore mussel cultivation.

These obstacles have contributed to perceptions that this essential emerging industry receives disproportionate scrutiny relative to established maritime activities. However, alongside legislated targets to reduce carbon emissions, there are legal obligations to protect, maintain and improve the condition of the marine environment. As the imperative to halt the decline in the condition of the environment increases, so expectations of cumulative impact assessments grow and the risk of consenting delays persists. To investigate how robust current cumulative impact assessment practise is, a novel evaluation framework was developed and applied to Environmental Statements of the world's largest offshore wind farms, currently in United Kingdom waters. The framework was designed to evaluate cumulative impact assessments relative to the information needs of decision-makers tasked with managing cumulative effects. We found that current practise does not meet those needs, that there is dissonance between science and practise, and problematic variability between assessments was observed. Straightforward recommendations for improved practise are provided, which if implemented may ease the perceived regulatory burden by clarifying practise. We also highlight additional steps that could enable project-led cumulative impact assessments to better support regional marine management. The results and recommendations will be of interest to countries worldwide where marine renewable energy is emerging alongside ecosystem-approach and marine spatial planning aspirations.",,,,,,,,,42,1,0,0,11,0,45,,,1364-0321,1879-0690,,,,,,,,,,"Cranfield Univ, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, EnglandCtr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci Cefas, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 OHT, Suffolk, EnglandCape Eleuthera Inst, Queens Highway, Eleuthera, Bahamas",Cape Eleuthera Inst,,,2018-01-30,WOS:000418574800025,,

In the ocean environment, in addition to threats related to scour of the foundation, offshore monopiles of wind turbines also are subjected to lateral vibrations induced by waves and winds. Over the past decades, the scour process induced by flow and pile-soil interactions has been independently investigated by researchers from the fields of hydraulic/coastal engineering and soil mechanics, respectively. Very few studies can be found in the published literature on lateral vibration effects on scour at monopile foundations. The objective of this experimental study is to improve understanding of the mechanics of current-induced scour at monopiles subjected to lateral vibrations with a non cohesive bed. When compared to a non-vibrating monopile, the results show that scouring around its vibrating counterpart is comparatively faster during the first few hours of the test. This is primarily due to soil densification and the subsidence process induced by monopile-seabed interactions. Increasing both the frequency and amplitude of the monopile vibration would decrease the equilibrium scour depths and scour hole slopes. The reduction of equilibrium scour depth likely is due to the effect of sediment ratcheting motions on the surface of the scour hole. An empirical dimensionless equation is proposed to estimate equilibrium scour depth at monopiles subjected to lateral vibrations.",,,,,,,,,47,12,0,0,2,0,55,,,0378-3839,1872-7379,,,,,,,,,,"Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaNanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore 639798, SingaporeUniv Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",,,,2019-02-15,WOS:000457658300002,,

Since then, approximately 60% of the offshore oil/gas production structures used globally have been erected in the GOM to support the production of energy resources. The shallow, shelf and shelf edge waters of the Gulf of Mexico have reached or are rapidly approaching production maturity, requiring that the fixed structures used to support energy production be removed or otherwise disposed of by suitable means. The use of energetic materials has been determined to be a safe, efficient and cost effective technology to remove fixed offshore structures whose service life has been exceeded.However, the use of explosives in an underwater environment raises concerns about safe loading, transport, and use of explosives offshore and the environmental impact of submerged explosions. Agencies of the federal and state governments active in management and oversight of the GOM have established policies concerning offshore explosive operations to promote safety and minimize the impact on the environment.This paper will describe the various types of offshore rig removal operations involving explosives, the marine habitat, underwater blast effects and their mitigation, a summary of the regulatory agencies with oversight over such operations, and a description of the codes required to be followed when conducting these operations. The alternative to the complete removal of platforms and structures for onshore disassembly such as the Rigs-to-Reefs program is discussed also. It should be noted that the management of GOM oil and gas lease abandonment is being observed by concerned organizations in other offshore regions such as the North Sea to determine how to manage their own rig removal or decommissioning programs.

Under small- and moderate-amplitude loads, that is, 20% and 40% of lateral bearing capacity, respectively, loading along the diagonal direction had a more pronounced impact on increasing the accumulative displacement and unloading stiffness of the foundation than along the orthogonal direction. Both suggest less favorable conditions for the former regarding the serviceability of OWTs. Throughout the loading, a progressive transfer of the lateral load carried by the upwind piles to the downwind ones was identified and a degradation factor model was derived based on cyclic p-y curves to assess the cyclic lateral pile-soil interactions of TPJ foundations in preliminary design. The complementary two-way loading test showed less hysteresis and degradation behavior of the soil than the one-way test, and hence limited accumulative displacement of the TPJ despite the load being applied in an asymmetrical form.

This is especially so when a strategic planning process is put in place for marine areas, in which offshore wind is treated as part of the overall configuration of marine interests, so that adjustments can be made in the interests of wind energy.

Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied to a data set of 2 macroinfauna size fractions retained on 0.5 and 2 mm sieves, in conjunction with levels of metals, oil hydrocarbons and a range of natural sediment variables.

The purpose of the workshop was to review new and existing evidence of seabird displacement from OWFs. The workshop considered current assessment approaches, both in the UK and abroad, with the aim of developing a more co-ordinated UK assessment approach. The ultimate aim was to identify an agreed best practice Displacement Assessment Framework (DAF) or at least the key components that might feed into such an approach. The workshop, involving 35 participants from eight European countries, comprised a series of short presentations (providing background evidence/methods to inform later discussions), group discussion work and plenary sessions. Participants were tasked with answering a number of questions relating to the evidence underpinning, processes required, and methods feeding into a future DAF. Participants concluded there was likely a need for both short and long-term solutions to the DAF. The short-term to meet immediate needs of projects currently going through (or shortly entering) the consenting process, the longer-term to allow time to address substantial evidence gaps on the true impact of displacement, as well as develop more robust methods to feed into the DAF. Ultimately, these two initially parallel approaches would likely merge into a single, best-practice approach. It was also felt important to consider combined impacts' (i. e. displacement, barrier and collisions), Cumulative Impacts Assessment (CIA) and transboundary impacts in any future framework. For any future DAF to be effective, participants noted the need for common analytical approaches, better/more empirical evidence and clearer guidance. There appeared to be consensus on the benefits of continuing to use some form of 'Matrix Approach'1, at least in the short-term, but that further work was required to appropriately integrate species-specific variation in displacement levels/ impacts, seasonal life history stage (e. g. breeding adult, juvenile, non-breeder), and particularly demographic rates (survival and productivity) into the Matrix Approach. Also that it might be helpful to add aspects of ' habitat quality' (or 'habitat importance') to the Matrix Approach, but that this might have to be a medium-term aim. The group felt there was potential for integrating some elements of the ' Displacement as Habitat Loss Approach' into a future DAF, but that this was likely to be part of a medium or long-term approach. As assessment methods continue to improve over time, individual/agentbased models were thought likely to develop and be more routinely used in any future DAF. For the development of a short-term DAF, it was broadly felt there should be 3 key stages: (1) screening (using expert elicitation to inform/chose parameters), (2) a refined Matrix Approach, and (3) analyses of the population consequences. Finally, there was a recommendation that displacement/abundance data from individual projects must be comparable, with a clear record of methods used, decisions made and outcomes from each assessment, readily available.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-10-29,ZOOREC:ZOOR15111076941,,

Piston rods made of carbon, quenched and tempered (QT) and stainless steels are frequently surface coated with methods such as thermal spraying, hard chrome plating, and overlay welding. Unfortunately, several premature failures have been reported particularly in marine applications due to insufficient coating properties. Laser cladding has recently drawn lot of attention in this field due to high coating quality and significant improvements in productivity. In this study, several potential Fe-, Ni-, and Co-based alloys were laser clad on carbon and QT steels. Their corrosion and mechanical performances were explored in long-term salt spray, immersion, hardness, abrasive wear, and four-point bending fatigue tests. Most of the laser coatings outperformed hard chrome in corrosion properties, but hardness values were somewhat lower. In single point abrasion tests (scratch tests), the hardest laser coatings, however, outperformed hard chrome due to brittle nature of hard chrome layers. Postmachining induced significant superficial hardness increases in laser coatings, which was the main reason for good wear performance. Fatigue performance was strongly dependent on material pairs, presence of cladding defects, and applied loads.

This is because light pre-tension requirements in the line may be insufficient to prevent the mooring lines from being exposed to wave motion induced slack and shock events.In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of a semi submersible based FOWT exposed to a 100-year storm condition, based on model test data and numerical simulations of well-known industry standard software. The data was obtained from a 1/50th-scale FOWT with the wind turbine modeled after the NREL 5MW wind turbine. The software, OrcaFlex, was used for numerical simulations of the mooring system. NREL's FAST software was coupled to OrcaFlex to obtain aerodynamic loads along with hydrodynamic load for FOWT analyses. The numerical simulation of the moored FOWT in a 3-hour storm was executed in both the frequency domain and the time-domain to determine the dynamic behavior of the platform and mooring system, respectively. Snap type impact events were observed in both test data and numerical simulation. Tension maxima were fitted into extreme value distributions and comparisons are made between simulated and measured data. It is seen that snap events follow a different exceedance probability distribution compared to the cycle-to-cycle tension maxima.",,,,,"34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015","Amer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivAmer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","St John's, CANADASt John's, CANADA",10,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,,,978-0-7918-5657-4,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maine, Dept Mech Engn, Orono, ME 04469 USAMaine Marine Composites LLC, Portland, ME 04101 USA",Maine Marine Composites LLC,,,2016-09-02,WOS:000379793600050,,

The distribution of Tubastraea is essentially tropical and its presence in the Canary Islands represents the northern-most record of the species in the Eastern Atlantic, breaking into a subtropical area. For Oculina, this new record constitutes its first occurrence of in the Eastern Atlantic. Both species have been introduced through the 'Las Palmas de Gran Canaria' harbor; Tubastraea has also been introduced through the 'Santa Cruz de Tenerife' harbor. It is clear that sea transport of large oil platforms would be the introduction pathway or vector. High density populations of Tubastraea have been found in one of the docks of the 'Las Palmas' harbor and on artificial substratum of the 'Santa Cruz de Tenerife' harbor; its rapid spread beyond the harbor area has also been confirmed in Gran Canaria. It can already be frequently spotted in a locality some 11 km away from the harbor and is present in another area located around 30 km south-east from the harbor. Available data allow us to initially identify it specifically as T coccinea, although there is a certain degree of confusion in the group's taxonomy. The high invasive capacity of this species and its being an integral part of oil platform fouling are well-known. The increased temperature caused by climate change appears to have enabled colonization and spread of Tubastraea, a thermophilic species. The morphology type of Oculina corresponds to that of O. patagonica, a coral which is deemed to have been introduced in the Mediterranean and to be invasive, but whose origin and taxonomic status are rather uncertain. The recorded presence of this coral is still limited to the 'Las Palmas de Gran Canaria' harbor area.

OSPAR and Norwegian national legislation contain provisions that allow for the creation of artificial reefs providing they do not hinder other users and do not cause significant pollution. More generally, the creation of sizeable artificial reefs using redundant offshore steel structures is only sensible if positive impacts outweigh negative impacts. At an early stage in the cessation process, we carried out an impact assessment to identify factors that would present special environmental or socio-economic risks or benefits. Thirty-nine impacts, positive and negative, were identified and grouped under the following headings: exploitable fish stocks (8); local biota (7); sediments (4); water column (2); energy and emissions (2); socio-economics (10); other (6). Techniques by which to estimate their likely severity in general and the potential for their reduction (negative impacts) or maximization (positive impacts) are summarized. Semi-quantitative severity scores for all impacts identified were assigned to each of 11 reef-creation options. These were totalled and the options were then ranked accordingly. From an environmental and ecological (including commercial fish stocks) perspective, the results indicate that reef use for protection would be a better option than use for commercial fishing, although differences between the two were not large. The rank order did not discriminate among four of the suggested reef locations. However, toppling in situ was clearly identified as the worst scenario, whereas reef creation at a relatively clean site offered the most promising perspective.",,,,,7th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and related Aquatic Habitats7th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and related Aquatic Habitats,"OCT 07-11, 1999OCT 07-11, 1999",ICES; Italian Soc Marine Biol; European Artificial Reef Res Network; Sanremo Congressi Turismo; Univ Geona; Phillips Petr; European Commiss; US Natl Marine Fisheries ServICES; Italian Soc Marine Biol; European Artificial Reef Res Network; Sanremo Congressi Turismo; Univ Geona; Phillips Petr; European Commiss; US Natl Marine Fisheries Serv,"SAN REMO, ITALYSAN REMO, ITALY",30,1,0,0,17,0,33,,,1054-3139,,,,,,,,,,,"RF Rogaland Res, N-4006 Stavanger, NorwayDames & Moore Norway, N-4006 Stavanger, Norway",RF Rogaland ResDames & Moore Norway,,,2002-10-01,WOS:000179243500048,,

There may be more than 100 000 shipwrecks in the Baltic Sea, however to date, their effects on biodiversity by the introduction of large hard substrates in this typically low-evenness, species-poor ecosystem have received little attention. This study compared separately macrobenthic assemblages found on three different objects (an old torpedo house, a former submarine and a minesweeper) lying at various depths (2-21 m) in Puck Bay (the Gulf of Gdansk, Baltic Sea), and corresponding assemblages in soft sediments from their close (5 m away) and far vicinity (50 m away). A total of 26 taxa of macrobenthic algae, vascular plants and fauna were recorded. Nineteen species were found directly on the study objects. Nine species among them were only found on the submerged objects but none was substrate specific. At two locations clear differences in the assemblage structure between seabed in the close proximity of submerged objects and the seabed located farther apart were noted. Higher species richness, abundance and diversity (measured as Shannon-Wiener H') was recorded only in the location of the deepest object. Its high similarity (both in terms of the assemblage structure and S, N, H') with the closest neighbouring sediments may indicate a direct impact of the object on the surrounding seabed. The submerged objects generally supported a two - three times higher number of species and a similar to 25 times higher number of individuals (but not diversity) than the soft bottom in the vicinity. The shallowest object lying within the euphotic zone hosted the most species rich (on avg. 10 species/144 cm(2)) and abundant (on avg. 379 ind./144 cm(2)) assemblages. Differences in the assemblage structure found between different objects are most likely associated with depth related environmental variables.

This paper presents the findings of the formulation of the reefing viability index to recognize an offshore region that can be used for R2R projects within the South China Sea.

Coral connectivity and spawning behaviour were studied to determine the possible source of coral seedling released during the spawning season, twice a year. A geographic reef viability index was established consisting of seven parameters which are coral larval density, pelagic larval length, sea currents, temperature, chlorophyll-a, depth, and substrate availability. The ocean hydrodynamic model was designed to resemble the pattern of larval scattering. By using the simulations and rankings, there were 95 (21%) sites which could probably be used for in situ reefing, whereas 358 (79%) sites were likely ideal for ex situ reefing.

The proximate composition (carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) differed significantly between liver and muscle tissue but not between fish species or between their potential prey species. Atlantic cod showed to consume more energy than pouting. The latter had a higher overall energy reserve and can theoretically survive twice as long on the available energy than cod. In autumn, both fish species could survive longer on their energy than in spring. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were found in high concentrations in fish liver.

However, information on the distribution of these platforms over vast areas of the sea is extremely poor partly because of business secrecy, national interests including security, and partly from bureaucratic inertia. Until recently, the automatic and accurate identification of platforms using optical imagery was challenging due to their subtle characteristics (i.e., low contrast and small size) and prevalent cloud cover. The Landsat-8 satellite, with its increasing Operational Land Imager (OLI) dataset with uniform quality and global coverage, may assist researchers in assessing the worldwide distribution of offshore platforms. Here we describe an automated method, based on time-series of OLI imagery, for extracting offshore platforms (AMEOP) which addresses the aforementioned problems. Specifically, two strategies (time-series and multi-refinement) were designed to address the challenges presented by heavy cloud cover over the sea. Three features documented in the OLI imagery time-series (contextual feature, and position- and size-invariance) were used to accurately discriminate offshore platforms from false positives. The AMEOP was applied to the Gulf of Thailand and 370 offshore platforms were automatically identified using 198 OLI images. Validation using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and Chinese high-resolution satellite imagery demonstrated an omission error of 3.8% and a commission error below 1.0%. The AMEOP was also successfully extended to the Persian Gulf and northern Gulf of Mexico, 2346 and 2411 offshore platforms were respectively identified. We believe that the methodology presented herein provides a robust and cost-effective technique for improving the identification of offshore platforms over large areas of the sea; and that the accumulation of OLI data, together with the SAR images, has great potential for mapping and tracking of offshore platforms on a global scale, as well as for providing an early warning of oil spills around platforms and the improved estimation of their greenhouse gas emissions.

Unpublished Report, U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, 1997, 10pp). Observed and simulated tracks showed that likely coral dispersal is driven by five circulation modes. Mode 1 is a cyclonic motion reaching the Texas shelf and possible cyclonic motion along the shelf toward Mexico. Mode 2 is an entrainment by offshore eddies causing likely larval transport into deep water (> 200 m). Mode 3 consists of a continuous eastward movement that reaches 87.5 degreesW. Mode 4 consists of recirculating hows over or near the FGB. Mode 5 is a cross-basin transport that ends near the Florida Keys in 50-60 days. Modes 1 and 4 can bring larvae back to the FGB within 24-30 days after spawning creating conditions for self-seeding. Offshore eddies near the FGB, Modes 2 and 5, generate offshore transport that can carry coral larvae to reefs in Mexico and Florida. Only similar to 43% of the drifters leave the northwestern Gulf shelf, which implies that most coral larvae can remain on the shelf through Modes I, 3, and 4. Mode 3 suggests eastward larval dispersal and under influence of the Mississippi River plume where they can be adversely affected by low salinity, low temperature, and high sedimentation which limit recruitment on oil and gas platforms. possible effects of hurricanes on larval dispersal include reduced travel time, considerable displacements, and physical damage by strong turbulence. Nineteen outer shelf banks were contacted by actual and simulated drifter tracks, but only 10 are suitable for coral larvae settlement given the substrate and crest depth. These 10 banks could represent a doubling of reef area relative to the FGB, i.e., 5.35 km(2) shallower than 55 m, if successfully colonized by coral larvae. Drifter tracks also contacted 129 major oil and gas fixed platforms. Potential larvae recruitment by these contacts could increase the reef area in the northwestern Gulf by 38% compared to the FGB, and support eastward propagation of corals. A majority of actual and simulated drifter contacts occurs within 40 km of the FGB; contacts increased at 70 km and beyond 150 km from the FGB. This contact distribution suggest a high potential for self-seeding, and connectivity of Gulf reefs at long time scales.

The installation and operation of these devices can result in conflicts with wildlife. In the marine environment, mammals may avoid wind farms that are under construction or operating. Such avoidance may lead to more time spent travelling or displacement from key habitats. A paucity of data on at-sea movements of marine mammals around wind farms limits our understanding of the nature of their potential impacts. Here, we present the results of a telemetry study on harbour seals Phoca vitulina in The Wash, south-east England, an area where wind farms are being constructed using impact pile driving. We investigated whether seals avoid wind farms during operation, construction in its entirety, or during piling activity. The study was carried out using historical telemetry data collected prior to any wind farm development and telemetry data collected in 2012 during the construction of one wind farm and the operation of another. Within an operational wind farm, there was a close-to-significant increase in seal usage compared to prior to wind farm development. However, the wind farm was at the edge of a large area of increased usage, so the presence of the wind farm was unlikely to be the cause. There was no significant displacement during construction as a whole. However, during piling, seal usage (abundance) was significantly reduced up to 25km from the piling activity; within 25km of the centre of the wind farm, there was a 19 to 83% (95% confidence intervals) decrease in usage compared to during breaks in piling, equating to a mean estimated displacement of 440 individuals. This amounts to significant displacement starting from predicted received levels of between 166 and 178dB re 1Pa((p-p)). Displacement was limited to piling activity; within 2h of cessation of pile driving, seals were distributed as per the non-piling scenario.Synthesis and applications. Our spatial and temporal quantification of avoidance of wind farms by harbour seals is critical to reduce uncertainty and increase robustness in environmental impact assessments of future developments. Specifically, the results will allow policymakers to produce industry guidance on the likelihood of displacement of seals in response to pile driving; the relationship between sound levels and avoidance rates; and the duration of any avoidance, thus allowing far more accurate environmental assessments to be carried out during the consenting process. Further, our results can be used to inform mitigation strategies in terms of both the sound levels likely to cause displacement and what temporal patterns of piling would minimize the magnitude of the energetic impacts of displacement.Our spatial and temporal quantification of avoidance of wind farms by harbour seals is critical to reduce uncertainty and increase robustness in environmental impact assessments of future developments.

However, the necessary requirements mostly reflect issues of nature conservation: It must be ensured that neither protected areas/habitats nor protected species suffer from significant adverse impacts; they have to remain in a favourable conservation status. In view of uncertainties concerning the effects caused by ocean energy systems, Environmental Impact Studies are of great relevance when examining whether the installation fulfils the requirements of permissibility. The German Federal Maritime and eHydrographic Agency (BSH) has developed a detailed Standard for the Environmental Impact Assessment on Offshore Wind Farms which might be useful for ocean energy systems as well. Within the coastal zone, the installations would be permissible if it is ensured that environmental goods are not significantly affected; this needs to be decided on a case by case basis. Within the EEZ, the installations are permissible if they do not endanger the maritime environment. This suggests that the precautionary principle is not applicable. However, it has to be taken into account as far as species or habitats protected under European Directives are concerned. As a rule, permissibility of maritime installations is achieved by a multitude of collateral clauses to the actual permission, by stipulating certain requirements that help sparing the maritime environment. If in spite of such collateral clauses there are still significant adverse effects, it is necessary to obtain an exemption. Still, the favourable conservation status of habitats and species may not be compromised, and an imperative reason of overriding public interest is needed. Only here, clime protection, as a justification for the exemption, can be relevant. For offshore wind farms, BSH has developed a consolidated permission practice which might be partly - transferable to the permission of ocean energy systems.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0043-0978,,,,,,,,,,,"Kuhbier Rechtsanwalte, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany",Kuhbier Rechtsanwalte,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000264646000007,,

Artificial reefs surveyed were comprised of three types: concrete structures, rig jackets, and decommissioned ships. All reefs were surveyed using vertical long line ( VLL), fish traps, and Adaptive Resolution Imaging Sonar (ARIS 1800). Mean fish abundance did not significantly differ using VLL [1.7 ind set(-1) (SD 2.2)] among the three reef types.

Pile driving sounds may affect the behavior of fish. Acoustic dose-behavioral response relationships were determined for sea bass in a pool exposed for 20 min to pile driving sounds at seven mean received root mean-square sound pressure levels [SPLrms; range: 130-166 dB re 1 mu Pa; single strike sound exposure level (SELSS) range: 122-158; 6 dB steps]. Initial responses (sudden, short-lived changes in swimming speed and direction) and sustained responses (changes in school cohesion, swimming depth, and speed) were quantified. The 50% initial response threshold occurred at an SELSS of 131 dB re 1 1 mu Pa-2 s for 31 cm fish and 141 dB re 1 mu pa(2) s for 44 cm fish; the small fish thus reacted to lower SELSS than the large fish. Analysis showed that there is no evidence, even at the highest sound level, for any consistent sustained response to sound exposure by the study animals. If wild sea bass are exposed to pile driving sounds at the levels used in the present study, there are unlikely to be any adverse effects on their ecology, because the initial responses after the onset of the piling sound observed in this study were short-lived.

The potential interference generated by the scattering characteristics of wind turbines on radar systems is considered a significant issue and has received a lot of attention from the research community and industry alike. However, due to the geometrical complexity of the turbine structure and its enormous electrical size at radar frequencies, the study and modelling of the radar scattering presented a substantial challenge to the research community. The use of commercial Computational Electromagnetic (CEM) tools and other full-wave solvers was limited to a small number of predefined turbine orientations due to the inherent requirement of supercomputing environment or extended modelling runtimes. To accommodate for the growth in demand for renewable energy, larger wind farms are being planned for deployment further offshore -in deeper waters and less favourable seabed conditions. Floating foundations are being widely proposed to reduce costs and enable more rapid growth of offshore wind turbines. Future wind developments (Such as Hornsea Project Two and Three) included floating foundations within their Design Envelope. Some of these projects are located near a number of key shipping routes as well as offshore O&G platforms with REWS installations. To date, the effects of floating foundation on the operation and efficiency of navigational and safety radar systems operating near or within the wind farm is currently largely unknown. Large floating wind turbines will have unique scattering characteristics due to its size, construction materials, vibration profile and movements under wind loading and adverse weather/sea conditions. Floating turbines are likely to dramatically change the radar cross section and its dynamics and consequently impact radar systems.This project will study the effects of wind turbines mounted on floating foundations on offshore radar operations. The project will develop radar scattering models for the floating foundations and account for important parameters such as geometry, materials and platform movement under adverse weather conditions. This project will build on the recently awarded Supergen funding to measure and model the radar scattering from the large 7MW turbine managed by ORE Catapult. The project will analyse the measured data from the ORE Catapult turbine as well as the large dataset of wind farm/radar measurements made available to the University of Manchester by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in South Africa to further develop the existing turbine models and integrate them with the new models of the floating foundations. The analysis, verification and integration of measurements with the modelling capabilities will give a good representation of future offshore turbine. This will then be used to model the static radar returns and Doppler signature generated from the turbines under typical and adverse conditions for safety critical radar operations such as navigation under poor visibility, search and rescue efforts and REWS for collision prevention with offshore O&G assets.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/S012141/1,,,,,,,,University of Manchester,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15317426,,

This study characterised the environmental risk posed by the cuttings pile at the North West Hutton (NWH) oil platform. Data on the drilling fluids and chemical products used over the platform's drilling history were transferred from archived well reports into a custom database, to which were added toxicological and safety data. Although the database contained many gaps, it established that only seven chemical products used at NWH were not in the lowest category of the Offshore Chemicals Notification Scheme, and were used in only small quantities. The study therefore supports the view that the main environmental risk posed by cuttings piles comes from hydrocarbon contamination. The (dated) well records could help future core sampling to be targeted at specific locations in the cuttings piles. Data from many platforms could also be pooled to determine generic 'discharge profiles.'

Since 21% of piping failures are caused by vibration induced fatigue (VIF), an accurate remnant fatigue life (RFL) assessment has the potential to minimize the chances of HCR from an operating piping system. BS-7910 gives two possible approaches for performing a RFL assessment: the S-N curve approach and the fracture mechanics (FM) approach. Since there are large number of uncertainties (such as uncertainty due to the crack growth model, future loading, material and geometric properties, etc.) involved in the RFL calculation process, therefore it is vital to consider the aforementioned sources of uncertainty in order to arrive at an accurate RFL estimate. Nevertheless, BS-7910 provides limited guidance on how to handle uncertainty in RFL assessment. The most common way of dealing with the aforementioned uncertainty is to evaluate RFL probabilistically. This manuscript thus explains the procedure of the probabilistic RFL assessment of offshore topside piping, with an emphasis on uncertainty quantification, propagation and management. Uncertainty quantification handles the identification and characterization of the different sources of uncertainty that may influence the future behavior of the piping component and, in turn, the RFL estimate. Thereafter, uncertainty propagation employs the formerly quantified uncertainties and utilizes the aforementioned information to estimate the RFL. Finally, uncertainty management deals with performing sensitivity analysis to find the individual contributors to uncertainty in the estimated RFL. A numerical case study illustrating the deterministic and probabilistic RFL assessment of topside piping is presented. Afterwards, probabilistically predicted RFL is used to demonstrate the calculation of an inspection interval. Finally, the implications of probabilistically estimated RFL on HCR from process piping is discussed. (C) 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The research team conducted axial compression tests on seven specimens, collected a wide range of experimental results to establish a database, and finally compared the standard calculation results with the experimental results. The study indicates that the axial strength of grouted connections predicted by different methods is distinct.

For this purpose, we propose a novel neural network observer-based optimal control (NOPC) scheme to tackle unlcnown dynamics and disturbances, nonlinear effects, and non-symmetric control input saturation constraints. Accordingly, the neural network (NN) structure addresses the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation and forms an optimal control signal remaining in the saturation bounds. The Lyapunov theory guarantees the Ultimately Uniformly Boundedness (UUB) of all signals of the closed-loop system.

This approach often results in large stone sizes and high scour protection costs. Therefore, a dynamic approach can be an interesting alternative. Such a dynamic design can be achieved by decreasing the armour stone size allowing movement of the stones and increasing the armour layer thickness to prevent filter layer exposure. A physical test program was conducted to investigate the feasibility and behaviour of such a dynamically stable scour protection. In this model, a monopile foundation exposed to typical North Sea combinations of unidirectional currents and waves was reproduced in a wave flume. The program included a number of test series each with different water depths. In each test series, the armour layer stone size and the armour layer thickness were varied, in order to obtain a reshaping scour protection, without filter material exposure. Damage and failure were assessed both visually and using a 3D-laser profiler. Because previous works on damage numbers of rock armour layer scour protections mainly focus on static design, a new damage number was introduced and compared to the visual observation. This allowed the definition of a 'dynamic area' between static design and failure. Scour pit development in time and equilibrium profiling were also analyzed. The results of the tests showed that the concept of a dynamically stable scour protection is feasible.",,,,,"33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 08-13, 2014JUN 08-13, 2014","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn Div","San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,,,978-0-7918-4541-7,,,,,,,,,"IMDC, Antwerp, BelgiumHR Wallingford, Wallingford, Oxon, EnglandFEUP, Oporto, PortugalUniv Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",IMDC,,,2014-01-01,WOS:000363495000026,,

However, the quantitative description of their dynamic behavior is extremely challenging, since it depends on the coupled effects of turbine aerodynamics, control system, hull hydrodynamics and mooring dynamics. In this context, hydrodynamic damping is a major source of uncertainty, particularly for relatively slender structures, such as spars. The aim of the present paper is to provide quantitative estimations of hydrodynamic damping ratios, natural frequencies and response spectra of the six rigid body motions of a spar FOWT under a wide range of wave conditions, including wind-generated sea states, swells and mixed seas. To this aim, the results of an open-sea experiment on a 1:30 model of OC3-Hywind spar in parked rotor conditions, carried out at the Natural Ocean Engineering Laboratory (NOEL) of Reggio Calabria (Italy), are analyzed and discussed. The above mentioned dynamic properties of the model are estimated through the spectral analysis of the rigid body motion time series collected during the experiment, classified depending on the input wave conditions. As a result, quantitative estimations of the dynamic properties of the model are provided, which can be used as input values for numerical models of the full-scale structure. Hydrodynamic damping ratios are estimated, including their variability depending on sea conditions, due to nonlinearity. Also, motion response spectra obtained for wind generated waves can be easily scaled-up to achieve a reasonable representation of the full-scale structure response under a range of relevant design conditions. Finally, additional information about nonlinear effects, coupling between degrees of freedom and close-to-resonance behavior of the model are drawn and commented.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,0,13,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Mediterranea Univ, NOEL, Reggio Di Calabria, ItalyIndian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Ocean Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",,,,2019-09-09,WOS:000482523300022,,

Our methodology generated a spatial map of Red Snapper at a 10-km(2) grid resolution that is consistent with existing knowledge of the species: Red Snapper occurred in relatively high abundances at depths of 50-90 m along the coasts of Texas and Louisiana and in smaller, patchy hot spots at a variety of depths along the Alabama coast and the west Florida shelf. Red Snapper biomass and fecundity estimates were higher for the northwestern GOM than for the northeastern GOM, as the latter area contained mostly smaller, younger individuals. The existence of similar surveys on petroleum platforms and artificial reefs also enabled us to calculate their relative contribution to Red Snapper distribution compared with that of natural habitats. We estimated that for the youngest ageclasses, catch rates were approximately 20 times higher on artificial structures than on natural reefs. Despite the high catch rates observed on artificial structures, they represent only a small fraction of the total area in the northern GOM; thus, we estimated that they held less than 14% of Red Snapper abundance. Because artificial structures-particularly petroleum platforms-attractmostly the youngest individuals, their contribution was even lower in terms of total population biomass (7.8%) or spawning potential (6.4%).

The unique time-series data set provided by this research presented an opportunity to examine how deep-sea benthopelagic fish and epibenthic megafauna populations were affected by an isolated artificial structure and whether animal surveys at this site were biased by aggregation behavior. Counts were taken of benthopelagic grenadiers, Coryphaenoides spp., observed per week as well as numbers of the epibenthic echinoid Echinocrepis rostrata. No significant correlation (r(s) = -0.39; p = 0. 11) was found between the duration of deployment (in weeks) and the average number of Coryphaenoides observed at the site.

Growing awareness of the impact of oil pollution on the marine environment has led, since the late 1960s, to the introduction of measures to reduce or eliminate pollution from shipping and the offshore oil industry. A framework for environmental protection of the North Sea has developed over many decades through international agreements, regional cooperation, and national measures, while education has also played an important role with modern-day sailors being given due training to understand that dumping waste at sea is illegal in many areas, and is harmful to the marine environment. This paper presents data on trends in pollution from ships and oil installations. While significant reductions in oil pollution have been identified over more than two decades, there remain some areas where action is needed to reduce inputs still further, especially from oil and gas platforms.

The risk of seabirds colliding with offshore wind turbines is influenced by flight height, and flight height data usually come from observers on boats, making estimates in daylight in fine weather. GPS tracking provides an alternative and generates flight height information in a range of conditions, but the raw data have associated error. Here, we present a novel analytical solution for accommodating GPS error. We use Bayesian state-space models to describe the flight height distributions and the error in altitude measured by GPS for lesser black-backed gulls and great skuas, tracked throughout the breeding season. We also examine how location and light levels influence flight height. Lesser black-backed gulls flew lower by night than by day, indicating that this species would be less likely to encounter turbine blades at night, when birds ability to detect and avoid them might be reduced. Gulls flew highest over land and lowest near the coast. For great skuas, no significant relationships were found between flight height, time of day and location. We consider four collision risk windows, corresponding to the airspace swept by rotor blades for different offshore wind turbine designs. We found the highest proportion of birds at risk for a 22-250 m turbine (up to 9% for great skuas and 34% for lesser black-backed gulls) and the lowest for a 30-258 m turbine. Our results suggest lesser black-backed gulls are at greater risk of collision than great skuas, especially by day. Synthesis and applications. Our novel modelling approach is an effective way of resolving the error associated with GPS tracking data. We demonstrate its use on GPS measurements of altitude, generating important information on how breeding seabirds use their environment. This approach and the associated data also provide information to improve avian collision risk assessments for offshore wind farms. Our modelling approach could be applied to other GPS data sets to help manage the ecological needs of seabirds and other species at a time when the pressures on the marine environment are growing.

A baseline model with no wind farms accurately represented the status of a sample of tracked gannets at the end of the 90-day chick-rearing period, and the behaviour-time budget was similar to that of tracked gannets.5. Model simulations in the presence of wind farms indicated that installations should have little impact on the gannet population, when either avoidance behaviour or collision risk scenarios were simulated. Furthermore, wind farms would need to be ten times larger or in more highly used areas in order to have population-level impacts on Alderney's gannets.6. Synthesis and applications. Our spatially explicit individual-based models (IBM) highlight that it is vital to know the colony-specific foraging grounds of seabirds that may be impacted, when identifying potential wind farm sites, in order to account for cumulative impacts from multiple sites. Avoiding areas highly used for foraging and commuting, and avoiding large-scale developments should be effective in limiting gannet mortality as a result of collision, competition and energy expenditure. Our IBM provides a robust approach which can be adapted for other seabird populations or to predict the impacts from other types of spatial change in the marine environment.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,18,0,23,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, EnglandBritish Trust Ornithol, Norfolk, VA USAUniv Liverpool, Ctr Engn Sustainabil, Liverpool, Merseyside, EnglandBritish Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, England",British Trust Ornithol,,,2018-03-01,WOS:000424881800005,,

Comparisons of mtDNA sequences of the SwGoMx population with those from conspecifics from 16 sites scattered across its native geographic range show that the SwGoMx population is derived from two of four native lineages: one from the north-west Pacific Ocean, the other from the northern Indian Ocean. Three hypotheses address how this species was introduced to the SwGoMX: (1) aquarium release; (2) borne by cargo-ship; and (3) carried by offshore petroleum platform (petro-platform). The first is unlikely because this species rarely features in the aquarium trade, and N. cyanomos'' traded to the USA from the sole IWP source we are aware of are a misidentified congener, N. taeniurus. The second hypothesis is unlikely because shipping has not been associated with the introduction of alien damselfishes, there is little international shipping between the IWP and the SwGoMx, and voyages between those areas would be lengthy and along environmentally unfavorable routes. Various lines of evidence support the third hypothesis: (i) bio-fouled petro-platforms represent artificial reefs that can sustain large and diverse populations of tropical reef-fishes, including N. cyanomos in the SwGoMx; (ii) relocation of such platforms has been implicated in trans-oceanic introductions leading to establishment of non-native populations of such fishes; and (iii) genetic characteristics of the SwGoMx population indicate that it was established by a large and diverse group of founders drawn from the IWP regions where many petro-platforms currently in the SwGoMx and other Atlantic offshore oilfields originated.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,11,0,13,,,2167-8359,,,,,,,,,,,"Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Naos Marine Lab, Balboa, PanamaUniv Michoacana, Fac Biol, Lab Biol Acuat, Morelia, Michoacan, MexicoUniv Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Escuela Nacl Estudios Super, Lab Nacl Anal & Sintesis Ecol Conservac Recursos, Unidad Morelia, Morelia, Michoacan, MexicoNova Southeastern Univ, Guy Harvey Res Inst, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USAUNAM, Fac Ciencias, Unidad Multidisciplinaria Docencia & Invest Sisal, Sisal, Yucatan, MexicoUniv Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Lab Nacl Resiliencia Costera, Unidad Acad Yucatan, Sisal, Yucatan, MexicoTexas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, Corpus Christi, TX USA",,,,2018-02-19,WOS:000424497900004,29441235,

The discharges of organic and inorganic pollutants, as well as the alteration of the sediment substrate, are among the main impacts associated with these activities. In the present study, we evaluate the response of benthic foraminifera to the activities of three gas platforms in the northwestern Adriatic Sea, with a special focus on the Armida A platform for which extensive geochemical data (organic matter, trace elements, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, other hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds) are available. The response to disturbance is assessed by analyzing the foraminiferal diversity using the traditional morphology-based approach and by 18S rDNA-based metabarcoding. The two methods give congruent results, showing relatively lower foraminiferal diversity and higher dominance values at stations closer to the platforms (< 50 m). The taxonomic compositions of the morphological and metabarcoding datasets are very different, the latter being dominated by monothalamous, mainly soft-walled species. However, compositional changes consistently occur at 50 m from the platform and can be related to variations in sediment grain-size variation and higher concentrations of Ni, Zn, Ba, hydrocarbons and total organic carbon. Additionally, several morphospecies and Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) show strong correlations with distance from the platform and with environmental parameters extracted from BIOENV analysis. Some of these MOTUs have the potential to become new bioindicators, complementing the assemblage of hard-shelled foraminiferal species detected through microscopic analyses. The congruence and complementarity between metabarcoding and morphological approaches support the application of foraminiferal metabarcoding in routine biomonitoring surveys as a reliable, time- and cost-effective methodology to assess the environmental impacts of marine industries.",,,,,,,,,22,1,0,0,17,0,24,,,0160-4120,1873-6750,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dipartimento Sci Pure & Appl, Urbino, ItalyUniv Geneva, Dept Genet & Evolut, CH-8187 Geneva, SwitzerlandUniv Lille, Lab Oceanol & Geosci UMR 8187 LOG CNRS Lille ULCO, Bat SN5, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, FranceID Gene Ecodiagnost, Campus Biotech Innovat Pk, CH-1202 Geneva, SwitzerlandUniv Estado Rio de Janeiro, Lab Micropaleontol, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilUniv Aveiro, Dept Geociencias, GeoBioTec, Aveiro, PortugalSGS Italia SpA, I-35010 Villafranca Padovana, ItalyEcol Studio SpA, I-35127 Padua, ItalySGS Grp Management Ltd, CH-1211 Geneva 1, SwitzerlandPolish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, PL-81712 Sopot, Poland",ID Gene EcodiagnostSGS Italia SpAEcol Studio SpASGS Grp Management Ltd,,,2020-11-24,WOS:000580630100057,32835923,

The present study modelled the growth and feed-backs of blue mussels in natural beds and on turbine foundations in an off-shore wind farm (OWF) located in a shallow coastal ecosystem by coupling a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model to a small-scale 3D hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. The model results showed that blue mussels located higher up in the water column on turbine pillars achieved a 7-18 times higher biomass than those located on the scour protection because the former experience an enhanced advective food supply, Secondly, the high biomasses of blue mussels on foundations created local 'hot spots' of biological activity and changed ecosystem dynamics due to their feed-backs e.g. ingestion of microplankton and copepods, excretion of ammonium and egestion of faecal pellets. The model results were supported by field measurements around foundations of Chl a concentrations and biomasses of the fauna community. Our study emphasised that OWFs seem to be particularly favourable for blue mussels in the western Baltic Sea and that the functioning of the OWFs as artificial reef ecosystems depends upon how the blue mussels interact with their local pelagic and benthic environment.

However state-of-the-art aerodynamic models used for FOWTs usually assume a steady and inviscid flow around the rotor. The induction factor is then computed using Froude-Rankine Actuator Disk theory, also called momentum theory. For a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT), the Blade Element Momentum theory (BEM) may miss important unsteady phenomena when the rotor strongly interacts with its wake [1]. For a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT), an equivalent momentum method is the Double Multiple Streamtube (DMS) theory [2]. Despite its higher CPU cost, the Free Vortex Wake (FVW) theory is an alternative to momentum theories as it takes into account the vorticity shed in the wake by the blades to compute the induction. The aerodynamics is thus entirely unsteady. This study presents a comparison between the DMS and the FVW theory for a twostraight-bladed Floating VAWT mounted on the OC3Hywind SPAR platform [3] for several of the OC3 project load cases [4]. The study shows that the DMS solver is not able to predict important unsteady aerodynamics phenomena when the rotor/wake interaction is strong. The motions of the turbine's platform are significantly impacted and the dynamic loads acting on the rotor blades are very different.

In the present study, the AChE inhibiting potential of organic extracts of production water (produced water) from oil and gas production platforms in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea was determined in an in vitro bioassay based on commercially available purified AChE from the electric organ of Electrophorus electricus (L.). The results from the studies show that produced water contains a combination of AChE inhibiting compounds and compounds stimulating AChE enzymatic activity. The AChE inhibition was predominantly caused by unidentified aromatic compounds in the oil/particulate fraction of produced water, whereas polar compounds in both the water soluble and oil/particulate fraction of produced water caused an apparent stimulation of AChE activity. Substrate saturation studies with fixed concentrations of produced water extracts confirmed that the inhibition occurred in a non-destructive and competitive manner. The concentrations of AChE inhibitors (7.9-453 ng paraoxon-equivalents L-1, 2.2-178 mu g dichlorvos-equivalents L-1) were in many cases found to be several orders of magnitude higher than background levels.

Specimens of three species (Pacific sanddab, Citharichthys sordidus; kelp rockfish, Sebastes atrovirens; and kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus) residing at platforms and representing the regional background within the Santa Barbara Channel and within the San Pedro Basin were collected. Some of the most important contaminant classes related to oil operations are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) because of their potential toxicity and carcinogenicity. However, acute exposure cannot be related directly to PAH tissue concentrations because of rapid metabolism of the parent chemicals in fish; therefore, PAH metabolites in bile were measured, targeting free hydroxylated PAHs (OH-PAHs) liberated by enzymatic hydrolysis of the bound PAH glucuronides and sulfates. An ion-pairing method was developed for confirmatory analysis that targeted PAH glucuronides and sulfates. Concentrations of hydroxylated PAHs in all samples (76 fish from platforms and 64 fish from natural sites) were low, ranging from less than the limits of detection (5 to 120 nanograms per milliliter bile; 0.03 to 42 nanograms per milligram protein) to a maximum of 320 nanograms per milliliter bile (32 nanograms per milligram protein). A previously proposed dosimeter of PAH exposure in fish, 1-hydroxypyrene, was not detected at any platform site. Low concentrations of 1-hydroxypyrene were detected in 3 of 12 kelp rockfish collected from a natural reef site off Santa Barbara. The most prevalent OH-PAH, 2-hydroxyfluorene, was detected at low concentrations in seven fish of various species; of these, four were from two of the seven platform sites. The greatest concentrations of 2-hydroxyfluorene were found in three fish of various species from Platform Holly and were only about threefold above low, yet quantifiable, concentrations found in three fish from Horseshoe Reef, East Anacapa Island, and Coche Point natural sites; the mean concentrations among all sampling sites were not measurably different.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0196-1497,,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA, 22092, USA",,,,2012-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15302010960,,

More than 100,000 birds regularly use this region as passage migrants. As an impact of wind farms these resting places will be disturbed. But to a limited scale resting birds are able to swerve and find other places, if the area affected is not a highly frequented resting place. The migrating birds use the coastal zone more intensively than offshore areas. Simultaneous mass migration of birds takes place only a few days each year. The birds use different flying heights - lower in the offshore-area than near the coast. Barrier-effects and collisions caused by offshore windfarms must be expected. It is still not possible to predict the number of bird collisions likely to occur at all wind farms proposed. An early warning system, compatible illumination and a concept to switch off the wind mills in times of massive migration could help to avoid bird collision.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0940-6808,,,,,,,,,,,"Planungsgemeinschaft Marienau, Neetzetalstr 13, D-21368 Dahlem, Germany",,,,2011-12-09,BCI:BCI201200008096,,

Foundations were brought to failure with varying loading rates, resulting in drained, partly drained, or undrained behavior. Increases in bearing capacity were observed as the loading rate increased. This behavior was caused by a combination of dilative soil behavior and suction created by upward movement, known as the boot effect. For mono bucket foundations, the boot effect resulted in an increased bearing capacity that was 18 to 25 times higher than the drained capacity.

In this contribution, a coupled finite element/wavenumber integration model for noise prediction is presented and validated by measurements. The ocean environment, especially the sea bottom, can only be characterized with limited accuracy in terms of input parameters for the numerical model at hand. Therefore the effect of these parameter uncertainties on the prediction of sound pressure levels (SPLs) in the water column is investigated by a probabilistic approach. In fact, a variation of the bottom material parameters by means of Monte-Carlo simulations shows significant effects on the predicted SPLs. A sensitivity analysis of the model with respect to the single quantities is performed, as well as a global variation. Based on the latter, the probability distribution of the SPLs at an exemplary receiver position is evaluated and compared to measurements. The aim of this procedure is to develop a model to reliably predict an interval for the SPLs, by quantifying the degree of uncertainty of the SPLs with the MC simulations.

We integrated and analyzed seismic data collected in 2008, and logging-while-drilling (LWD) data and coring results acquired by the Fugro Voyager in 2015 in the Shenhu area on the northern slope of the South China Sea. Based on seismic and well-log correlation, a BSR with typical characteristics of gas hydrates and free gas was identified at 237 m, below the mudline (BML). However, LWD data reveal a 63 m thick hydrate layer from 205 to 268 m BML. Increases in resistivity and velocity at 262 m BML indicate that gas hydrate is likely presented below the BSR. The observed pore-water freshening with depth and infrared image of core samples are consistent with geophysical interpretation. Seismic and well interpretations reveal continuous, discontinuous, and pluming BSRs in the Shenhu area. The continuous BSR indicates the base of the methane gas hydrate stability zone, and structure II gas hydrate is likely presented below the BSR. Deep thermogenic fluid locally entrapped within shallow-buried sediments may reinforce gas-hydrate accumulations near the discontinuous and pluming BSRs.

Here we report the results of three postdevelopment experiments testing the effects of a small wind park on the abundance, distribution, and behavior of wintering Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima), a large sea duck. Our approach was based on the rationale that the probability of detecting an impact should increase with decreasing distances from the wind park. Because prey abundance is likely to drive the distribution of wintering ciders, we removed that confounding variable by (1) randomizing its effect over the study area, and (2) incorporating the variable into the analysis. In the first experiment, we compared the abundance and distribution of eiders when wind turbines were switched on and off. This was complemented by investigating the escape behavior of flocks when wind turbines were switched on after they had been off for one full day. In a second experiment, we tested for any departure from the habitat-matching rule, which states that the proportion of eiders and the proportion of food should be equal at different distances from the park. In a third experiment, the flying behavior of eiders in relation to the wind park was analyzed by measuring the landing and flying rates for patches of decoys located at 100, 300, and 500 m from the wind park. We found little evidence for negative impacts, because we could not detect any effect in three tests out of four. Only in the decoy experiment did we observe eiders reducing their landing and flying near (100 m from) the wind park. We conclude, for the conditions under which our experiments were performed, that the wind park did not substantially affect wintering Common Eiders. However, many aspects of the potential impacts of offshore wind parks on sea ducks have not been covered by our study and, therefore, cannot be generalized to other species or other phases of the annual cycle. Nevertheless, we argue that the use of multiple postdevelopment experiments based on a gradient approach is a helpful complement to BACI studies.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,18,0,30,,,1051-0761,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Environm Res Inst, Div Coastal Zone Ecol, DK-8410 Ronde, Denmark",,,,2002-06-01,WOS:000175693800026,,

They vary in depth from a few meters to over 400 m and range geographically throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico.Despite the number and ubiquitous placement of these structures, little information existed on associated fisheries resources due to difficulties in sampling petroleum platforms with traditional fisheries methods. Hydroacoustics enabled researchers to accurately assess the fisheries resources associated with these structures. From 1994 to 1996 dual-beam hydroacoustics were employed on quarterly research trips to measure the density and in situ target strengths of fishes associated with petroleum platforms in 20, 60 and 219 m of water. Species identification was provided by visual point counts using a remotely operated underwater vehicle. Density varied significantly with platform, distance from the platform, depth, platform side and time of the year. Platforms on the continental shell had a near field area of influence of approximately 18 m, while near field area of influence for the site on the continental slope was 10 m but the relationship was not as well defined as other sites. Average estimated abundance and 95% confidence intervals over the study period were 26 347 (+/-3636) at the 60 m site, 13 444 (+/-4578) at the 20 m site and 11 224 (+/-2618) at the 219 m site. Fishes were distributed throughout the water column at the sites on the continental shelf while at the 219 m site over 88% of the fishes were found in the upper 60 m.Visual point count surveys detected 10 species, 18 species and 14 species at the 20, 60 and 219 Lu sites, respectively. Despite the large number of fishes found at each site, 6-7 species constituted over 95% of all the fishes observed at each site and species composition was dominated by a single species at each site. The dominant species changed with site, and the most common species observed at each site included: Atlantic spadefish (Chaetodipterus faber) at the 20 m site, blue runner (Caranx crysos) at the 60 m site, and creole fish (Paranthias furcifer) at the 219 m site.

On the other hand, the deformation characteristics of soil defined as the soil strain at 50% of maximum deviatoric stress (epsilon(50)) have a considerable effect on the generated p-y curve. In this research, several models are proposed to predict epsilon(50) specifically for designing the very long pile foundations of offshore oil and gas platforms in the South Pars field, Persian Gulf, Iran. Herein, epsilon(50) is evaluated using extensive soil data, including in-situ and laboratory test results using evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR). The effects of the undrained shear strength, the normalized tip resistance of the cone penetration test, the over-burden pressure, the plasticity index and the over-consolidation ratio on epsilon(50) are investigated in marine clays. It is demonstrated that the normalized cone tip resistance, which is an indication of the soil's undrained shear strength, leads to more realistic epsilon(50) values compared with the laboratory-derived undrained shear strength parameter. In addition, the application of the soil-index properties and the over-burden pressure in the models, improves their estimation quality.

Dynamic responses of the TLP were monitored at different locations using load cells, a camera-based motion recognition system and a laser Doppler vibrometer. The analysis of variability of the TLP responses and statistical quantification of their linearity or nonlinearity, as non-destructive means of structural monitoring from the output-only condition, remains a challenging problem. In this study, the delay vector variance (DVV) method is used to statistically study the degree of nonlinearity of measured response signals from a TLP. DVV is observed to create a marker estimating the degree to which a change in signal nonlinearity reflects real-time behaviour of the structure and also to establish the sensitivity of the instruments employed to these changes.

The most critical technique of the foundation is the self-floating towing technique based on a reasonable subdivision inside the bucket. To predict the dynamic behaviors of the LPCBF in waves supported by the air cushion, the hydrodynamic software MOSES is used to simulate the three-dimensional motion of the foundation in the towing construction site. The prototype foundation models are established using MOSES with a water draft of 4 m, 5 m, and 6 m in given environmental conditions. The results show that the hydrodynamic responses of the large floater with air cushions depend not only on the wave conditions but also on the mass of the water column, air cushion height, and air pressure distribution. In addition, the hydrodynamic characteristics can be tuned resulting in small dynamic responses in a particular sea state by changing the draft and water plug height. The floating technique of the LPCBF with supported air cushions in waves is highly competitive for saving cost while using few expensive types of equipment during the towing transportation.

Planned or routine events that result in disturbance to populations and communities provide an opportunity for scientists to apply, well-replicated and statistically powerful sampling designs to assess subsequent biological effects. For example, a thick layer of sessile invertebrates is the prominent biotic feature of intertidal and shallow subtidal portions of offshore petroleum platforms in southern California. Given the central role of such invertebrates in providing food and shelter, their presence can reasonably be expected to influence associated fish community structure. At one platform on the San Pedro Shelf, invertebrate biomass was completely removed from support pilings and horizontal crossmembers to a depth of 20 m with high-pressure water during a standard hydrocleaning event in November 2007. Three nearby platforms remained undisturbed, providing a unique opportunity to test for disturbance-related changes in the local fish assemblage and the overall time course of community recovery. The potential impact of the abrupt and intense removal of the invertebrate layer was assessed with survey data collected periodically for one year prior- and one year post-hydrocleaning in a modified Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design. Asymmetrical multivariate analyses of variance revealed a significant effect of disturbance to fish, driven largely by reductions in the abundance of numerically dominant blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis). Nevertheless, the system was surprisingly resilient, recovering to pre-disturbance conditions within ten months. Our results demonstrate that a well-replicated BACI sampling design can detect even subtle biological changes in response to disturbance, a key step towards developing a mechanistic understanding of community disassembly in the face of increasingly frequent and intense perturbations.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,12,0,15,,,0038-3872,2162-4534,,,,,,,,,,"Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",,,,2013-02-22,BCI:BCI201300188587,,

Although easily recognizable, the species has not been previously reported from anywhere else in the Atlantic. In the latter instance, the species was collected during monitoring of the invasive scleractinian corals Tubastraea spp. on an oil platform originally from Singapore and now located at Todos os Santos Bay, northeastern Brazil. Colonies of T. arcuatum were also found associated with three species of sponges, giving evidence that it is also growing in the natural environment. Todos os Santos Bay is characterized by intense commercial shipping traffic and oil exploration and the finding of T. arcuatum on an oil platform provides strong evidence that it represents a non-indigenous species in the Atlantic. Owing to the possible impact of T. arcuatum in Brazil, further studies and monitoring of its bioinvasion are recommended.

This uncertainty, combined with a lengthy and complex Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) phase prior to consent, has slowed the growth of the marine renewables sector. Information on completed and ongoing EIAs at MREI sites across Europe was summarised and compared amongst sites and with completed, comprehensive EIAs for Horns Rev offshore wind farm and the SeaGen tidal turbine site at Strangford Lough. This allowed for the identification of commonalities and differences in monitoring activities, and of data gaps in the wave energy EIA process. Studies on the socio-economic impacts of MREIs were lacking, as were monitoring of fish, fish habitats, electromagnetic fields and their impacts on marine wildlife. Even amongst sites monitoring similar topics, methodologies varied greatly. Science cannot inform the management of marine renewables whilst there are inconsistencies in baseline and impact monitoring, as this study has documented. A streamlined EIA process and collaborations between researchers and developers are required to move the industry forward. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The genetic structure of these populations has been unknown. A question has arisen regarding whether there have been multiple invasions of this species. Five platforms were surveyed; only two were found to possess populations large enough to sample - GI-93C and MC-280A. Tissue samples were collected and analyzed via Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs). STRUCTURE analysis identified four genetically distinct clusters or groups among the two platforms. The MC-280A population exhibited an overwhelming association with only one genetic group. Although the three other groups were represented, they were present in small proportions - 1-5%. By contrast, the GI-93C population showed high genetic diversity, with colonies exhibiting association with all four groups in widely varying proportions. The lack of genetic variability on MC-280A most likely resulted from a single recruitment event on this more isolated platform. It is possible that this event could have been derived from a second invasion of this species. In that case, treatment of the invasive would best be focused on the species at the vector point (e.g., treating the hull or ballast water of a ship prior to reaching its destination) rather than in the already infected environment, to avoid repeated replacement invasions. On GI-93-C, the genetic variability was most likely the result of multiple recruitment events. Other possible factors causing the observed pattern could include recruitment from genetically diverse populations in the region and sampling from an older age population where reproduction could result in admixture.

This study used baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) to compare species richness, fish abundance and size along 42.3 km of subsea pipeline and in adjacent areas of varying habitats. The pipeline is laid in an onshore-offshore direction enabling surveys to encompass a range of depths from 9 m nearshore out to 140 m depth offshore. Surveys off the pipeline were performed across this depth range and in an array of natural habitats (sand, macroalgae, coral reef) between 1 km and 40 km distance from the pipeline. A total of 14,953 fish were observed comprising 240 species (131 on the pipeline and 225 off-pipeline) and 59 families (39 on the pipeline and 56 off-pipeline) and the length of 8,610 fish were measured. The fish assemblage on and off the pipeline was similar in depths of <80 m. In depths beyond 80 m, the predominant habitat off-pipeline was sand and differences between fish assemblages on and off-pipeline were more pronounced. The pipeline was characterised by higher biomass and abundances of larger-bodied, commercially important species such as: Pristipomoides multidens (goldband snapper), Lutjanus malabaricus (saddletail snapper) and Lutjanus russellii (Moses' snapper) among others, and possessed a catch value 2-3 times higher per stereo-BRUV deployment than that of fish observed off-pipeline. Adjacent natural seabed habitats possessed higher abundances of Atule mate (yellowtail scad), Nemipterus spp. (threadfin bream) and Terapon jarbua (crescent grunter), species of no or low commercial value. This is the first published study to use stereo-BRUVs to report on the importance of subsea infrastructure to commercially important fishes over a depth gradient and increases our knowledge of the fish assemblage associated with subsea infrastructure off north-west Australia. These results provide a greater understanding of ecological and fisheries implications of decommissioning subsea infrastructure on the north-west shelf, and will help better inform decision-making on the fate of infrastructure at different depths.",,,,,,,,,28,1,0,0,22,0,29,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, AustraliaBHP, Perth, WA, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Crawley, WA, Australia",BHP,,,2018-11-26,WOS:000451325700055,30475853,

At the same time, offshore wind industry has taken the great leap towards the ocean. Such wind farms hold more and more wind turbines (>100), depths increase leaving shallow waters (almost 100 m deep), and the power installed is increasing at a dramatic rate not thought to be possible only one decade ago (currently reaching 400 MW). These facts are ones of the great advances of the XXI century, but so far, it has not been done a deep reflection on the impact of the offshore wind on the aforementioned SDG, and on how the offshore wind is going to accomplish all the challenges happening when trying to reach such SDG. The achievement of some of the SDG and the offshore wind technology progress go, with no doubt, hand in hand. This is the case of Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production), Goal 13 (Climate action), or Goal 14 (Life below water).

This is the case of Goal 7 (Affordable and clean energy), Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth), or Goal 10 (Reducing inequalities). In this paper, the great contribution of the offshore wind technology to achieve the SDG is commented, making special emphasis on the possible weaknesses that could appear, and on how to solve them.

This makes wind retrievals from satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) an attractive option in connection with planning of offshore wind farms. Because the wind power density is proportional to the wind speed cubed, it is important to achieve the highest possible absolute accuracy on SAR wind speed retrievals for wind energy applications. A method is presented for inter-calibration of SAR observations from Envisat and Sentinel-1A/B. Sensor-specific effects on the SAR-retrieved wind speeds are first quantified through comparisons against collocated ocean buoy observations. Based on global circulation model simulations of wind speed and direction, we retrieve the Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS) for different radar incidence angles. Residuals between the retrieved and the observed NRCS are used to inter-calibrate the observed NRCS before reprocessing to SAR wind fields. The inter-calibration leads to an improved agreement between SAR and buoy wind speeds with biases below 0.2 m s(-1) for all investigated SAR sensors. Estimates of the wind resource improve with respect to the buoy observations for ten of the twelve sites investigated. The average deviation between wind power densities is reduced from 20% to 8% as the SAR inter calibration leads to more conservative estimates of the wind resource.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,0,13,,,0034-4257,1879-0704,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",,,,2019-10-22,WOS:000486355300044,,

Now, it is expanded to the problem of marine wind farms taking into account the singularities of the marine environment. In fact, if the maintenance problems in wind farms are so diverse like the reading of on-condition data, their synchronization and, after, their transmission, in marine wind farms the problems are bigger, including the distance from GSM antenna to transmit and read data remotely. Additionally, and not less important, there is the distance between the marine wind farms and the staff responsible by its maintenance. In this case, the resources and time involved to develop maintenance interventions are much more expensive when compared to similar actions in land.

The project was aimed at developing improved design methods for laterally loaded piles, as used in offshore wind turbine foundations. The importance of the consistent and integrated interpretation of the soil data from laboratory and field investigations is particularly emphasised. The chosen constitutive model for sand is an enhanced version of the state parameter-based bounding surface plasticity model, which, crucially, is able to reproduce the dependency of sand behaviour on void ratio and stress level. The predictions from three-dimensional finite-element analyses, performed before the field tests, show good agreement with the measured behaviour, proving the adequacy of the developed numerical model and the calibration process for the constitutive model. This numerical model directly facilitated the development of new soil reaction curves for use in Winkler-type design models for laterally loaded piles in natural marine sands.",,,,,,,,,49,1,0,0,0,0,51,,,0016-8505,1751-7656,,,,,,,,,,"Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, EnglandUniv Oxford, Dept Engn Sci, Oxford, EnglandDelft Univ Technol, Delft, NetherlandsUniv Coll Dublin, Sch Civil Engn, Dublin, Ireland",,,,2020-11-05,WOS:000582085300007,,

Between February 2004 and January 2007, seven dead white-tailed sea eagles were found near wind turbines in Hokkaido prefecture, Japan. We used this population as the target species in the management model. In the management model, we assumed that the bodies of any birds killed in collisions would disappear within 5 days, while the searches for carcasses were conducted every 30 days. The calculation period of the management model was 22 years, consisting of a 5-year planning period and a 17-year operation period. The operation management schedule was reviewed every three years. The utilized capacity was estimated from the data for 2003 to 2005 for Hokkaido. The operation rate multiplied by the utilized capacity gives the corrected utilized capacity. After the break-even point of the utilized capacity was determined, the time that fell below this was defined as the failure rate of the business. The results showed that the end point was achieved 99% of the time, while the failure rate was below 10%. An optimistic scenario was not affected by the two management scenarios or conditions used as protection measures. Conversely, a pessimistic scenario was achieved only under specific conditions in the management scenario. The main goals were to 1) estimate the number of days required for a carcass to disappear, 2) develop a search technique to improve the discovery rate of carcasses, 3) conduct regular surveys of carcasses, 4) determine the growth rate and population size by monitoring, 5) determine the results of breeding by breeding pairs in Hokkaido, and 6) examine risk hedging to deal with failure of the business.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1342-4327,,,,,,,,,,,"Japan Weather Association Tokyo office, 3-1-1 Higashiikebukuro, Toyoshima, Tokyo 170-6055, Japan",,,,2007-11-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14404024396,,

The marine environment will play a key role in hosting or supporting these new energy strategies. However, it is unclear how the construction, operation and eventual decommissioning of these energy systems, and their related infrastructure, will impact the marine environment, the ecosystem services (i.e. cultural, regulating, provisioning and supporting) and in turn the benefits it provides for human well-being. This uncertainty stems from a lack of research that has synthesised into a common currency the various effects of each energy sector on marine ecosystems and the benefits humans derive from it. To address this gap, the present study reviews existing ecosystem impact studies for offshore components of nuclear, offshore wind, offshore gas and offshore oil sectors and translates them into the common language of ecosystem service impacts that can be used to evaluate current policies. The results suggest that differences exist in the way in which energy systems impact ecosystem services, with the nuclear sector having a predominantly negative impact on cultural ecosystem services; oil and gas a predominately negative impact on cultural, provisioning, regulating and supporting ecosystem services; while wind has a mix of impacts on cultural, provisioning and supporting services and an absence of studies for regulating services. This study suggests that information is still missing with regard to the full impact of these energy sectors on specific types of benefits that humans derive from the marine environment and proposes possible areas of targeted research.

True pre-impact data, however, are rarely available because the onset of ocean biomonitoring in the 20th century frequently postdates the timing of such shifts. Death assemblages (DAs) sampled on a sea-floor capture previous community states and represent archives of past preimpact conditions. This is because they change more slowly (10-10,000 years) than the corresponding living assemblage (LA) (yearly scales of turnover). Strong and rapid directional changes such as those due to human activities are therefore not immediately captured by DAs, leading to a greater live-dead (LD) mismatch than under natural processes alone. We used this approach to infer disturbance of benthic habitats around platforms in two major oilfields in the Persian (Arabian) Gulf: Umm Al Dalkh (UA) and Zakum (ZK). We found that, first, LD metrics showed no correlation with contamination levels or distance from the platform. Second, although LAs and DAs significantly differed in species composition and did not overlap in multivariate space, the difference was generated by a single species, the semelid deposit-feeding bivalve Ervilia purpurea. This bivalve was not found alive, but constituted 30-50% of the DAs at the field scale and up to 92% at some stations. Radiocarbon-calibrated amino acid racemization dating of valves of this species showed considerable spatial and temporal heterogeneity in production over the last decades and centuries, implying a boom-and-bust population dynamics; its absence in LAs is thus likely unrelated to the onset of oil platform production in the 20th century. The remaining LD differences probably reflect within- and multiple-habitat temporal or spatial averaging, and taxonomic similarity and rank-order agreement in species abundance at the field scale are comparable with values recorded in pristine areas. Therefore, we found no evidence of major community shifts in this oilfield area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The microbial communities and their potential for metal corrosion were characterized for three oil production platforms that varied in their oil-water separation processes, fluid recycling practices, and history of microbially influenced corrosion (MIC). Microbial diversity was evaluated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and numbers of total bacteria, archaea, and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were estimated by qPCR. The rates of S-35 sulfate reduction assay (SRA) were measured as a proxy for metal biocorrosion potential. A variety of microorganisms common to oil production facilities were found, but distinct communities were associated with the design of the platform and varied with different locations in the processing stream. Stagnant, lower temperature (< 37 A degrees C) sites in all platforms had more SRB and higher SRA compared to samples from sites with higher temperatures and flow rates. However, high (5 mmol L-1) levels of hydrogen sulfide and high numbers (10(7) mL(-1)) of SRB were found in only one platform. This platform alone contained large separation tanks with long retention times and recycled fluids from stagnant sites to the beginning of the oil separation train, thus promoting distribution of biocorrosive microorganisms.

Here, the student will combine advanced demographic analysis and state-of-the-art wildlife tracking to provide critical insight into how mortality through collisions with offshore turbines could affect long-term population viability of a high-profile marine predator of high conservation status in the UK, developing a much-needed framework to assist with consenting decisions for marine renewable energy developments.A large increase in offshore wind turbine capacity is anticipated in the next decade, raising concerns about possible adverse impacts on birds as a result of mortality caused by collisions with turbine blades. Gannets have been identified as a species of particular concern but there is great uncertainty over the likely consequences of additional mortality for gannet population sizes. The student will use a unique combination of demographic modelling, field tracking data and digital aerial survey data to address four aims:1. Modelling gannet population dynamics. Using several decades of demographic data for gannet colonies around the UK and NW Europe, the student will: (A) Develop stage-structured matrix models incorporating density-dependent survival, breeding success and natal vs non-natal recruitment for individual gannet colonies and for the UK population as a whole; (B) Test model goodness of fit by retrospectively projecting population growth over the past three decades, for which very reliable population size data are available, and; (C) Refine models using a Bayesian framework to test effects of spatial and temporal variation in vital rates on population dynamics.2. Assessing potential effects of wind farms on stage-specific mortality. The student will: (A) Use extensive existing data on foraging tracks of adults at different colonies around the UK and NW Europe, combined with novel data on tracks of immature birds obtained using GPS-GSM loggers, to quantify and compare densities of adults and immatures at sea; (B) analyse digital aerial survey data from existing windfarms to determine turbine avoidance rates by adults and immature birds, and; (c) use these data to quantify the extent to which mortality imposed on adults and younger birds could plausibly differ.3. Predicting impacts of heightened mortality on population dynamics and viability. Using a life-table response experiment (LTRE) framework, the student will examine the extent to which plausible increases in stage-specific mortalities would change population projections for individual gannet colonies over a period of 30 years (the likely operating periods of offshore wind farms). S/he will then use a meta-population framework to examine how the imposition of source-sink dynamics through heightened mortality at large colonies (which are very attractive to prospecting pre-breeders) would simultaneously affect projected population changes at colonies across NW Europe.4. Informing advice on policy. Working closely with project partners, s/he will consider the implications of the results from 1-3 in terms of: (i) advising on how different levels of imposed stage-specific mortality would affect gannet population dynamics and colony sizes, and; (ii) developing broadly applicable tools that could be parameterized for other species and in other contexts to reduce the uncertainty associated with planning consent decisions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1947275,,,,,,,,University of Leeds,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15304641,,

About 85% of existing offshore wind turbines are supported using monopile foundations, which are made of large welded plates. The locked in residual stresses in a monopile structure have a great impact on its fatigue life. The new emerged technology of additive manufacturing (AM), which is widely used in other industries such as aerospace and automotive, has the potential to significantly improve a lifespan of the structure by managing the residual stress fields and microstructure in the future monopiles, and moreover reduce the manufacturing cost. In order to achieve this goal, new materials that are used for additive manufacturing parts fabrication and their behaviour in the harsh marine environment and under operational loading conditions need to be understood. Also purely welding fabrication technique employed during AM process is likely to significantly affect crack growth behaviour in air as well as in seawater. This paper presents a review of additive manufacturing technology and suitable techniques for offshore structures. Existing literature that reports current data on fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth tests conducted on AM parts is summarised and analysed, highlighting different steel grades and applications, with the view to illustrating the requirements for the new optimised functionally graded structures in offshore wind structures by means of AM technique.

They are considered as renewable and environmentally friendly technologies to use the sea and its resources (e.g. offshore wind farms, bioenergy production or ocean fertilization). While most green technologies are currently at an embryonic stage, it remains to see whether such technologies will be commercialized successfully. Given this situation, this research broaches two legal issues for the green technology development.First, this research addresses the legal nature of the experimental activities of green technologies on the ocean. Principally, it is reasonable to consider those activities as marine scientific research which is governed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea because the Convention does not pose any specific limitations to the marine scientific research. However, the purpose, means and scope of the marine scientific research involving the green technology are regulated by the decisions provided under the Conferences of the Parties to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matters, to its 2006 Protocol and to the Convention on Biological Diversity. These decisions from the Conferences do not modify legally the definition of marine scientific research. However, they can serve as guidelines that states are encouraged to consider in the application of green technology on the ocean.Secondly, the contemporary science suffers from lack of knowledge which assesses the possible impact of green technology on the marine environment. Therefore, the precautionary principle may be convincingly applicable to dealing with such scientific uncertainty. However, this principle could be controversial because conventions interpret it in different ways. To be specific, this principle in some conventions may work to justify the development of green technologies, whereas it in others seems to curb vigorous research activities on the ocean. This apparent discrepancy can be resolved if one interprets the precautionary principle as establishing procedural criteria, rather than as creating specific obligations of conduct. Furthermore, the Article 31(3)(c) of Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and the principle of harmonization could be another solution to avoid conflicting interpretation found in different conventions.",,,,"해양 녹색기술(green technology)개발은 재생가능하고 환경친화적 방식의 과학기술을 해양에서 적용하려는 시도이다. 국가와 민간 사업체들은 해상 풍력발전, 해양 바이오에너지 생산 및 해양시비에 큰 관심을 갖고 있다. 현재 대다수의 해양 녹색기술은 아직 상용화에 앞서 실험, 연구하는 개발 초기단계로서, 이러한 상황에서 제기될 수 있는 주요 국제법적 쟁점은 두 가지이다.첫 번째 쟁점은 해양 녹색기술 실험행위를 어떠한 해양활동으로 이해할 것인가이다. 유엔해양법협약은 해양과학조사에 대하여 구체적인 제한을 부과하지 않고 있기 때문에, 녹색기술 실험은 큰 문제없이 해양과학조사로 볼 수 있다. 반면, 최근 런던덤핑협약체제와 생물다양성협약 당사국회의의 결정은 해양 녹색기술을 수반한 과학조사의 규모, 장소 및 목적을 제한하고자 한다. 이와 같은 당사국회의의 결정은 기존의 해양과학조사 개념을 변화시키지 않지만, 과학조사 수행시 국가들이 고려할 수 있는 행동지침의 역할을 하게 된다.둘째, 해양 녹색기술이 해양환경에 미치는 영향은 과학적으로 충분히 입증되지 않았다. 이와 같이 과학적 불확실성이 존재하는 경우, 사전주의원칙이 적용될 수 있다. 문제는 여러 조약상의 사전주의원칙이 서로 다르게 해석될 수 있다는 점이다. 따라서 사전주의원칙은 해양 녹색기술개발을 정당화하는 동시에, 개발을 막는 근거가 될 수 있다. 하지만 사전주의원칙을 사전주의적 조치를 요구하는 행위규칙이 아닌 절차적 기준으로 해석한다면, 협약간 모순된 법적 의무가 창출된다는 우려를 해소할 수 있다. 또한 다수 조약상의 사전주의원칙을 해석할 때, 조약법에 관한 비엔나협약 제31조 3항(c)과 조약간 조화로운 해석원칙에 따른다면, 해석상의 충돌 문제를 방지할 수 있을 것이다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1598-1584,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012-01-01,KJD:ART001704520,,

Our surveys of these platforms in 2006 and 2007 indicate that there is a core group of warm- temperate nearshore reef species in the midwater depth (<30 m), including California sheephead Semicossyphus pulcher, blacksmith Chromis punctipinnis, garibaldi Hypsypops rubicundus, opaleye Girella nigricans, and kelp bass Paralabrax clathratus. Platforms located further from shore (i.e., offshore platforms [>14 km]) had a strong seasonal presence of pelagic fishes (primarily jack mackerel Trachurus symmetricus) and recruit blacksmiths. At platforms closer to shore (i.e., inshore platforms [<4.8 km]), sea basses (Serranidae) and surfperches (Embiotocidae) were predominant; only slight seasonal variations were observed, which were attributed to prespawning aggregations of barred sand bass Paralabrax nebulifer. At the offshore platforms total fish density had a negative relationship with depth but a positive relationship with water temperature; conversely, total fish biomass exhibited a positive relationship with depth but a negative relationship with temperature. In contrast, at the inshore platforms both total fish density and biomass increased with increasing water temperature. With the exception of blacksmiths, nearshore reef fishes showed significantly greater densities of adults than juveniles. Furthermore, some species were observed spawning at these structures. Therefore, the San Pedro Shelf platforms may provide suitable habitat for several species of nearshore reef fish. Removing the upper levels and superstructure of the offshore platforms to a depth of 25 m (the partial removal decommissioning option) would eliminate critical habitat for several fish species and result in a potential loss of 95% of the total fish density and 77% of the total fish biomass, thus reducing the productivity advantages of some of these structures.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,25,0,32,,,1942-5120,,,,,,,,,,,"Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000208152900013,,

However, it has been often proved to be inadequate, while its indiscriminate use is not justified. Thus, in order to minimize estimation errors in offshore wind energy, it is necessary to select the most appropriate distribution for the wind climate description of a specific area. In this context, the performance of several probability distributions for offshore wind speed modeling, using long-term time series from 11 buoys in Eastern Mediterranean Sea (Greek waters) and 8 buoys in Western Mediterranean Sea (Spanish coastal waters) will be assessed for the first time here. We focus on the efficiency of three bounded multi-parameter distributions: Wakeby and Kappa, that have performed very well in completely different areas of the US coasts, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and Johnson S-B distribution, which is introduced here for the first time. It is shown that Johnson S-B, Kappa and Wakeby distributions accurately describe the empirical distribution of offshore wind speed; they have better adaptability than the 3-parameter Weibull distribution and qualify as reliable and prominent candidates for the assessment of offshore wind speed in any sea area. Moreover, Johnson S-B is the only distribution that suits very well for all examined cases, providing consistently fair fits with respect to all goodness-of-fit tests applied. Alternative criteria, such as the performance of the examined probability models in terms of wind power density and average wind turbine power, have also been used for evaluating the fitted wind speed distributions.

Marine wind farms have attracted substantial public interest. The construction of wind facilities offshore may become Europe's most extensive technical development in marine habitats. Due to political pressure to complete construction soon, assessments of possible wind farm locations, for example in the German sectors of the North Sea and Baltic Sea, have to be based on existing knowledge.2. In this study, we developed a wind farm sensitivity index (WSI) for seabirds. We applied this index to the Exclusive Economic Zone and the national waters of Germany in the North Sea. We chose nine factors, derived from species' attributes, to be included in the WSI: flight manoeuvrability; flight altitude; percentage of time flying; nocturnal flight activity; sensitivity towards disturbance by ship and helicopter traffic; flexibility in habitat use; biogeographical population size; adult survival rate; and European threat and conservation status. Each factor was scored on a 5-point scale from 1 (low vulnerability of seabirds) to 5 (high vulnerability of seabirds). Five of these factors could be dealt with by real data but four could only be assessed by subjective considerations based on at-sea experience; in the latter cases, suggestions of the first author were independently modulated by experts.3. Species differed greatly in their sensitivity index (SSI). Black-throated diver Gavia arctica and red-throated diver Gavia stellata ranked highest (= most sensitive), followed by velvet scoter Melanitta fusca, sandwich tern Sterna sandvicensis and great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo. The lowest values were recorded for black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, black-headed gull Larus ridibundus and northern fulmar Fulmarus glacialis.4. A WSI score for areas of the North Sea and Baltic Sea was calculated from the species-specific sensitivity index values. Coastal waters in the south-eastern North Sea had values indicating greater vulnerability than waters further offshore throughout the whole year.5. Derived from the frequency distribution of the WSI, we suggest a 'level of concern' and a 'level of major concern' that are visualized spatially and could act as a basis for the selection of marine wind farm locations.6. Synthesis and applications. The wind farm sensitivity index might be useful in strategic environmental impact assessments (EIA). Results of small-scale EIA from wind installations should be considered within a more global perspective, provided, for example, by large mapping projects and detailed behavioural studies. This is difficult in normal EIA, particularly in highly dynamic coastal/marine habitats, and the results of this study fill an important gap by providing information on the potential sensitivity of seabirds and the importance of locations of wind installations.",,,,,,,,,177,0,0,0,142,0,200,,,0021-8901,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Kiel, Res & Technol Ctr FTZ, D-25761 Busum, GermanyInselstn Helgoland, Inst Avian Res Vogelwarte Helgoland, D-27494 Helgoland, Germany",Inselstn Helgoland,,,2004-08-01,WOS:000222721600013,,

Besides gaining relevant information to fisheries management under the Common Fisheries Policy, the data of the DCF will gain importance in assessing the impacts of fishing on the ecosystem of the Baltic Sea.Materials and methods. The catch of the demersal German Baltic Sea trawl fleet between 2006 and 2009 was sampled by on-board observers to investigate the temporal and spatial patterns in catch composition.Results. There was a general increment in tow duration, landing weights, and discard weights from west to east. The most important species by catch weight was cod, for which highest catches were obtained during spring in ICES subdivision 25. Single hauls exceeded 25 h and caught more than 9900 kg of cod. On average, about 5%, 13%, and 20% and of the captured cod, flounder, and dab, respectively, were discarded.Conclusion. The presently reported study provides a benchmark for the German Baltic Fisheries that can be used for assessment of new management regulations and/or new marine policies. A comprehensive documentation of the spatial and temporal catch distribution of the German Baltic demersal trawl fleet, prior to the implementation of marine spatial planning measures such as marine protected areas or offshore wind farms, should help to evaluate the implications of intensifying spatial use on the fishing industry.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,4,0,5,,,0137-1592,,,,,,,,,,,"Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Seefischerei, D-22767 Hamburg, GermanyJohann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Balt Sea Fisheries, D-18069 Rostock, Germany",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000299844300008,,

To avoid delays in consenting processes and to streamline the construction and operation phase, functional mitigation measures are required which efficiently reduces bird mortality. Vision is the primary sensory system in birds, which for a number of species also includes the ultraviolet spectrum. Many bird species that are known to collide with offshore wind turbines are sensitive in the violet or ultraviolet spectrum. For species that are mainly active at lower ambient light levels, lighting may deter birds from the lit area. Utilizing (ultra) violet lights may in addition not disturb humans. However, we do not know whether UV-sensitive birds in flight actually respond behaviourally to UV lights.Methods: We therefore tested the efficacy of two types of lights within the violet (400 nm) and ultraviolet (365 nm) spectrum to deter birds from the lit area. These lights were placed vertically and monitored continuously between dusk and dawn using an avian radar system.Results: Relative to control nights, bird flight activity (abundance) was 27% lower when the ultraviolet light was on. Violet light resulted in a 12% decrease in overall abundance, and in addition, a vertical displacement was seen, increasing the average flight altitude by 7 m. Although temporal changes occurred, this effect persisted over the season below 40 m above sea level.Conclusions: Although the results from this pilot study are promising, we argue there still is a long way to go before a potentially functional design to mitigate collisions that has proven to be effective in situ may be in place.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,0,6,,,2053-7166,,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Terr Ecol Dept, Trondheim, NorwaySteinoysund, Smola, Norway",Steinoysund,,,2018-01-11,WOS:000418951500001,,

Since the underwater noise generated by piling poses a threat to marine mammals, the issue of the detrimental impact of noise on Sousa Chinensis has drawn considerable attention. To avoid behavioral disturbances and injury from pile driving noise, we propose the Underwater Noise Impact Region Alert System (UNIRAS) to estimate the acoustic field at any depth and distance from the piling sources. The system can be illustrated as four components: environment databases, an acoustic propagation model, source modeling and alert region (AR) prediction. Inputs are derived from the Taiwan Coastal Ocean Nowcast/Forecast System (TCONFS), which generates underwater sound speed profiles with temporal and spatial variation, along with geoacoustic and bathymetry databases that are imported as environmental inputs. Adiabatic mode theory is used to simulate the piling noise propagation in shallow water and the impulsive noise emanating from the source is evaluated via the finite element method. With the auditory threshold of cetacean being set as the criterion level, the system can demonstrate the modeling outputs and predict the noise impact region, and these results are useful for planning how to station the guard boats to prevent dolphins from entering the noise impact region.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0218-396X,1793-6489,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Engn Sci & Ocean Engn, Taipei 106, TaiwanInd Technol Res Inst, Hsinchu 31040, Taiwan",,,,2014-05-08,WOS:000333325700008,,

A mathematical model is derived to cater for the steady state behaviour of entire system. A simplified model for the pump is implemented together with different control scheme options for regulating the rotor shaft power. A new control scheme is investigated, based on the combined use of hydraulic pressure and pitch control. Using a steady-state analysis, the study shows how the adoption of alternative control schemes in a the wind turbine-hydraulic pump system may result in higher energy yields than those from a conventional system with an electrical generator and standard pitch control for power regulation.

The presence of significant numbers of large turbines in wind farms will lead to reduced wind speeds and wind stresses in the wakes within and downwind of the farms. This in turn will affect surface fluxes, currents, and mixing in lake waters, generally allowing increased surface temperatures and reduced summer time mixed-layer depths. The potential magnitude of these impacts is investigated with a one dimensional application of the Coupled Hydrodynamical-Ecological Model for Regional and Shelf Seas model for three different water depths using observed meteorological data as input.Plain Language Summary Once a wind farm is installed there will be modifications to the wind field caused by the wakes of the turbines. This has been well studied for wind farms such as Horns Rev in the North Sea. For Lakes Erie and Ontario the areas with water depths suitable for wind farms are limited and we envisage multiple farms relatively close together. Wake effects will then cause significant reductions in the overall wind field of the area and have potentially significant impacts on mixing and air-water gas transfers. The research goal is to study airflow over selected Great Lakes with and without wind farms and to investigate the potential impact of wind farm development on circulation, mixing, and water quality issues.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,0,6,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"York Univ, Ctr Res Earth & Space Sci, Toronto, ON, CanadaYork Univ, Lassonde Sch Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada",,,,2019-05-08,WOS:000464656900021,,

We compare the resulting data reconstruction with that of a model based on a neural network, which has been previously reported as a data-mining algorithm suitable for reconstructing this signal. Our results present evidence that the stochastic approach outperforms the neural network in the high frequency domain (1 Hz). Although neural network retrieves accurate step-forward predictions, with low mean square errors, the stochastic approach predictions better preserve the statistics and the frequency components of the original signal, retaining high accuracy levels.

We conducted 58 otter trawls and 51 beam trawls in the spring, summer and fall of 2009-2012, and incorporated additional data from 88 otter trawls conducted by the Northeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program. We used regionally-grouped abundance, biomass, diversity, and size spectra to assess spatial patterns in the aggregate fish community, and hierarchical cluster analysis to evaluate trends in species assemblages. Our analyses revealed coherent gradients in fish community biomass, diversity and species composition extending from inshore to offshore waters, as well as patterns related to the differing bathymetry of Rhode Island and Block Island Sounds. The fish communities around Block Island and Cox's Ledge are particularly diverse, suggesting that the proximity of hard bottom habitat may be important in structuring fish communities in this area. Species assemblages in Rhode Island and Block Island Sounds are characterized by a combination of piscivores (silver hake, summer flounder, spiny dogfish), benthivores (American lobster, black sea bass, Leucoraja spp. skates, scup) and planktivores (sea scallop), and exhibit geographic patterns that are persistent from year to year, yet variable by season. Such distributions reflect the cross-shelf migration of fish and invertebrate species in the spring and fall, highlighting the importance of considering seasonal fish behavior when planning construction schedules for offshore development projects. The fine spatial scale (10 s of kms) of this research makes it especially valuable for local marine spatial planning efforts by identifying local-scale patterns in fish community structure that will enable future assessment of the ecological impacts of offshore development. As such, this knowledge of the spatial and temporal structure of the demersal fish community in Rhode Island and Block Island Sounds will help to guide the placement of offshore structures so as to preserve the ecological and economic value of the area.

The study explains the steps performed when preparing an environmental management study for the development and exploitation of natural gas. The case study is located offshore, approximately 30 to 50 km north of Alexandria in the Egyptian sector of the Mediterranean. The environmental management study includes a baseline environmental assessment of the site, the project impact on the environment, an environmental impact assessment, mitigation measures, and a monitoring plan. The study examines all aspects and activities of the study area in terms of the impact on the environmental components, provides the best alternatives to preserve the environment, and avoids potential negative effects during the construction and operation of the project to outline the issues that need to be considered when establishing an EMP for gas offshore platforms and other related facilities. However, as each development intervention is unique, a one-size-fits-all approach is not applicable. Key issues may differ from one project to another.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Development of a Practical Soil Constitutive Model Suitable for the Design of Offshore Wind Turbine Foundations in Sand Considering Cyclic Loading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2020,2020,"Offshore wind turbines are subject to cycles of loading and unloading from their environment i.e. wind and waves. This cyclic loading can significantly weaken the foundations over time leading to a reduced loading capacity when compared with a static load of the same magnitude. Structures can fail due to the build-up of plastic strain in the soil over time through successive loading cycles. In addition, there are failure mechanisms caused by liquefaction (where pore water pressure builds up and soil friction decreases). Through laboratory experiments this project will seek to develop a constitutive model of sandy soil under cyclic loading. This will provide a better understanding of the behaviour of sandy soils with cyclic loads applied. Therefore, it should be possible to improve the design of offshore wind turbine foundations. This is of particular significance to the UK as much of the seabed surrounding Britain has at least partial presence of sandy layers, with some areas comprised almost entirely of sandy soil e.g. southern North Sea. Improvements in the design of offshore wind turbine foundations should lead to material and cost savings, helping to drive down the levelised cost of energy.The project methodology will be focussed around gathering results from cyclic triaxial tests. Triaxial tests are a standard industry test used to measure the mechanical response of a soil sample to prescribed stress and/or strain boundary conditions. The cyclic triaxial tests will apply computer controlled cyclic loads to a range of samples prepared with different initial densities and stress histories. The samples will be prepared in the lab, as opposed to testing cored samples from the field due to the tendency of sandy soils to break apart when loads are released. The results will be used to develop and calibrate a constitutive soil model, which will seek to improve the currently available models' shortcomings with respect to cyclic loading. Sandy soils are complex and therefore difficult to define fully with a constitutive model. Existing models prioritise modelling either static or cyclic loads at the expense of reducing accuracy with respect to the other load type. This project is novel in seeking to combine both cyclic and static loads into a single constitutive model.This project is part of the Wind and Marine Energy Systems and Structures (WAMESS) Centre for Doctoral Training and falls within the EPSRC Wind Power, Ground Engineering and Energy research areas. This project will be run in partnership with Fugro, making use of their large commercial soil testing laboratory in Wallingford (near Oxford). The project will work in tandem with another doctoral project of a similar aim, but more focussed on mathematical and computational modelling aspects.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2440655,,,,,,,,University of Oxford,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15371084,,

Due to engineering requirements, they are normally installed at the mean water level (MWL), leading to high risk of ship collisions. In this study, transient response and damage analysis were performed on the grouted connections of monopile OWT when subjected to ship impacts. Taking into account the sandwich construction of the grouted connection of the OWT and the non-linear behaviour of the structure materials, a finite element model of a vessel of 2000-ton displacement collision with a 5 MW monopile OWT was developed using explicit finite element code LS-DYNA. The ship was assumed to strike head-on and at the middle of the grouted connection. Characteristics of the collision system in terms of energy, velocity, impact force and the response of the ship and the grouted connection were analysed. Internal contact forces, stress and effective plastic strain distribution of the grouted connection were discussed. Four phases of the collision process were identified: initial collision, motion towards maximum OWT deflection, towards vessel-OWT separation, and after separation. The ship collision response and damage of the grouted connection were considerably influenced by the strain rate effect of the structure materials. Collided by a ship, even at a low velocity of 2 m/s, the grouted connection for monopile OWT could suffer heavy or major damage. The current analysis sheds light on the dynamic response of grouted connections of monopile OWTs to ship impact. It lays a solid foundation for future analysis on the design of grouted connections of OWTs.",,,,,,,,,18,1,0,0,0,0,19,,,0141-1187,1879-1549,,,,,,,,,,"Dalian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Coastal & Offshore Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R ChinaCharles Sturt Univ, Fac Business Justice & Behav Sci, Engn, Panorama Ave, Bathurst, NSW 2795, AustraliaCOOEC Subsea Technol Co Ltd, Technol Bldg,1067,Nanhai Rd, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",COOEC Subsea Technol Co Ltd,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000436887000014,,

Given the pressures to harness tidal and wave energy, especially in Scottish waters, there is an urgent need to assess population-level impacts on seabird species. With a lack of deployed devices to monitor in areas of importance for seabirds, our approach uses data from scientific literature on seabird ecology and conservation importance likely to influence population vulnerability to  wet renewables in Scottish waters. At this stage however, we can only infer likely interactions with tidal and wave devices. We identify black guillemot, razorbill, European shag, common guillemot, great cormorant, divers and Atlantic puffin as the species most vulnerable to adverse effects from tidal turbines in Scottish waters. We identify divers as the species most vulnerable to adverse effects from wave energy devices in Scottish waters. Wave energy devices seem likely to represent a lesser hazard to seabirds than tidal turbines, and both forms of energy capture seem likely to represent a lower hazard to seabirds than offshore wind farms ( wind-power plants). The indices developed here for Scottish seabird populations could be applied to populations elsewhere. This approach will help in identifying likely impacts of tidal and wave energy deployments on seabirds, and in optimizing deployment of resources for compulsory environmental monitoring.",,,,,,,,,52,2,0,0,34,0,58,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"MacArthur Green Ltd, Glasgow G3 8ND, Lanark, ScotlandUniv Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, ScotlandUniv Highlands & Isl, N Highland Coll, Environm Res Inst, Thurso KW14 7EE, Caithness, Scotland",MacArthur Green Ltd,,,2012-09-26,WOS:000308012200015,,

One typical offshore floating OTEC system uses the temperature difference to drive a heat engine, utilizing a closed-loop Rankine cycle with a working fluid such as ammonia (NH3). Cold water is pumped through a large flexible pipe from approximately 1000m depth to heat exchangers which condense the ammonia vapor. Warm water from the surface is pumped through heat exchangers to evaporate the liquid ammonia to drive the turbine.An OTEC floating platform could be a semisubmersible, a spar, or other typical offshore hull form with a taut or a catenary mooring system. As opposed to oil and gas production platforms, the OTEC system consists of a large diameter cold water pipe (CWP) which will participate in the global performance of the floating platform. Its unique behavior also includes the contribution of CWP entrained water which behaves differently in lateral and vertical directions due to its open bottom design. The hydrodynamic behavior of the large scale cold water pipe is an important consideration in the system design and analysis. The study presented in this work includes the application of a fully coupled analysis program with an accurate cold water pipe dynamic model in OTEC floating system analysis.

Twenty-three C. crysos were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters, and their positions were localized around a petroleum platform complex in the Gulf of Mexico using a hydrophone network. Fish were tracked during August 2005 for 23 d, and home ranges were calculated for individual fish over the daily, diel, and entire study period. Most fish showed a preference for a discrete area within the platform complex: 11 fish had a range centroid near one platform for at least 7 d, and 9 fish had a range centroid near one platform for at least 3 d. Only 3 fish showed no preference for a particular site within the platform complex. Mean core daily range varied from 373 to 2202 m(2), while the 95% daily range was between 3082 and 14 333 m(2). Evidence for diel differences in habitat use was also apparent. Hydrophones detected more transmissions during the day than during the night; however, only 3 fish had significantly larger home ranges during the day than during the night. There was a significant correlation between fish length and both the size of their overall core home range and the size of the 95% daily home range.

Echolocation-click trains were categorized into four phases of the diel cycle: morning, day, evening, and night. Porpoises were present near (<200 m) the platform, and there was a pronounced diel pattern in echolocation activity; the number of porpoise encounters (visits) was greater by night than by day. The number of click trains with a minimum inter- click interval of <10 ms also increased at night. This was confirmed by a comparison of the ratios of feeding buzzes to search- phase clicks (feeding buzz ratios) and an analysis of the changes in pulse-repetition frequencies within each train. A reasonable interpretation of this pattern was that porpoises were feeding below or around the platform at night. The evidence for changes in activity during the morning and evening was less clear, so these may be transitional phases. The pattern of porpoise-echolocation behaviour around this platform is related most probably to the diel activity of their prey. If porpoises cluster regularly around such installations within 500-m shipping exclusion zones, they may be omitted from population surveys. We conclude that offshore installations may play an important role as nocturnal porpoise-feeding stations in an overfished environment, but that further replicated and controlled studies are required.

To estimate the discomfort threshold of pile driving sounds, a porpoise in a quiet pool was exposed to playbacks (46 strikes/min) at five SPLs (6 dB steps: 130-154 dB re 1 mu Pa). The spectrum of the impulsive sound resembled the spectrum of pile driving sound at tens of kilometers from the pile driving location in shallow water such as that found in the North Sea.

At and above a received broadband SPL of 136 dB re 1 mu Pa [zero-peak sound pressure level: 151 dB re 1 mu Pa; t(90): 126 ms; sound exposure level of a single strike (SELss): 127 dB re I mu Pa-2 s] the porpoise's respiration rate increased in response to the pile driving sounds. At higher levels, he also jumped out of the water more often.

In the case of monotonic and slow cyclic lateral loading it is shown that imperfect interface bonding could reduce the moment capacity and may lead to foundation detachment or even uplifting in the case of shallowly embedded caissons. A preliminary comparison of two caisson alternatives has shown that increasing the caisson diameter while maintaining the embedment ratio is more efficient in terms of material resources than increasing the skirt length while keeping the diameter constant. The second part of the study evaluates the response of a soil-foundation-wind turbine interacting system subjected to earthquake shaking. Contrary to an often prevailing impression that seismic effects are insignificant, apparently originating from evaluating the seismic behaviour on the basis of spectral characteristics, it is illustrated that the system kinematics may prove crucial for the response of large wind turbines subjected to simultaneous environmental and seismic loads.

It is therefore essential to investigate submarine landslides for potential tsunami hazard assessment. Three-dimensional seismic data from offshore Brunei have revealed a giant seabed mass deposited by a previous SMF. The submarine mass extends over 120 km from the continental slope of the Baram Canyon at 200 m water depth to the deep basin floor of the Northwest Borneo Trough. A suite of in-house two-dimensional depth-averaged tsunami simulation model TUNA (Tsunami-tracking Utilities and Application) is developed to assess the vulnerability of coastal communities in Sabah and Sarawak subject to potential SMF tsunami. The submarine slide is modeled as a rigid body moving along a planar slope with the center of mass motion parallel to the planar slope and subject to external forces due to added mass, gravity, and dissipation. The nonlinear shallow water equations are utilized to simulate tsunami propagation from deepwater up to the shallow offshore areas. A wetting-drying algorithm is used when a tsunami wave reaches the shoreline to compute run up of tsunami along the shoreline. Run-up wave height and inundation maps are provided for seven densely populated locations in Sabah and Sarawak to highlight potential risks at each location, subject to two scenarios of slide slopes: 2 degrees and 4 degrees. The first wave may arrive at Kudat as early as 0.4 h after the SMF, giving local communities little time to evacuate. Over a small area, maximum inundated depths reaching 20.3 m at Kudat, 26.1 m at Kota Kinabalu, and 15.5 m at Miri are projected, while the maximum inundation distance of 4.86 km is expected at Miri due to its low-lying coast. In view of the vulnerability of some locations to the SMF tsunami, it is important to develop and implement community resilience program to reduce the potential damage that could be inflicted by SMF tsunamis.",,,,,,,,,11,4,0,0,2,0,14,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, George Town 11800, MalaysiaSunway Univ, Sch Math Sci, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor, MalaysiaSunway Univ, Jeffrey Sachs Ctr Sustainable Dev, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor, Malaysia",,,,2017-08-01,WOS:000405561200010,28343360,

Historically, such artificial reefs formed an important component of the socio-economic development of coastal fisheries. In comparison, modern artificial reefs have taken on a variety of forms. The most widely recognized are purpose-build modular artificial reefs designed for the enhancement of fisheries yield, diving, and various other benefits. However, far more common within the Gulf are the large-scale unplanned artificial reefs that have been formed as a result of human activities in the marine system, such as large-scale coastal breakwaters, seawalls, jetties, pipelines, and oil and gas infrastructure. Although there is limited information on the role of these constructions in structuring Gulf marine communities, increasing evidence suggests that abundant and diverse communities of reef fish, coral and other benthos can develop on these structures, with important ecological implications in urbanized coastal areas in the Gulf. However, due to a variety of unintended consequences of artificial reef development such structures may also pose challenges to coastal marine management. We review the current published literature on artificial reefs in the Gulf in order to improve our understanding of the role that these structures play in Gulf coastal ecosystems, and to further develop regional management of artificial reefs. We explore the various types of artificial reef that exist in the Gulf and examine the benefits and challenges that these structures represent for coastal ecology and economics. Such information is essential for our improved understanding and management of these increasingly important ecosystems in the Gulf. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the floating platforms will introduce additional degrees of freedom to the system, which results in much more ultimate and fatigue loads onto the wind turbine structure compared with fixed bottom types. The load issue has been the major design challenge in developing FOWTs.In this paper, we report a novel semi-submersible supporting platform design, named MU support, aiming to improve the dynamic responses and reduce loads for FOWTs. The proposed semi-submersible MU support is mainly composed of one main column attached to the tower and four offset columns. Particularly, instead of simply filled with ballast water, the four columns act as four tuned liquid column dampers (TLCDs), and the oscillating liquid inside the TLCDs is supposed to help improve the dynamic responses of the semi-submersible platform, thus reducing the loads. The sizing of these TLCDs are determined by frequency analysis, and the detailed structural properties for MU support are described in this paper Additionally, in order to better study the damping effects of the TLCDs, the dynamic model of MU support FOWT in the pitch surge-heave plane is derived based on the Lagrangian approach, and free decay simulation test is performed. It can be observed from the results that the introduction of TLCDs will bring more damping to the system dynamics, which is helpful for FOWT load reduction. Note that this is only preliminary study, and future works will comprehensively investigate its hydrodynamic and mooring behaviors of MUsupport, and aero-hydro-servo-elastic numerical simulations or experimental tests should be performed to further verb its effectiveness.",,,,,"38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)","JUN 09-14, 2019JUN 09-14, 2019","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine EngnASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn","Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLANDUniv Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLAND",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2153-4772,,978-0-7918-5889-9,,,,,,,,,"Zhejiang Univ, Inst Ocean Engn & Technol, Ocean Coll, Zhoushan, Peoples R China",,,,2020-03-10,WOS:000513310000054,,

The viewshed model was deployed over a visibility zone covering 54% (223.641 km(2)) of the Baltic Sea space using a database of 63,672 observation points integrated by geospatial data on existing and planned sea uses representing potential visual stressors. Results show that areas of highest potential visual impact are sheltered coastal areas with complex geomorphological features such as barrier islands, peninsulas, straits, archipelagos and lagoons in combination with intensive anthropogenic activity and presence of nature protected areas.

This comes with an elevated risk of blades impacting the tower or surrounding structures due to excessive crane tip motions from wave induced vessel motions. The wind turbine blades are primarily made of composite materials and thus are extremely vulnerable to impact loads causing complex damages and failure modes. One of the most critical damage type for wind turbine blades is delamination because delaminations cannot always be visually detected but can cause significant strength and stiffness reductions. An explicit structural response based approach was proposed in the previous work which is used to derive response based operational limits for single blade lifting operation using floating vessels considering probability of contact/impact and damages in the blade. An assessment of such impact induced damages on the blade was mentioned which includes modelling and predicting damages in the blade for different contact scenarios representing lifting operations in different sea states along with post impact residual strength estimation. This would require an efficient damage assessment methodology which can be utilized in practice with acceptable accuracy along with a reasonable computational cost. In this work, a simplified global-local based damage assessment methodology is presented. The paper focusses on 'shell-to-solid submodelling' based, impact damage prediction along with a brief outline of 'shell-solid coupling' based residual strength study. The paper further presents the submodelling technique for impact investigations on DTU 10 MW blade section for a case when a projectile impacts the leading edge. Intraply damage mode based on Hashin failure criteria and Puck's action plane theory was utilized as VUMAT in Abaqus-Explicit along with surface based cohesive behavior to model the interlaminar failure mode.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Development of a Practical Soil Constitutive Model Suitable for the Design of Offshore Wind Turbine Foundations in Sand Considering Cyclic Loading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2020,2020,"Offshore wind turbines are subject to cycles of loading and unloading from their environment i.e. wind and waves. This cyclic loading can significantly weaken the foundations over time leading to a reduced loading capacity when compared with a static load of the same magnitude. Structures can fail due to the build-up of plastic strain in the soil over time through successive loading cycles. In addition, there are failure mechanisms caused by liquefaction (where pore water pressure builds up and soil friction de-creases). Through laboratory experiments this project will seek to develop a constitutive model of sandy soil under cyclic loading. This will provide a better understanding of the behaviour of sandy soils with cyclic loads applied. Therefore, it should be possible to improve the design of offshore wind turbine foundations. This is of particular significance to the UK as much of the seabed surrounding Britain has at least partial presence of sandy layers, with some areas comprised almost entirely of sandy soil e.g. southern North Sea. Improvements in the design of offshore wind turbine foundations should lead to material and cost savings, helping to drive down the levelised cost of energy.The project methodology will be focussed around gathering results from cyclic triaxial tests. Triaxial tests are a standard industry test used to measure the mechanical response of a soil sample to prescribed stress and/or strain boundary conditions. The cyclic triaxial tests will apply computer controlled cyclic loads to a range of samples prepared with different initial densities and stress histories. The samples will be prepared in the lab, as opposed to testing cored samples from the field due to the tendency of sandy soils to break apart when loads are released. The results will be used to develop and calibrate a constitutive soil model, which will seek to improve the currently available models' shortcomings with respect to cyclic loading. Sandy soils are complex and therefore difficult to define fully with a constitutive model. Existing models prioritise modelling either static or cyclic loads at the expense of reducing accuracy with respect to the other load type. This project is novel in seeking to combine both cyclic and static loads into a single constitutive model.This project is part of the Wind and Marine Energy Systems and Structures (WAMESS) Centre for Doctoral Training and falls within the EPSRC Wind Power, Ground Engineering and Energy research areas. This project will be run in partnership with Fugro, making use of their large commercial soil testing laboratory in Wallingford (near Oxford). The project will work in tandem with another doctoral project of a similar aim, but more focussed on mathematical and computational modelling aspects.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2506453,,,,,,,,University of Oxford,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15402379,,

However, drivers of the horizontal (i.e., latitudinal and longitudinal) and vertical (i.e., position in the water column) distribution patterns of fishes associated with these artificial habitats are not fully understood on a GOM-wide scale. To build upon previous studies on a large spatial scale and focus on species-specific drivers, we conducted 114 submersible rotating drop-camera and water quality sonde surveys at 54 platforms throughout the GOM. We then fitted two sets of binomial generalized additive mixed models integrating environmental and structural (i.e., characteristics of platforms) predictors to encounter/nonencounter data for 17 fish species so as to understand their horizontal and vertical distribution patterns throughout the GOM in platform habitat. Significant predictors for horizontal distribution included distance from shore (for Bermuda Chub Kyphosus saltatrix, Greater Amberjack Seriola dumerili, Vermilion Snapper Rhomboplites aurorubens), salinity (Bermuda Chub, Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus), the number of platforms within 5 km (Blue Runner Caranx crysos, Crevalle Jack Caranx hippos), and dissolved oxygen concentration (Red Snapper). Significant predictors for vertical distribution included temperature (for Atlantic Spadefish Chaetodipterus faber, Bermuda Chub, Blue Runner, Greater Amberjack, Red Snapper), salinity (Greater Amberjack, Red Snapper), dissolved oxygen concentration (Red Snapper), and seafloor depth (Red Snapper). However, the majority of the study species were not influenced by the predictors included in the horizontal (11 of 17 species) and vertical distribution (12 of 17 species) generalized additive mixed models. Thus, many GOM fishes were found to associate with platforms over a relatively wide range of environmental conditions and platform characteristics. This suggests specific environmental conditions and distinct platform characteristics may not be as important as the simple number of available platforms for determining the distributions of many platform-associated fishes in the GOM.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,17,0,21,,,1942-5120,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USAEchol Ltd, Menai Bridge LL59 5HN, Gwynedd, WalesUniv Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USALGL Ecol Res Associates, Bryan, TX 77802 USA",Echol LtdLGL Ecol Res Associates,,,2020-05-14,WOS:000529296400004,,

This study used baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) to compare species richness, fish abundance and size along 42.3 km of subsea pipeline and in adjacent areas of varying habitats. The pipeline is laid in an onshore-offshore direction enabling surveys to encompass a range of depths from 9 m nearshore out to 140 m depth offshore. Surveys off the pipeline were performed across this depth range and in an array of natural habitats (sand, macroalgae, coral reef) between 1 km and 40 km distance from the pipeline. A total of 14,953 fish were observed comprising 240 species (131 on the pipeline and 225 off-pipeline) and 59 families (39 on the pipeline and 56 off-pipeline) and the length of 8,610 fish were measured. The fish assemblage on and off the pipeline was similar in depths of Pristipomoides multidens (goldband snapper), Lutjanus malabaricus (saddletail snapper) and Lutjanus russellii (Moses snapper) among others, and possessed a catch value 2-3 times higher per stereo-BRUV deployment than that of fish observed off-pipeline. Adjacent natural seabed habitats possessed higher abundances of Atule mate (yellowtail scad), Nemipterus spp. (threadfin bream) and Terapon jarbua (crescent grunter), species of no or low commercial value. This is the first published study to use stereo-BRUVs to report on the importance of subsea infrastructure to commercially important fishes over a depth gradient and increases our knowledge of the fish assemblage associated with subsea infrastructure off north-west Australia. These results provide a greater understanding of ecological and fisheries implications of decommissioning subsea infrastructure on the north-west shelf, and will help better inform decision-making on the fate of infrastructure at different depths.

J,,,,,,,,,"PATON, P.","GOLD, M",ASSESSING IMPACTS OF NEARSHORE WIND POWER ON RHODE ISLAND'S NATURAL RESOURCES: MOVEMENT ECOLOGY OF SEADUCKS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Oct 01 2010,2010,"In 2004, Governor Carcieri announced an ambitious plan to substantially reduce Rhode Island's carbon footprint by increasing the use of renewable energy (DOE 2004). The Block Island pilot project would consist of 5-10 wind turbines generating about 12 megawatts (MW) of energy. A second larger wind farm is also proposed for nearshore waters (~15 miles S of Pt Judith) that could be in operation by 2014. However before either of these wind farms can be constructed, according to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA; MMS 2008), federal regulatory agencies (e.g., US Fish and Wildlife Service [USFWS], Army Corps of Engineers [ACOE], Minerals Management Service [MMS]) require baseline assessments of natural resources, including avian populations, that might be affected by wind farm developments. Understanding the movement ecology of sea ducks is one of the key factors delaying the development of the Cape Wind farm north of Nantucket, MA, which has proposed building 130 wind turbines (Mass Audubon 2009). Surprisingly little quantitative information is known about the movement ecology of sea ducks in New England. We propose to implant satellite transmitters into Surf Scoters because this is a high priority species for the Sea Duck Joint Venture (SDJV 2009). There are numerous stakeholders that would be interested in the results of this study. First, the Governor of Rhode Island's intent on developing renewable energy sources in the state. Other state agencies, Department of Environmental Management (DEM) and Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC), are interested in the potential development of nearshore wind resources. In addition, federal agencies (USFWS, BOEM, and ACOE) require baseline data provided by this study under NEPA. Local governments, such at the town council for New Shoreham, are interested in offshore wind resources and potential environmental impacts, thus these data would be informative. Non-government agencies, such at The Nature Conservancy and the Audubon Society of Rhode Island are extremely interested in potential impacts of wind turbines on wildlife, thus this quantitative information would be timely. This project meets two primary goals of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), established by the 2008 Farm Bill. First, these research and associated extension activities focus on assisting the development of a nearshore wind farm in Rhode Island, which would lead to energy independence for the United States; one of the primary goals of NIFA and the USDA's Institute of Bioenergy, Climate, and Environment. Second, this research and extension is designed insure the sustainability of biodiversity, which is also a top priority for NIFA and IBCE.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,0224398; 596338,,,,,,,,UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13042667,,

The red-throated diver (Gavia stellata) has been reported to be sensitive to ship traffic and other anthropogenic pressures and is consequently of high conservation concern. We studied red-throated divers in the German Bight (North Sea) using satellite telemetry and digital aerial surveys with the aim of assessing effects of ship traffic on the distribution and movements of this species during the non-breeding season. Data from the automatic identification system of ships (AIS) were intersected with bird data and allowed detailed spatial and temporal analyses. During the study period, ship traffic was present throughout the main distribution area of divers. Depending on impact radius, only small areas existed in which ship traffic was present on less than 20% of the days. Ship traffic was dominated by fishing vessels and cargo ships, but also wind farm-related ships were frequently recorded. Red-throated divers were more abundant in areas with no or little concurrent ship traffic. Analysis of aerial survey data revealed strong effects of ship speed on divers: in areas with vessels sailing at high speed only a slow resettlement of the area was observed after the disturbance, while in areas with vessels sailing at medium speed the resettlement was more rapid during the observed time period of 7 hours. Data from satellite-tracking of divers suggest that large relocation distances of individuals are related to disturbance by ships which often trigger birds to take flight. Effective measures to reduce disturbance could include channeled traffic in sensitive areas, as well as speed limits for ships traveling within the protected marine area.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,12,0,14,,,0301-4797,1095-8630,,,,,,,,,,"BioConsult SH GmbH & Co KG, D-25813 Husum, GermanyDHI, DK-2970 Horsholm, DenmarkNovia Univ Appl Sci, Ekenas 10600, FinlandJustus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Anim Ecol & Systemat, D-35392 Giessen, GermanyOrnitela UAB, LT-03228 Vilnius, LithuaniaKlaipeda Univ, Marine Res Inst, LT-92294 Klaipeda, Lithuania",BioConsult SH GmbH & Co KGOrnitela UAB,,,2019-11-19,WOS:000494052300004,31539703,

An integration of natural and social sciences research is required by policy-makers to better understand, and manage sustainably, natural changes and anthropogenic activities within particular marine systems. Given the uncertain development of activities in the marine environment, future scenarios assessments can be used to investigate whether marine policy measures are robust and sustainable. This paper develops an interdisciplinary framework, which incorporates future scenarios assessments, and identifies four main types of evaluation needed to integrate natural and social sciences research to support the integrated management of the marine environment: environmental policy and governance assessments; ecosystem services, indicators and valuation; modelling tools for management evaluations, and risk assessment and risk management. The importance of stakeholder engagement within each evaluation method is highlighted. The paper focuses on the transnational spatial marine management of the Dogger Bank, in the central North Sea, a site which is very important ecologically, economically and politically. Current management practices are reviewed, and research tools to support future management decisions are applied and discussed in relation to two main vectors of change affecting the Dogger Bank, namely commercial fisheries and offshore wind farm developments, and in relation to the need for nature conservation. The input of local knowledge through stakeholder engagement is highlighted as a necessary requirement to produce site specific policy recommendations for the future management of the Dogger Bank. We present wider policy recommendations to integrate natural and social sciences in a global marine context. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The installation and operation of these devices can result in conflicts with wildlife. In the marine environment, mammals may avoid wind farms that are under construction or operating. Such avoidance may lead to more time spent travelling or displacement from key habitats. A paucity of data on at-sea movements of marine mammals around wind farms limits our understanding of the nature of their potential impacts. Here, we present the results of a telemetry study on harbour seals Phoca vitulina in The Wash, south-east England, an area where wind farms are being constructed using impact pile driving. We investigated whether seals avoid wind farms during operation, construction in its entirety, or during piling activity. The study was carried out using historical telemetry data collected prior to any wind farm development and telemetry data collected in 2012 during the construction of one wind farm and the operation of another. Within an operational wind farm, there was a close-to-significant increase in seal usage compared to prior to wind farm development. However, the wind farm was at the edge of a large area of increased usage, so the presence of the wind farm was unlikely to be the cause. There was no significant displacement during construction as a whole. However, during piling, seal usage (abundance) was significantly reduced up to 25 km from the piling activity; within 25 km of the centre of the wind farm, there was a 19 to 83% (95% confidence intervals) decrease in usage compared to during breaks in piling, equating to a mean estimated displacement of 440 individuals. This amounts to significant displacement starting from predicted received levels of between 166 and 178 dB re 1 muPa(p-p). Displacement was limited to piling activity; within 2 h of cessation of pile driving, seals were distributed as per the non-piling scenario. Synthesis and applications. Our spatial and temporal quantification of avoidance of wind farms by harbour seals is critical to reduce uncertainty and increase robustness in environmental impact assessments of future developments. Specifically, the results will allow policymakers to produce industry guidance on the likelihood of displacement of seals in response to pile driving; the relationship between sound levels and avoidance rates; and the duration of any avoidance, thus allowing far more accurate environmental assessments to be carried out during the consenting process. Further, our results can be used to inform mitigation strategies in terms of both the sound levels likely to cause displacement and what temporal patterns of piling would minimize the magnitude of the energetic impacts of displacement.

However, tomaintain this push towards green energy providers will need to find more sites to generate power. In recent years therehave been moves towards using offshore wind generation instead of onshore wind farms. Whilst offshore wind has manyadvantages there is potential impact on marine wildlife that needs to be considered. New applications for offshore windfarmsites require a thorough Environmental Impact Assessment and the offshore environment makes it hard to accuratelyassess current marine populations, making this a time-consuming and costly operation.In this research we propose to develop a real-time acoustic monitoring platform that will enable operators to assess a sitefor marine mammal activity at a fraction of the current cost and effort and moreover, produce better and more accurateresults. This will be done by deploying large numbers of novel low cost, low power underwater wireless sensor devices(NanoPAMs) which detect the sounds that marine mammals make to navigate, hunt and communicate. The data from eachNanoPAM is transmitted using acoustic signals over distances up to 10 km to a surface buoy. Since the animals may beable to hear these acoustic signals, the NanoPAMs transmit very low energy acoustic signals which blend into thebackground noise and are also smart enough to wait until animals have left the area before transmitting so as not toinfluence behaviour. The surface buoy then uses radio to send the received data back to shore where it can be visualisedand analysed.On shore, the data collected can be turned into an understanding of the current activity of marine mammals and also tomonitor the ongoing impact of offshore windfarm developments. In future, the system could be rapidly deployed in multiplelocations to help select sites that would minimise the impact on our marine wildlife.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/R014884/1,,,,,,,,Newcastle University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15318756,,

Storm-driven mixing can be considered as a seasonal disturbance regime to demersal communities, characterized by the recurrence of large changes in bottom water temperatures. Black sea bass are a model ubiquitous demersal species in the Middle Atlantic Bight, as their predominantly sedentary behavior makes them ideal for tagging studies while also regularly exposing them to summer storm disturbances and the physiological stresses associated with thermal destratification. To better understand the responsiveness of black sea bass to storm impacts, we coupled biotelemetry with a high-resolution Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). During the summers of 2016-2018, 8-15 black sea bass were released each year with acoustic transponders at three reef sites, which were surrounded by data-logging receivers. Data were analyzed for activity levels and reef departures of black sea bass, and fluctuations in temperature, current velocity, and turbulent kinetic energy. Movement rates were depressed with each consecutive passing storm, and late-season storms were associated with permanent evacuations by a subset of tagged fish. Serial increases in bottom temperature associated with repeated storm events were identified as the primary depressor of local movement. Storm-driven increases in turbulent kinetic energy and current velocity had comparatively smaller, albeit significant, effects. Black sea bass represents both an important fishery resource and an indicator species for the impact of offshore wind development in the United States. Their availability to fisheries surveys and sensitivity to wind turbine impacts will be biased during periods of high storm activity, which is likely to increase with regional climate change.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,4,0,6,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USAUniv Maryland, Horn Point Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Cambridge, MD USASouthern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China",,,,2020-12-22,WOS:000596569200082,33264326,

The ocean provides a largely untapped source of renewable energy. As a result, harvesting electrical power from the wind and tides has sparked immense government and commercial interest but with relatively little detailed understanding of the potential environmental impacts. This study investigated how the sound emitted from an underwater tidal turbine and an offshore wind turbine would influence the settlement and metamorphosis of the pelagic larvae of estuarine brachyuran crabs which are ubiquitous in most coastal habitats. In a laboratory experiment the median time to metamorphosis (TTM) for the megalopae of the crabs Austrohelice crassa and Hemigrapsus crenulatus was significantly increased by at least 18 h when exposed to either tidal turbine or sea-based wind turbine sound, compared to silent control treatments. Contrastingly, when either species were subjected to natural habitat sound, observed median TTM decreased by approximately 21-31% compared to silent control treatments, 38-47% compared to tidal turbine sound treatments, and 46-60% compared to wind turbine sound treatments. A lack of difference in median TTM in A. crassa between two different source levels of tidal turbine sound suggests the frequency composition of turbine sound is more relevant in explaining such responses rather than sound intensity. These results show that estuarine mudflat sound mediates natural metamorphosis behaviour in two common species of estuarine crabs, and that exposure to continuous turbine sound interferes with this natural process. These results raise concerns about the potential ecological impacts of sound generated by renewable energy generation systems placed in the nearshore environment.",,,,,,,,,38,2,0,0,28,0,43,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Auckland, Leigh Marine Lab, Auckland 1, New Zealand",,,,2013-01-09,WOS:000312290800099,23240063,

Many proposed wind farms overlap with the distribution of seals, and sound from pile driving has the potential to cause auditory damage. We report on a behavioural study during the construction of a wind farm using data from GPS/GSM tags on 24 harbour seals Phoca vitulina L. Pile driving data and acoustic propagation models, together with seal movement and dive data, allowed the prediction of auditory damage in each seal. Growth and recovery functions for auditory damage were combined to predict temporary auditory threshold shifts in each seal. Further, M-weighted cumulative sound exposure levels [cSELs(M-pw)] were calculated and compared to permanent auditory threshold shift exposure criteria for pinnipeds in water exposed to pulsed sounds. The closest distance of each seal to pile driving varied from 47 to 405km, and predicted maximum cSELs(M-pw) ranged from 1707 to 1953 dB re 1Pa(2)-s for individual seals. Comparison to exposure criteria suggests that half of the seals exceeded estimated permanent auditory damage thresholds. Prediction of auditory damage in marine mammals is a rapidly evolving field and has a number of key uncertainties associated with it. These include how sound propagates in shallow water environments and the effects of pulsed sounds on seal hearing; as such, our predictions should be viewed in this context.Policy implications. We predicted that half of the tagged seals received sound levels from pile driving that exceeded auditory damage thresholds for pinnipeds. These results have implications for offshore industry and will be important for policymakers developing guidance for pile driving. Developing engineering solutions to reduce sound levels at source or methods to deter animals from damage risk zones, or changing temporal patterns of piling could potentially reduce auditory damage risk. Future work should focus on validating these predictions by collecting auditory threshold information pre- and post-exposure to pile driving. Ultimately, information on population-level impacts of exposure to pile driving is required to ensure that offshore industry is developed in an environmentally sustainable manner.We predicted that half of the tagged seals received sound levels from pile driving that exceeded auditory damage thresholds for pinnipeds.

We reviewed 1252 published research articles and extracted or calculated effect sizes for 12 drivers from 82 independent studies within 26 articles that met our inclusion criteria. We used a fixed-effect model to calculate the absolute value of the mean effect size of each driver by age class studied and pooled across age classes to estimate effects on the overall abundance of red snapper. Habitat complexity and intra-specific competition had large effects on overall abundance and juvenile abundance, while habitat type and protection from predators showed medium to large effects on age 0 recruits and juvenile red snapper, and the mean effect of all drivers studied for adult red snapper were small or had no effect on abundance. Our results provide systematic support for the role of density-dependent mechanisms (habitat quality and availability, competition, predation) in shaping the regional abundance of red snapper, particularly during the juvenile stages. Sensitivity analyses indicated that issues with non-independence (e.g. within-article correlation), between-study heterogeneity, and publication bias influenced the magnitude and certainty of effect size estimates in a subset of drivers. Thus, our meta-analytical review also highlights the need for more empirical research on certain drivers (e.g. temperature, hypoxia) to improve our understanding of the factors that shape the regional abundance of red snapper.",,,,,,,,,7,1,0,0,6,0,8,,,0960-3166,1573-5184,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USAUniv S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USAUniv Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv Southern Mississippi, Gulf Coast Res Lab, Ocean Springs, MS 39564 USAOcean Conservancy, Gulf Restorat Program, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USACouncil Watershed Hlth, Pasadena, CA 91105 USAGeorge Mason Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USAJackson State Univ, Jackson, MS 39217 USAAuburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USASan Diego State Univ Imperial Valley, Calexico, CA 92231 USAUniv Cent Florida, UCF Marine Turtle Res Grp, Dept Biol, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",Ocean ConservancyCouncil Watershed Hlth,,,2020-07-01,WOS:000541216500001,,

A postal survey was conducted to investigate fishers' attitudes towards offshore energy extraction and any influential factors in terms of fishing experience and practice, association membership, location, and knowledge of offshore renewable energy installations.

While previous research into the effect of industrial noise on whale behavior and distribution has noted significant responses, this research has often proceeded from a parametric statistical framework. To account for the presence of spatially autocorrelated and intercorrelated data, we propose a suite of spatial analysis techniques to assess the distribution of bowhead whales relative to oil exploration activities. Using random resampling techniques and Mantel tests, we analyzed the distribution of bowhead whales around active drilling rigs in 1993. Results from the resampling tests indicated that whales were distributed farther from the drilling rig than they would be under a random scenario. Results from the Mantel tests indicated that in 1993, the spatial pattern of bowhead whale distribution was highly correlated with distance from the drilling rig, indicating that the presence of the drilling rig resulted in a significant temporary loss in available habitat.

Here we present the first assessment of marine bird vulnerability to potential OWEI in the California Current System portion of the U.S. Pacific Outer Continental Shelf (POCS). Using population size, demography, life history, flight heights, and avoidance behavior for 62 seabird and 19 marine water bird species that occur in the POCS, we present and apply equations to calculate Population Vulnerability, Collision Vulnerability, and Displacement Vulnerability to OWEI for each species. Species with greatest Population vulnerability included those listed as species of concern (e.g., Least Tern [Sternula antillarum], Marbled Murrelet [Brachyramphus mannoratus], Pink-footed Shearwater [Puffins creatopus]) and resident year-round species with small population sizes (e.g., Ashy Storm-Petrel [Oceanodroma homochroa], Brandt's Cormorant [Phalacrocorax penicillatus], and Brown Pelican [Pelecanus occidentalis]). Species groups with the greatest Collision Vulnerability included jaegers/skuas, pelicans, terns and gulls that spend significant amounts of time flying at rotor sweep zone height and don't show macro-avoidance behavior (avoidance of entire OWEI area). Species groups with the greatest Displacement Vulnerability show high macro-avoidance behavior and low habitat flexibility and included loons, grebes, sea ducks, and alcids. Using at-sea survey data from the southern POCS, we combined species-specific vulnerabilities described above with at-sea species densities to assess vulnerabilities spatially. Spatial vulnerability densities were greatest in areas with high species densities (e.g., near-shore areas) and locations where species with high vulnerability were found in abundance.

Its main goals are the analysis and prediction of different hydrometeorological characteristics and also the estimation of the impact of wave and ice forcing on the sea oil and gas facilities to provide their safety. The project foresees the creation of the parallel algorithm of author's data assimilation approach earlier derived theoretically together with the basic data assimilation method known as Ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF). The series of numerical experiments with the large-scale coupled ocean-ice-atmosphere model configured previously on SuperComputer Lomonosov-2 will be performed with and without data assimilation. As the results of those experiments the long-term and seasonal variability is planning to be evaluated in the regional and global scales with the main focus on Arctic region of Russian Federation. High-resolution modeling of sea flows near offshore oil and gas facilities is an important tool for safety assessment in their design and operation. The numerical high-resolution model taking into account the dynamics of the waves on the sea surface has been created and methods to assess wave loading into stationary offshore oil and gas facilities have been proposed in the Project 2014. In Project 2017 there will be continued to study the models for wave interacting with the objects with the complex shape, partially or totally submerged, such as the oil and gas offshore drill platforms or the subsea pipelines. In addition to the interaction of sea flows with stationary facilities, the dynamics of floating objects, such as an oil tanker, as well as the dynamics of fluid oscillations inside the tanker will be studied. For this problem there will be computed the loads on the walls of the tanker, the probability of its failure or rollover as a result of the fluid oscillation inside the tanker. Numerical modeling of the impact of the ice formations on the offshore of oil and gas facilities as the basis of the fundamental laws of continuum mechanics allow us getting more accurate values of loads and to optimize the ensuring of their safety costs, both in exploitation and in the design of such facilities. There will be performed the verification and improvement of the earlier developed in Project 2014 continuum mechanics of ice deformation and fracture and the software for numerical simulation of the ice formations impact on the offshore oil and gas facilities. The Investigation of various modes of interaction between ice formations and offshore oil and gas facilities depending on their shapes, drift speed, mechanical properties of the ice and it non-homogeneity using the modified software will be carried out.

The tectonic stress field is crucial to the study of tectonics, engineering, marine geology, seismology and the exploration of marine resources. In the exploration of marine resources, it is often necessary to study the mechanics and deformations of the rock in the oceanic crust. An iso-elevation line map of the fold's structural layer is a basic way to indicate the features and shapes of the fold, which is more important - especially in the field of exploratory marine petroleum engineering. To draw this map, though, requires a great deal of data, for structural profiles and drilling. It is very difficult to obtain these data, especially in mountainous regions or areas where mineral exploration has recently begun. This greatly limits the progress of marine exploratory engineering. In this paper, the author proposes a new theory and method for calculating the structural stress field using the composite quantitative data of remote sensing information on circular structures and related linear structures, in order to approximate the iso-elevation line map of local structures on the basis of the phase-separation analysis of remote sensing information field and the theory of elastic mechanics.

There were significant correlations between the individual growth rates of laboratory-maintained saithe and concentrations of white muscle RNA expressed as mu-g RNA mg-1 protein, mg RNA mg-1 DNA and as mg RNA g-1 muscle. Growth rate was also correlated with the activities of the enzymes citrate synthase, cytochrome oxidase and lactate dehydrogenase. RNA concentrations decreased with increasing body size, and weight-corrected estimates of RNA concentrations for a standard-sized individual were determined from the scaling relationships. RNA concentrations expressed in three different ways gave similar estimates of the growth rate for two samples of wild saithe, one from around an oil platform and the other from the west coast or Scotland. RNA concentrations were correlated with aerobic enzyme levels in oil-platform fish, although the growth rate estimates of the same wild fish were lower when expressed as a function of aerobic enzyme levels, than when expressed as a function of lactate dehydrogenase concentration.

To properly account for the pile-soil interaction and the rigid pile behavior of large-diameter piles, lateral soil stiffness was derived using the finite element software Plaxis 3D.To verify the preliminary design, FLS analyses were done using the SIMO-RIFLEX computational tool. As the water depth increases, the contribution of hydrodynamic loads to fatigue damage is found to be larger. A method for predicting total fatigue damage using fewer representative sea states was introduced: a fatigue Damage Parameter (FDP) was established to correlate fatigue damage to environmental condition by means of thrust, significant wave height (Hs) and wave peak period (Tp), and to select representative conditions. Using at least 30% of the total number of conditions resulted in at least 90% accuracy in damage prediction. (C) 2017 The Authors.

New methods of in situ oil and lubricant efficiency monitoring systems have been introduced for a wide variety of mechanical systems, such as automobiles, aerospace aircrafts, ships, offshore wind turbines, and deep sea oil drilling rigs. These methods utilize electronic sensors to monitor the byproduct effects in a mechanical system that are not indicative of the actual remaining lifecycle and reliability of the oils. A reliable oil monitoring system should be able to monitor the wear rate and the corrosion rate of the tribo-pairs due to the inclusion of contaminants. The current study addresses this technological gap, and presents a novel design of a tribo-corrosion test rig for oils used in a dynamic system. A pin-on-disk tribometer test rig retrofitted with a three electrode-potentiostat corrosion monitoring system was used to analyze the corrosion and wear rate of a steel tribo-pair in industrial grade transmission oil. The effectiveness of the retrofitted test rig was analyzed by introducing various concentrations of contaminants in an oil medium that usually leads to a corrosive working environment. The results indicate that the retrofitted test rig can effectively monitor the in situ tribological performance of the oil in a controlled dynamic corrosive environment. It is a useful method to understand the wear-corrosion synergies for further experimental work, and to develop accurate predictive lifecycle assessment and prognostic models. The application of this system is expected to have economic benefits and help reduce the ecological oil waste footprint.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,0,8,,,1996-1944,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Nevada, Dept Mech Engn, Reno, NV 89557 USABournemouth Univ, Dept Design & Engn, NCEM, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, EnglandUniv Nevada, Nevada Inst Sustainabil, Reno, NV 89557 USA",,,,2017-11-23,WOS:000414639000040,28956819,

Some populations are of high conservation concern, but they also cause agricultural damage, are quarry for hunters, and may be particularly sensitive to infrastructure developments. In Bulgarian Dobrudzha, large wintering populations of greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons and red-breasted geese Branta ruficollis feed in agricultural land, and cause management dilemmas. We developed linear models to investigate fine- and meso-scale foraging habitat selection of geese foraging on winter wheat in the area, and used these models to make suggestions for zoning landscape use in order to reduce conflict and conserve geese. Habitat selection was scale-dependent. Geese selected fields that were near to major roosts and had low proximity to roads and tree-lines, which may be a proxy for hunting disturbance. We found some evidence for selection of wheat fields with high nutritional quality. Within fields, geese strongly avoided features which cause landscape 'clutter': power-lines, tree-lines and wind-turbines, but primarily over distances of less than a few hundred metres. Optimal management might involve encouraging goose populations to feed in areas close to roosts, by means of agri-environmental measures and creation of hunting-free refuges. This would allow efficient use of agri-environment funds, might reduce conflict with farmers, and would mean that infrastructure development-notably wind farms-could be sited at greater distance from roosts with relatively minor impact on foraging habitat availability.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,5,0,10,,,0960-3115,1572-9710,,,,,,,,,,"Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, Slimbridge GL2 7BT, Glos, EnglandBulgarian Soc Protect Birds, POB 50, Sofia 1111, BulgariaRSPB Ctr Conservat Sci, RSPB, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, EnglandSoftlab, Julio A Roca 695,Piso 1, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Wildfowl & Wetlands TrustBulgarian Soc Protect BirdsSoftlab,,,2018-01-11,WOS:000419149800009,,

Multipurpose platforms, which combine more than one of these renewable resources, have been proposed as a sustainable approach. One type of multipurpose platforms is the hybrid wind-wave systems, in which a single platform combines the exploitation of offshore wind and wave energy. In this paper a novel hybrid system that integrates an oscillating water column (OWC) wave energy converter (WEC) with an offshore wind turbine on a monopile substructure is considered. The main objective of this paper is to define and test a simplified version of the WEC sub-system of this hybrid energy converter. An experimental campaign was carried out to characterise the hydrodynamic response of a 1:37.5 scale model of the WEC sub-system under regular and irregular waves. On the basis of the data from the experimental campaign, the hydrodynamic response of the WEC sub-system is characterised in four steps: (i) through an incident and reflected wave analysis (IRWA), to characterise the interaction between the device and the waves; (ii) through the capture width ratio, to study the performance of the device; (iii) through response amplitude operators (RAOs) of the free surface elevation and pneumatic pressure inside the OWC chamber, to study the effects of the incident waves on the device response; and (iv) through the wave run-up on the device. The results from this multifaceted analysis lead to the proof of concept of this novel hybrid system, supporting its feasibility to be combined with offshore wind substructures; but also to characterise its behaviour and interaction with the wave field, essential to full understanding of the benefits of hybrid systems.",,,,,,,,,60,2,0,0,1,0,60,,,0196-8904,1879-2227,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Plymouth, Sch Engn, Reynolds Bldg, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",,,,2018-09-12,WOS:000442972500025,,

For instance, the maximum pitching amplitude of a floater for floating offshore wind turbine is required to be less than a few degrees. On the other hand, ocean waves contain abundance of untapped renewable energy with very high power density. Integration of floating platform with wave energy converters while reducing the structure interaction becomes significant for offshore development. In this paper, control of wave energy converters on reducing the pitch motion of a floating platform is studied. Firstly, mathematical model of the whole system is proposed. The control of wave energy converters leads to solve a constrained optimization problem. Secondly, hybrid model predictive control is presented to synthesize the controller. Finally, numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller. It is shown that the reduction of pitch motion of the platform and the wave energy extraction are compatible. (C) 2016 IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Water injection systems are continuously treated to control bacterial contamination, but some bacteria that cause souring and corrosion can persist even after different treatments have been applied. Our aim was to increase our knowledge of the bacterial communities that persist in the water injection systems of three offshore oil platforms in Brazil. To achieve this goal, we used a culture-independent molecular approach (16S ribosomal RNA gene clone libraries) to analyze seawater samples that had been subjected to different treatments. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the bacterial communities from the different platforms were taxonomically different. A predominance of bacterial clones affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria, mostly belonging to the genus Marinobacter (60.7%), were observed in the platform A samples. Clones from platform B were mainly related to the genera Colwellia (37.9%) and Achromobacter (24.6%), whereas clones obtained from platform C were all related to unclassified bacteria. Canonical correspondence analyses showed that different treatments such as chlorination, deoxygenation, and biocide addition did not significantly influence the bacterial diversity in the platforms studied.

A combination of indices (Shannon-Wiener diversity, Pielou evenness, BO2A, AMBI benthic indices) and modelling (Ecopath models) generated Ecological Network Analysis indices were used to detect the dumping operations effects. ENA indices showed that dumping operations appear to have a relatively limited impact on the structure and flow pattern of the local food web. In fact, only small variations between the two sites are revealed by a comparison of ENA indices between the impacted and non-impacted zone. This result could be explained by the fact that the Bay of Seine is historically characterized by a high level of human activities, which have led to an increase in resilience through time to face these multiple pressures. AMBI and BO2A indices (of the sediment fauna) did not allow a clear distinction between impacted and nonimpacted zone while species richness, abundance, biomass and Shannon-Wiener diversity index values were significantly higher in the non-impacted zone which is in accordance with the small variations of ENA indices between the two zones and revealed a local and limited impact.

The implementation of the EU Birds Directive in German offshore waters requires special protection of divers that comprise mainly Red-throated and Black-throated G. arctica Divers. An important first step concerning the protection was the establishment of two Special Protection areas for birds in the EEZ of the North and Baltic Seas in 2004. Anthropogenic activities at sea, such as the construction of offshore wind farms or ship traffic, have strong impacts on divers. In the course of the ongoing marine spatial planning it is particularly important to improve the knowledge on distribution patterns and phenology of divers in the German part of the North Sea.This publication presents the most recent analysis of spatio-temporal patterns of divers in the German North Sea. By merging data from scientific projects and environmental impact studies, the data basis could be considerably improved. Divers were recorded by ship-based and aerial surveys during 2000 to 2013. Distribution patterns on a 1 km x 1 km grid were interpolated using Generalized Additive Models.The first nameable aggregations of divers during the course of the year are found in the area of East Frisia during October. Abundance values increase constantly during the following weeks. Eventually, divers are found in the whole coastal zone of the German North Sea during the winter months. Areas of main abundance shift seawards during spring with high density areas occurring in and around the Special Protection Area Eastern German Bight off the island of Sylt. Several wind farm sites overlap with hot spots of diver distribution. The mean spring population of divers in the German North Sea was calculated at 20,000 individuals for the period 2002 to 2013. Numbers in spring did not significantly increase or decrease over this period.The most recent data on diver abundance reflect certain regional, annual variability that can most likely be explained by varying abundance in bentho-pelagic fish stocks as well as by variances in the hydrodynamic systems. The core aggregation of divers during spring could constantly be found within the region of the Special Protection Area Eastern German Bight over the course of the last years. However, most recent data still underline that the core area extends west outside the borders of the protected area.

A random sample of 1,059 sport divers was selected from dive charter boat records; 614 divers took trips to the Flower Gardens Banks National Marine Sanctuary and 445 divers in proportion to the known number of non-Flower Gardens trips by coastal region. An 11-page mail questionnaire was used to collect social and economic data from the sample of divers. Of the 1,059 questionnaires mailed, 528 were returned usable for an overall effective response rate of 56.2%. About 256 (56% of those who went diving in Texas marine waters in the previous 12 months) indicated they took one or more trips in the previous 12 months to artificial reefs in Texas offshore waters. This paper will focus on the group of sport divers who used artificial reefs. Artificial reefs included manmade materials deployed as bottom reefs, wrecks, and standing oil and gas platforms. Most divers participated in activities such as night diving (81%), underwater photography (53%), wreck diving (52%), and marine identification (52%); only 25% participated in spear fishing. Two estimates of sport diver offshore trip days (1,985 and 5,953) were multiplied by the average per trip expenditure for Texas residents ($162) yielding estimated total expenditures (direct economic impact) in coastal communities of $261,439 to $784,106. Total expenditures in coastal communities by non-residents of Texas were considerably less ($58,885 to $176,606). The overall economic impacts of artificial reef diving in Texas where dive charter boats were used to access offshore reefs are presented in terms of changes in total output, income, and total employment. This paper excluded private boat divers who used artificial reefs offshore and charter and private boat divers accessing the Flower Gardens Banks National Marine Sanctuary. The overall economic impact of sport diving in Texas would be higher if these other segments were included.

Footage was analysed from across the northern and central North Sea to examine relationships between faunal community compositions and pipelines and their protective coverings. The complex habitat of concrete and Link-lok mattresses had the highest numbers of observable taxa. Differences in community composition were largely due to varying proportions of common epilithic species.

We investigated the effects of three impacts, i.e. sand extraction, dredge disposal and offshore wind energy exploitation, on the soft-bottom macrobenthic assemblages in the Belgian part of the North Sea. We found similar diversity-disturbance responses, mainly related to the fact that different impacts caused similar environmental changes. We observed a sediment refinement which triggered a shift towards a heterogenic, dynamic (transitional) soft-bottom macrobenthic assemblage, with several species typically associated with muddy sands. This led to a local unexpected biodiversity increase in the impacted area. On a wider regional scale, the ever increasing human impacts might lead to a homogenization of the sediment, resulting in a more uniform, yet less diverse benthic ecosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the face of increasing numbers of offshore wind farms knowledge about the environmental conditions in which maximum call rates occur, is needed for mitigation measures.In this first long-term study at an off shore site in the southern North Sea we investigated the effect of weather on the frequency of flight calls of three thrush-species at an illuminated platform. Flight calls were registered automatically during three autumn migration seasons. Besides generally higher call rates from 5 to 2 h before until 6 h after midnight, call rates increased with tailwinds, a change of the tailwind component during the first part of the night, off shore crosswinds and very high humidity.A monitoring programme is suggested that could help to reduce mass mortalities at illuminated structures.",,,,,,,,,29,1,2,0,29,0,42,,,0908-8857,,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Avian Res Vogelwarte Helgoland, DE-26386 Wilhelmshaven, Germany",Inst Avian Res Vogelwarte Helgoland,,,2012-04-18,WOS:000301707700013,,

However, data collection at sea is time consuming and surveys are carried out over several consecutive days for efficiency reasons. This study investigates the validity of aggregating those data over time to estimate a spatial variogram that is representative for spatial correlation in species abundance. For this purpose we simulate four-day surveys of seabird count data that contain spatial and temporal correlation arising from temporal changes in the spatial pattern of environmental conditions. Estimates of the aggregated spatial variogram are compared to a variogram that would arise when data were collected over a single day. The study reveals that, under changing environmental conditions over surveys days, aggregating data over a four-day survey increases both the non-spatial variation in the data and the scale of spatial correlation in seabird data. Next, the effect of using an aggregated variogram on the statistical power to test the significance of an impact is investigated. The impact concerns a case of establishing an offshore wind farm resulting in seabird displacement. The study shows that both overestimation and underestimation of statistical power occurs, with power estimates differing up to a factor of two. We conclude that the spatial variation in seabird abundance can be misrepresented by using temporally aggregated data.

In addition, between 1000 MW (megawatts) and 2600 MW of marine renewable energy generating capacity could be achieved in Scotland using wave and tidal power devices. However, there are negative environmental impacts associated with marine renewable energy. Intense noise is produced during pile driving, drilling and dredging operations with potential consequences for cetaceans. There are also increases in vessel activities during exploration, maintenance and construction with association risks of disturbance and collisions. Some underwater devices will be large and may be positioned in arrays across the habitats that cetaceans frequent.

These structures provide hard-bottom habitat in areas previously dominated by sand or mud, so they have the potential to alter species distributions or serve as stepping-stones between other hard-bottom habitats. It is thus important to understand what factors influence the composition and abundance of benthic fauna recruiting at these sites. We examined recruitment to hard substrata (fouling panels) deployed on sand at various distances from a large rocky reef (similar to 60 m isobath) on the southern Oregon coast in 2014-2015. Recruitment was dominated by the acorn barnacle Hesperibalanus hesperius. For the majority of the study period in 2014, an anti-cyclonic eddy was present near the deployment sites. However, anomalously high recruitment of H. hesperius during August - early October 2014 coincided with dissipation of the eddy, slower bottom currents, and a positive convergence index, suggesting that H. hesperlus larvae from the adjacent area may have been accumulated and retained near our study sites. Other sessile species, including hydroids and bryozoans, recruited to the fouling panels in low abundances, and most of these species have long-range dispersal and fast growth. Mobile invertebrates observed on the fouling panels included gastropods and nudibranchs, most of which also have long-range dispersal and fast growth, and are predators as adults. Thus, a community with two trophic levels assembled on the fouling panels in a relatively short time period (< 12 weeks). None of the common hard-bottom species from the adjacent rocky reef recruited to the panels, suggesting that there is a specialized assemblage of species that can exploit hard-bottom habitats surrounded by sandy plains.

Avian collisions with wind turbines have received wide attention but reliable predictions remain elusive. Existing predictive models consider behavioural factors such as group movement only implicitly and require accurate site-specific data to produce predictions, making them difficult to translate between locations. Here we introduce an individual-based modelling approach to describe group interactions with obstacles that incorporates aspects of collective motion to simulate and quantify likely avoidance behaviour. We quantify the effect of group size on the probability of an individual colliding with a fixed obstacle, and investigate the roles of both navigational efficiency and group cohesion. We show that, over a wide range of model assumptions and parameterisations, social interactions have a significant and potentially large effect on collision risk; in contrast to previous models, collision risk is typically a non-linear function of group size. These results show that emergent behaviour induced by social interactions can have important effects on the metrics used to inform management and policy decisions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This process must consider impacts to marine ecosystems to meet regulatory requirement and for best environmental practice. However, there is a paucity of information globally on the ecosystem value of these structures, despite the many thousands that are installed throughout our oceans. This study provides the first assessment of fish assemblages and habitats formed by colonising invertebrates on oil and gas wellheads and associated infrastructure in depths of 78-825 m on the north west shelf of Western Australia. Video footage was obtained from Remotely Operated Vehicles deployed by industry on 25 wellhead structures, with six surveyed in each of four distinct depth zones: 78-85 m, 125-135 m, 350-395 m and 490-550 m, and one in 825 m depth. A total of 7278 individual fish from 60 species and 35 families were observed. Commercially important lutjanid (snapper) and epinephelid (grouper) species were common and most abundant on well infrastructure to depths of 135 m, but were absent in depths > 350 m. An as yet unidentified species of roughy, recorded here as Gephyroberyx sp. was the most common fish species observed on well infrastructure in depths > 350 m. Two speckled swellsharks (Cephaloscyllizon speccum), believed to be endemic to north-west Australia, were observed for the first time in situ. Numerous fish species were observed at depths beyond their known limits and two IUCN vulnerable species were recorded: the grey nurse shark (Carcharias taurus; 135 m depth) and the round ribbontail ray (Taeniura meyeni; 78 m depth). Fish assemblages and colonising invertebrate habitats present on wellheads and associated infrastructure were strongly influenced by depth, age and height of the structures. Older, taller wellheads in depths < 135 m possessed greater abundances of groupers, snappers, site-attached reef species, and transient pelagic fish species. Beyond 350 m depth, the number of species and total fish abundance declined markedly, as did the percent cover of ascidians, black/octocorals, sponges and Gorgonocephalidae (basket stars) observed growing on the infrastructure. Deeper structures were characterised by an abundance of Gephyroberyx sp. and, while these structures had less colonising invertebrate coverage in general, crinoids (490-550 m) and crustacea (barnacles; 350-395 m) were dominant at these depths. With very little known about marine ecosystems in depths > 100 m, or about wellheads as a type of subsea structure, this study demonstrates the ecological value of ROV footage obtained during industry operations and is indicative of the importance of subsea oil and gas infrastructure as a habitat for fish, and potentially as structures with value to fisheries.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,25,0,31,,,0278-4343,1873-6955,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, AustraliaWoodside Energy, GPO Box D188, Perth, WA 6840, Australia",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000441486200002,,

The parts of the pipeline and seafloor surveyed were situated in waters 95-235 m deep. Some sections of the surveyed pipe were covered with both sessile and motile invertebrates, such as sea anemones (Metridium cf. farcimen) and sea urchins (Allocentrotus fragilis), sea stars (particularly Hippasteria cf. spinosa and Stylasterias cf. forreri), basket stars (Gorgonocephalus eucnemis), spot prawns (Pandalus platyceros), and king crabs (Paralithodes californiensis). Based on differences in fish assemblages, four habitats (shallow and deep pipeline and shallow and deep seafloor) were categorized. Fish densities along the shallow portion of the pipeline were about seven times higher than on the adjacent seafloor and densities along the deep pipeline portion were nearly six times that of the deeper seafloor. Along the pipeline, rockfishes comprised 84% of the fishes and included 22 species. Unidentified sanddabs (probably most or all Citharichthys sordidus), forming 33.2%, and combfishes (Zaniolepis frenata and Z. latipinnis), comprising 19% of the total, were most often observed on the seafloor. Most of the fishes living on the pipeline were either juveniles of such larger taxa as blackgill (Sebastes melanostomus), flag (S. rubrivinctus), and vermilion (S. miniatus) rockfishes, cowcod (S. levis), and lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), or diminutive species such as halfbanded (S. semicinctus) and stripetail (S. saxicola) rockfishes, combfishes (Zaniolepis spp.), and poachers (Family Agonidae). Higher densities of fishes were often noted in areas of the pipeline that had been undercut. Of particular interest were the relatively high densities of juvenile cowcod along the deeper parts of the pipeline, densities that were far higher than any seen at over 80 natural outcrops and at ten platforms. We suggest that, in the process leading to oil platform and pipeline decommissioning, it is important to understand the role that human-made structure plays as fish habitat.",,,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,44,0,63,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,,2005-07-01,WOS:000230779200007,,

Considering the existing levels of anthropogenic pressures on coastal fish populations it is becoming increasingly important for developers and environmental regulators to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing fish assemblages. Improving our ability to assess such fish populations in close proximity to structures will assist in increasing this knowledge. In the present study we provide the first trial use of Baited Remote Underwater Stereo-Video systems (stereo BRUVs) for the quantification of motile fauna in close proximity to offshore wind turbines. The study was conducted in the Irish Sea and finds the technique to be a viable means of assessing the motile fauna of such environments. The present study found a mixture of species including bottom dwellers, motile crustaceans and large predatory fish. The majority of taxa observed were found to be immature individuals with few adult individuals recorded. The most abundant species were the angular crab (Goneplax rhomboides) and the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). Of note in this study was the generally low abundance and diversity of taxa recorded across all samples, we hypothesise that this reflects the generally poor state of the local fauna of the Irish Sea. The faunal assemblages sampled in close proximity to turbines were observed to alter with increasing distance from the structure, species more characteristic of hard bottom environments were in abundance at the turbines (e.g. Homarus gammarus, Cancer pagarus, Scyliorhinus spp.) and those further away more characteristic of soft bottoms (e.g. Norwegian Lobster). This study highlights the need for the environmental impacts of offshore renewables on motile fauna to be assessed using targeted and appropriate tools. Stereo BRUVs provide one of those tools, but like the majority of methods for sampling marine biota, they have limitations. We conclude our paper by providing a discussion of the benefits and limitations of using this BRUV technique for assessing fauna within areas close to offshore windfarms.

Although partially submerged horizontal circular cylinders can be found in many offshore and marine structures, few works have investigated the influence of their positions beneath the free surface and the resulting wave force. The present work aimed to numerically study the wave force acting on a fixed horizontal circular cylinder near the free surface for different depths. The wave flow was modeled using a viscous model available in the StarCCM+ software using a two-dimensional numerical wave tank. The governing equations were solved using the finite volume in an unstructured mesh. A circular cylinder with a diameter (D) of 0.10 m and a regular wave with a steepness (H/L) of 0.025 were used in the present study. In this case, the cylinder diameter is much smaller than the wave length. Three different submerged depths were investigated, and the numerical results were compared with experimental data extracted from Dixon [1]. Good agreement was found for the first two cylinder positions (z(c)/D = 0 and -0.3). For the last case (z(c)/D = -0.5), a phase shift was observed.

According to our best-fitting model, flight frequency increased during low tidal stages and during the chick-rearing phase, was higher where nesting and foraging habitat were separate than when they were contiguous, and increased with air temperature at some locations. Additionally, flight frequency through risk areas 10 m differed by study site. We found that the center points of piping plover flight paths were clustered by territory, indicating that birds tended to commute to foraging areas using pair-specific routes.

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was initiated in June 2006. However during the scoping of the EIA and the public hearing of the EIA Programme, the lack of essential environmental information was revealed. Because of that, several special studies were performed in 2006-2008. In parallel, a number of technical amendments to the project were made. The paper is focusing on the results of EIA and of related environmental studies. The possible environmental and socio-economical impacts and necessary mitigation measures are discussed. As a result, the two of the initially proposed five sections were excluded from the wind park, whereas the rest three of them were suggested to be moved into deeper and more distant locations. These implemented amendments would decrease the total output of Hiiumaa offshore wind park up to 594-730 MW.

An important aspect relates to the erosion of bottom material around the foundation of the wind turbines, caused by the local increase of the wave and current induced flow velocities by the pile's presence. Typically, the expected scour has a considerable impact on the stability and dynamic behavior of the wind turbine and a scour protection is placed to avoid erosion of the soil close to the foundation. Although much experience exists on the design of scour protections around bridge piers (which are placed in a current alone situation), at present, little design guidelines exist for the specific case of a scour protection around a monopile foundation subjected to a combined wave and current loading.This paper describes the derivation of a static design formula to calculate the required stone size for a scour protection around a monopile foundation in a combined wave and current climate. Due to the difficult physical processes involved in flow disturbance and displacement of bed protection material at the base of a foundation, the formula is based on the results of an experimental model study which is described in this paper. A linear relationship was found between the critical bed shear-stress tau(cr) and the bed shear-stress caused by current tau(c), and waves tau(w) respectively. When applying the formula for a typical situation in the North Sea, a significant reduction of the required stone size is obtained, compared to existing design criteria. In part 2, following this paper (De Vos et al., in preparation), an optimization of the design procedure is obtained by allowing limited stone motion for top layer stones. This is obtained by adding a damage factor to the design formula, which leads to significantly smaller stone diameters and thus a more economical approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve this, Time Depth Recorder (TDR) and Global Location Sensor (GLS) tags were deployed on individuals from several European locations. Due to an incidental mortality, one set of tags was retrieved early. The single set of tags recorded activity from June to August 2018. The TDR collected records for 14 d, providing the first ever biologging data on RTL foraging in Europe. The bird was tagged 90 km from the coast; therefore, it only used freshwater lakes and was never recorded entering saltwater. The individual mostly undertook shallow dives, with maximum and mean depths of 20 m and 5.4 m, respectively. Foraging constituted 22.9% of total activity during the sampling period.

The addition of artificial hard substrates (e.g. shipwrecks and wind turbine foundations) to soft-sediment sandy bottoms is a pervasive example of an anthropogenic habitat change. To investigate the importance of hard substrate habitats for demersal fish species, we studied the spatio-temporal variability for two commercially important species, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and pouting (Trisopterus luscus), from 2009 to 2011 at three different habitats in the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS), i.e. windmill artificial reefs (WARs), shipwrecks and sandy bottoms. Our results showed that population densities of both species were highly enhanced at the hard substrate habitats in comparison to the sandy sediments. The highest catch-per-unit effort values for both species were recorded around the WARs, which indicated distinct aggregation around the wind turbine foundations. In addition, the observed aggregation at the hard substrates differed between seasons. Highest population densities were observed in summer and autumn, i.e. the most intensive feeding period for both fishes.We conclude that the distribution and behaviour of Atlantic cod and pouting is affected by the presence and complexity of artificial hard substrates on the seabed.

We compiled line transect data from 15 shipboard surveys (June 2012-April 2014), along with associated remotely sensed habitat data, in the lower Mid-Atlantic Bight off the coast of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, USA. We implemented a recently developed hierarchical community distance sampling model to estimate the seasonal abundance of 40 observed marine bird species. Treating each season separately, we included six oceanographic parameters to estimate seabird abundance: three static (distance to shore, slope, sediment grain size) and three dynamic covariates (sea surface temperature [SST], salinity, primary productivity). We expected that avian bottom-feeders would respond primarily to static covariates that characterize seafloor variability, and that surface-feeders would respond more to dynamic covariates that quantify surface productivity. We compared the variation in species-specific and community-level responses to these habitat features, including for rare species, and we predicted species abundance across the study area. While several protected species used the study area in summer during their breeding season, estimated abundance and observed diversity were highest for nonbreeding species in winter. Distance to shore was the most common significant predictor of abundance, and thus useful in estimating the potential exposure of marine birds to offshore development. In many cases, our expectations based on feeding ecology were confirmed, such as in the first winter season, when bottom-feeders associated significantly with the three static covariates (distance to shore, slope, and sediment grain size), and surface-feeders associated significantly with two dynamic covariates (SST, primary productivity). However, other cases revealed significant relationships between static covariates and surface-feeders (e.g., distance to shore) and between dynamic covariates and bottom-feeders (e.g., primary productivity during that same winter). More generally, we found wide interannual, seasonal, and interspecies variation in habitat relationships with abundance. These results show the importance of quantifying detection and determining the ecological drivers of a community's distribution and abundance, within and among species, for evaluating the potential exposure of marine birds to offshore development.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,15,0,15,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USACUNY Coll Staten Isl, Dept Biol, Staten Isl, NY 10314 USABiodivers Res Inst, Portland, ME 04103 USAUniv Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Idaho Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Coll Nat Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",Biodivers Res Inst,,,2016-09-01,WOS:000383358000016,27755708,

Intense, directional selection can affect reproduction and lead to a gene pool dominated by relatively few genotypes. A loss of haplotype diversity (h) in the mitochondrial genome in populations of meiobenthic, harpacticoid copepods around offshore oil platforms has been linked to lethal and sublethal responses to factors proximal to offshore oil platforms. However, it was not possible to determine if the effects were related directly to increased concentrations of contaminants produced by drilling at the platforms. An experiment was designed to test whether populations of Nitocra lacustris Schmankevitsch (Copepoda: Harpacticoida) would lose haplotype diversity over 3 generations following exposure to sediment-associated hydrocarbons. Haplotype diversity was estimated by comparing restriction fragment length polymorphisms generated from mitochondrial DNA amplified from individual copepods. An additional component of the study was to determine the effects of population size on estimates of diversity. Haplotype diversity could be underestimated by using too few individuals, because random genetic drift in very small populations could cause lower diversity even in the absence of strong selection. The relationship between sample size and h was determined by randomly sub-sampling, at different sample sizes, a large data set collected for two copepod species. Cultures treated with phenanthrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, experienced lower adult survival, fewer surviving offspring per female, and lower haplotype diversity relative to control cultures. After the first generation, mortality declined, but larval survival and haplotype diversity did not change in subsequent generations. Diversity was slightly underestimated due to assaying too small a number of individuals, but could not account for all of the differences between treatments. Despite mortality, populations in culture were not reduced to the point where random drift seemed to have a significant effect. These results support the hypothesis that loss of mtDNA diversity in naturally occurring populations of Harpacticoida may serve as a marker for negative effects of exposure to xenobiotic contaminants.

The stage of reproductive development as determined by visual inspection or histological analysis was rarely significantly different between near-field and far-field sites. Tissues were examined histologically to determine the prevalence and intensity of parasitism and disease. If a difference in parasitism or pathology existed. individuals collected far-from the platforms typically had higher prevalences while individuals living near-to the platforms usually had higher intensities. Parasitism and disease had little effect on stage of reproductive development except at MU-A85 where individuals with increased disease and parasitism also had decreased reproductive development. Variations in infection intensity were not due to differences in age structure of populations. Larger, older individuals were not consistently more heavily parasitized.Trend in reproductive stage and population health did not follow trends in environmental contamination; the fewest significant differences were observed at the most contaminated platforms. Patterns of differences in parasitism, disease and reproductive effort between the near and far-field stations were platform specific, indicating that the physical and chemical characteristics unique to each platform probably control reproductive effort and levels of disease and parasitism in populations living there. The influence of structure, a variable common to all platforms, did not exert an overriding influence. Mobile taxa such as shrimp exhibited near-field/far-field differences as frequently as the less mobile species such as starfish. Thus, mobile epifauna maintain discrete populations over long-enough time periods to develop different population histories. Shallow-water sites were more likely to exhibit platform-specific near-field/far-field differences in population structure suggesting that trends in water depth and the intensity of seasonality may explain the apparent uniqueness of each platform's effect on population structure and health.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,14,1,16,,,1434-2944,,,,,,,,,,,"Texas Dept Hlth, Seafood Safety Div, Bacliff, TX 77518 USARutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, Haskin Shellfish Res Lab, Port Norris, NJ 08349 USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,,,2000-01-01,WOS:000087416900010,,

Seabird use of wind energy is an under-appreciated aspect of seabird ecology.

We used cluster analysis to partition 104 seabird species into morphological groupings based on degree of divergence in morphology from Pennycuick's standard seabird, with subgroups evident among and within flappers, glide-flappers, and flap-gliders. Gliders, sea-anchor soarers and soarers showed no such divergence in morphology within their respective groups. Morphological grouping was in accord with foraging ecology, facilitating foraging behavior. Seabird flight height and behavior varied among groups and subgroups and changed as a function of wind speed and direction relative to travel, with the probability of more gliding and flying above 10 m increasing as wind speed increased. Most of the glide-flappers, flap-gliders and gliders, especially, would be highly vulnerable to offshore wind-generating facilities, as their flight heights bring them well within the blade-swept zone of typical turbines when winds are strong, and their more prevalent gliding makes them less maneuverable than flappers.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,19,0,27,,,1018-3337,2074-1235,,,,,,,,,,"HT Harvey and Associates Ecol Consultants, 983 Univ Ave,Bldg D, Los Gatos, CA 95032 USA",,,,2016-01-22,BCI:BCI201600151119,,

The expanse of water covered by the research included the planned location of the wind farm as well as adjacent areas. A series of 15 investigative cruises were undertaken from the beginning of October to the beginning of May. The period of observations was divided into five seasons: early autumn, late autumn, winter, early spring and late spring. The standard method of counting birds on transects in the form of strips reaching 300 m from the ship was used in the research, as well as the 'snapshot' technique (scan with bands transect with snapshot technique). Additional observations were made from a point on the shore. In the study area maritime birds are present in low or moderate densities, with localized clusters.

Communities near wind energy developments are also concerned with social and economic impacts, as well as impacts on aesthetics, historical sites, and recreation and tourism. Lack of a systematic, widely accepted, and balanced approach for measuring the potential damage to wildlife, habitats, and communities continues to leave wind developers, regulators, and other stakeholders in an uncertain position. This paper explores ecological risk-based management (RBM) in wind energy development for land-based and offshore wind installations. This paper provides a framework for the adaptation of ecosystem-based management to wind energy development and examines that framework through a series of case studies and best management practices for applying risk-based principles to wind energy. Ten case studies indicate that wind farm monitoring is often driven by regulatory requirements that may not be underpinned by scientific questions. While each case applies principles of adaptive management, there is room for improvement in applying scientific principles to the data collection and analysis. Challenges and constraints for wind farm development to meet RBM framework criteria include collecting sufficient baseline and monitoring data year-round, engaging stakeholder facilitators, and bringing together large and diverse scientific teams. The RBM framework approach may provide insights for improved siting and consenting/permitting processes for regulators and their advisors, particularly in those nations where wind energy is still in the early development stages on land or at sea.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,0,7,,,,2071-1050,,,,,,,,,,"Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, 1100 Dexter Ave N 500, Seattle, WA 98109 USAPacific Northwest Natl Lab, 902 Battelle Blvd, Richland, WA 99352 USANorwegian Inst Nat Res, Hogskoleringen 9, N-7034 Trondheim, NorwayMarine Scotland, St Andrews House,Regent Rd, Edinburgh EH1 3DG, Midlothian, ScotlandNatl Renewable Energy Lab, 18200 CO-128, Boulder, CO 80303 USASTRIX, Rua Roberto Ivens,1314 1 Sala 15, P-4450251 Matosinhos, PortugalRoyal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Vautier St 29, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",Marine ScotlandNatl Renewable Energy LabSTRIX,,,2021-01-12,WOS:000594576400001,,

Recently, a remarkable interest is developing concerning underwater sound effects, especially in aquaculture facilities, with experimentation of musical stimuli or various noises caused by pumps or filter systems on behavior and stress responses of fish in culture conditions. With the increase of urbanization and progressive development of marine industries, more and more pressure from human-generated (anthropogenic) underwater sound pollution may threaten marine mammals, fish species and invertebrates from underwater noises that in terms might be called as Underwater Noise Pollution.

In this report, the potential for chronic PAH exposure in fish is reported, by measurement of recalcitrant, higher molecular weight PAHs in tissues of fish previously investigated for PAH metabolites in bile. A total of 34 PAHs (20 PAHs, 11 alkylated PAHs, and 3 polycyclic aromatic thiophenes) were targeted. In addition, legacy contaminants-polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs),-and current contaminants, polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) linked to endocrine disruption, were measured by gas chromatography with electron-capture or mass spectrometric detection, to form a more complete picture of the contaminant-related status of fishes at oil production platforms in the Southern California Bight. No hydrocarbon profiles or unresolved complex hydrocarbon background were found in fish from platforms and from natural areas, and concentrations of aliphatics were low less than 100 nanograms per gram (ng/g) per component). Total-PAH concentrations in fish ranged from 15 to 37 ng/g at natural areas and from 8.7 to 22 ng/g at platforms. Profiles of PAHs were similar at all natural and platform sites, consisting mainly of naphthalene and methylnaphthalenes, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene. Total-PCB concentrations (excluding non-ortho-chloro-substituted congeners) in fish were low, ranging from 7 to 22 ng/g at natural areas and from 10 to 35 ng/g at platforms. About 50 percent of the total-PCBs at all sites consisted of 11 congeners: 153 > 138/163/164 > 110 > 118 > 15 > 99 > 187 > 149 > 180. Most OCPs, except dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)-related compounds, were not detectable or were at concentrations of less than 1 ng/g in fish. p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDE) ranged from 5.6 to 33 ng/g at natural areas and from 17 to 76 ng/g at platforms, and comprised greater than 90 percent of the total-DDT concentrations at all sites. The only detectable PBDE congeners were PBDE-47 and PBDE-100, the total concentrations of which ranged from 0.4 to 1.8 ng/g at natural areas and from 0.5 to 3.0 ng/g at platforms. Total-PAH, -PCB, and -DDT concentrations were compared with other Southern California Bight studies involving shoreline mussel, (Mytilus Species, Kimbrough and others, 2008) and near shore sampling (Pacific sanddab, Schiff and Allen, 2000). At corresponding sites, only total-PCB concentrations agreed well with results from this study; total-DDT concentrations were generally much lower than concentrations documented in previous studies for samples collected nearer to shore by sewage treatment outfalls or 14 years earlier or closer in time to when DDT production was halted (1970). Natural areas and platforms in the Bight do not appear to be affected by harbor or urban pollution. Platforms were no more polluted than the nearby natural areas, with these locations exhibiting only low concentrations of PAHs, PCBs, DDTs, and other contaminants.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0196-1497,,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Reston, VA, 20192, USA",,,,2013-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15302011278,,

Here, we use carbon and nitrogen isotopes in tissues of biota from two offshore oil platforms to estimate the importance of phytoplankton and platform-associated macroalgae and epiphytic microalgae to the diets of platform-dwelling consumers. Although the consumption of macroalgae was indicated for small, mobile consumers including crabs, amphipods, and harpacticoid copepods, both a Bayesian mixing model and temporal changes in isotope composition identified phytoplankton as the most important basal resource for these consumers. Sessile suspension-feeding barnacles and oysters consumed phytoplankton and epiphytes, and probably redirected large amounts of pelagic production to other consumers. Secondary consumers including syllid polychaetes and the blennies, Molly Miller Scartella cristata and Tessellated Blenny Hypsoblennius invemar, exhibited a distinct contribution from epiphytes although large ranges in all potential basal resources were observed. Elemental and isotope analysis of the gut contents of individuals indicated that the nektonic Gray Triggerfish Balistes capriscus was omnivorous, directly consuming reef-derived macroalgae and epiphytes as well as animal tissue. Although we found that reef-derived resources entered benthic and nektonic food webs surrounding platforms, phytoplankton was the dominant basal resource fueling platform-dwelling communities at the time of our study, and no consumer studied specialized on a diet of red macroalgae. If these findings are generally representative, platform-derived benthic algae would not be integral to food-web function on artificial reefs, and reef function should be similar in areas both favorable to and unfavorable to in situ algal growth.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,21,0,28,,,1942-5120,,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2014-01-29,WOS:000329369900006,,

A spring bloom of phytoplankton occurred during the 90-d suspension period in 1995. Hydrocarbons isolated from the 1995 suspended mussels showed very high concentrations of both biogenic hydrocarbons and very long-chain n-alkanes from C-20 to C-32, initially thought to be petrogenic. Both types of hydrocarbons were either not detected or were only present in trace amounts in the mussels suspended in 1994 at similar sites. The biogenic hydrocarbons in the 1995 mussels were apparently of planktonic origin, from the spring bloom, and were dominated by heneicosahexaene (21:6), followed by pristane, heptadecane, and various monounsaturated and polyunsaturated phytenes, heptadecenes, nonadecenes and heneicosenes. They could be readily hydrogenated to yield the basic alkanes. The 1995 mussels suspended within 1 km from the oil well platform were probably slightly tainted by petrogenic hydrocarbons, as evidenced by the detection of phytane and high concentrations of total aliphatic hydrocarbons, whereas the mussels suspended 10 km from the platform showed only high concentrations of biogenic hydrocarbons and the novel long-chain n-alkanes. The occurrence of an unusual phytoplankton bloom during the suspension period severely interfered with the petroleum monitoring role of mussels by altering the mussel hydrocarbon profiles through the accumulation into and probably selective depuration of xenobiotic hydrocarbons from the mussel tissues.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,7,1,11,,,0025-3162,,,,,,,,,,,"TECH UNIV NOVA SCOTIA,CANADIAN INST FISHERIES TECHNOL,HALIFAX,NS B3J 2X4,CANADAJOHN PARSONS & ASSOC BIOL CONSULTANTS,DARTMOUTH,NS B2Y 3Y5,CANADA",JOHN PARSONS & ASSOC BIOL CONSULTANTS,,,1996-09-01,WOS:A1996VK87000016,,

Of the most abundant species tagged (cabezon Scorpaenichthys marmoratus, vermilion rockfish Sebastes miniatus, widow rockfish Sebastes entomelas, copper rockfish Sebastes caurinus, and greenspotted rockfish Sebastes chlorostictus), widow rockfish showed a high probability of being detected at platforms over a 2-year period. Vermilion rockfish emigrated away from the shallower Platform Gilda (64 m) faster than vermilion rockfish tagged at the deeper Platform Grace (93 m). Ten tagged individuals (eight vermilion rockfish, one copper rockfish, and one lingcod Ophiodon elongatus) moved between platforms (range 5-15 km) and/or natural habitat, although a majority moved from a shallower platform to a deeper one. These movements further support evidence that (1) many reef-associated rockfishes make ontogenetic shifts to deeper water and (2) shallower platforms export fishes faster than deeper platforms. There was no indication of seasonal emigration, but there was evidence for seasonal differences in activity for vermilion rockfish, widow rockfish, and greenspotted rockfish.

The U.S. electricity generation system, about 70 % fossil fuels and 20 % nuclear, is undergoing a sea change (EIA 2010). Two difficulties stand out in siting any utility-scale power plant and its delivery infrastructure anywhere; the potential catastrophic risks associated with oil and gas drilling and nuclear technologies, and the need to quickly expand low carbon, cost-effective energy supplies to meet expected demand under climate change scenarios in the next decade. Offshore wind has the potential to play a pivotal role in the low carbon energy supplies needed on the east coast and Great Lakes of the U.S. (DOE 2008, Musial and Ram 2010). The Department of Energy (DOE) estimated that the U.S. electricity sector could avoid 825 million tons of CO2 by integrating 20% wind energy (including 54 GW of offshore wind) into the U.S. electricity system by 2030 (DOE 2008a). The benefits of wind energy in mitigating climate change and other energy issues need to be considered together with the negative impacts in estimating and comparing risks involved in different energy sources (NRC 2009a). The European Community has shown the pathway with gigawatt-scale deployments operating, under construction, and planned in the Baltic, North and Irish Seas (Global Offshore Wind Farms Database 2011). This article argues that a new paradigm with a more systematic approach, beyond the engineering, policy, and financial market barriers, is essential to better inform gigawatt-scale wind decision makers and stakeholders. The diverse community of players and decision makers in the offshore wind industry requires a robust, integrated knowledge base. The knowledge base can help avoid surprises that impede and delay siting projects while laying the base for effective and fair approaches for communities along our coasts and Lakes. A new paradigm is proposed, an integrated risk analysis, as an effective approach to complex siting and community engagement issues.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,0,11,,,0309-524X,2048-402X,,,,,,,,,,"Ram Power LLC, 1925 16th ST,NW,Suite 302, Washington, DC 20009 USA",Ram Power LLC,,,2011-06-01,WOS:000210784000002,,

Up to now, extensive efforts for development of design tools for FOWTs have been made, and nowadays several design tools are available. Needless to say, it is of utmost importance that the engineering design tools have been verified and validated for the real physical phenomena before being applied to real designs/projects with confidence. Much efforts have thus been made as code-to-code comparisons and by validations using model test data. Validations of the design tools using full-scale field data for FOWTs have also been made, but available open literatures are quite limited, particularly for design-driving extreme cases. In this paper, we describe the analysis of the dynamic response of a 2-MW spar-type FOWT at the time of typhoon attack in the actual sea area. The central atmospheric pressure of the typhoon at the closest time was 965 hPa, the maximum instantaneous wind speed at the hub height was 52.2 m/s, and the maximum significant wave height was 6.9 m. The dynamic responses under the typhoon environment are numerically simulated by using the time-series records of the wind speed, the wind direction, the wave height, the wave direction, the current speed, and the current direction which were acquired during the typhoon passing through close to the FOWT. Then the simulated motion responses are compared with the measured motion responses for the same durations. By the comparisons, the numerical simulation tool which was used for the design of the FOWT has been partially validated. It has also been confirmed that the spatial coherence of the wind speed has a significant effect for the platform motions, particularly for yaw motion.y",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,0,17,,,0029-8018,1873-5258,,,,,,,,,,"TODA CORP, Chuo Ku, Kyobashi 1-18-1, Tokyo 1040031, JapanKyushu Univ, Dept Marine Syst Engn, Nishi Ku, Motooka 744, Fukuoka 8190395, JapanHitachi Ltd, Kokubuncho 1-1-1, Hitachi, Ibaraki 3168501, Japan",TODA CORP,,,2021-01-19,WOS:000598977600109,,

The wind inflow is unsteady and fluctuating in space and time. The floating platform has six Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) of movement. The aerodynamics of the rotor is subjected to many unsteady phenomena: dynamic inflow, stall, tower shadow and rotor/wake interactions. Stateof-the-art aerodynamic models used for the design of wind turbines may not be accurate enough to model such systems at sea. For HAWTs, methods such as Blade Element Momentum (BEM) [1] have been widely used and validated for bottom fixed turbines. However, the motions of a floating system induce unsteady phenomena and interactions with its wake that are not accounted for in BEM codes [2]. Several research projects such as the 0C3 [3], 0C4 [4] and 005 [5] projects focus on the simulation of FHAWTs. To study the seakeeping of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs), it has been chosen to couple an unsteady free vortex wake aerodynamic solver (CACTUS) to a seakeeping code (InWave [6]). The free vortex wake theory assumes a potential flow but inherently models rotor/wake interactions and skewed rotor configurations. It shows a good compromise between accuracy and computational time. A first code-to-code validation has been done with results from FAST [7]on the FHAWT 0C3 test case [3] considering the NREL 5MW wind turbine on the OC3Hywind SPAR platform. The code-to-code validation includes hydrodynamics, moorings and control (in torque and blade pitch).

In fact, the effect of locally important oceanographic features such as the offshore autumnal transport on the distribution of planktonic cnidarians has long been overlooked in this region. Because of this, the present study aimed to analyse the spatial patterns of planktonic cnidarian assemblages in the southern Gulf of Mexico during the autumn of 1998, when particularly intense conditions of convergence, offshore water transportation and productivity were recorded. The assemblages were described in terms of their composition, abundance (volume), diversity, dominance and equitability. Cluster (Bray-Curtis index) and ordination (multidimensional scaling (MDS)) analysis were performed in order to link the observed distribution of species with the environmental parameters.Results: Sixty-eight taxa were recorded, with Koellikerina fasciculata and Muggiaea atlantica representing new records for the region. The holoplanktonic species Diphyes dispar, Abylopsis spp., Liriope tetraphylla, Diphyes bojani, Aglaura hemistoma, Muggiaea kochi, Chelophyes appendiculata and Eudoxoides mitra were dominant with respect to abundance (ml/1000 m(3)) and frequency of occurrence and defined the differences among the groups of stations. Four groups of sampling stations were identified: (A) the mouth of the Grijalva-Usumacinta system, (B) the Campeche Bank, (C) the area of offshore oil rigs and (D) the continental shelf off Tabasco and associated oceanic waters. The parameters that defined the groups of stations were zooplankton volume, sampling station depth, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration.Conclusions: Planktonic cnidarians are useful as indicators of water masses, since the observed zonation was congruent with the surface circulation patterns that are present during the autumn (offshore transportation) and the presence of particular local environmental conditions, including those at the mouth of the Grijalva-Usumacinta system and those associated with the area of oil rigs. We would expect that similar conditions of strong offshore transport would lead to a similar horizontal stratification in the assemblages of planktonic cnidarians in other parts of the world, driven mainly by salinity, oxygen, depth and zooplankton gradients.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,10,0,13,,,0716-078X,0717-6317,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Politecn Nacl, Escuela Nacl Ciencias Biol, Dept Zool, Ecol Lab, Mexico City 11340, DF, MexicoUniv Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Posgrad Ciencias Biol, Mexico City 04360, DF, Mexico",,,,2014-11-28,WOS:000343826400002,,

Capturing that resource is part of a broader effort to reduce CO(2)emissions. While few turbines have been constructed in U.S. waters, over a dozen currently planned offshore wind projects have the potential to displace marine birds, potentially leading to effective habitat loss. We focused on three diving birds identified in Europe to be vulnerable to displacement. Our research aimed to determine their potential exposure to areas designated or proposed for offshore wind development along the Atlantic OCS. Methods Satellite tracking technology was used to determine the spatial and temporal use and movement patterns of Surf Scoters (Melanitta perspicillata), Red-throated Loons (Gavia stellata) and Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus), and calculate their exposure to each offshore wind area. We tagged 236 adults in 2012-2015 on the Atlantic OCS from New Jersey to North Carolina; an additional 147 birds tagged in previous tracking studies were integrated into our analyses. Tracking data were analysed in two-week intervals using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models to develop composite spatial utilization distributions. For each species, these distributions were then used to calculate the spatio-temporal exposure to each offshore wind area. Results Surf Scoters and Red-throated Loons were exposed to offshore wind areas almost exclusively during migration because these species were distributed among coastal and inshore waters during winter months. In contrast, Northern Gannets ranged over a much larger area, reaching farther offshore and south in winter, thus exhibited the greatest exposure to extant offshore wind areas. Conclusions Results of this study provide better understanding of how diving birds use current and potential future offshore wind areas on the Atlantic OCS, and can inform permitting, risk assessment and pre- and post-construction impact assessments of offshore energy infrastructure.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,,,,,,,,,"Biodivers Res Inst, Portland, ME 04103 USAUS Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Laurel, MD USAUniv Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Orono, ME USAMem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF, CanadaUS Fish & Wildlife Serv, Div Migratory Birds, Hadley, MA USA",Biodivers Res Inst,,,2020-10-13,WOS:000573913200001,,

In this perspective, both the potential for combining different renewable technologies, and the impact associated to such development should be considered in the context of the existing pressures.

Renewable energy sources, including wind energy, hydropower energy, geothermal energy, solar energy, biomass energy and ocean power, have received increasing attention as alternative means of meeting global energy demands. After Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in March 2011, more and more countries are having doubt about the safety of nuclear plants. As a result, safe and renewable energy sources are attracting even more attention these days. Wind energy production, with its relatively safer and positive environmental characteristics, has evolved in the past few decades from a marginal activity into a multi-billion dollar industry. In this research, a comprehensive evaluation model is constructed to select a suitable location for developing a wind farm. The model incorporates interpretive structural modeling (ISM), benefits, opportunities, costs and risks (BOCR) and fuzzy analytic network process (FANP). Experts in the field are invited to contribute their expertise in evaluating the importance of the factors and various aspects of the wind farm evaluation problem, and the most suitable wind farm can finally be generated from the model.

However, these models do not predict how a species may react to that noise. In this paper, the results from a modified predictive underwater noise model and a hydrodynamic model are used in an individual based model (IBM) to predict the impacts on cod (Gadhus moruha) from noise generated during a pile driving event at an offshore wind farm in Liverpool Bay, UK. The model included cod which were sensitive to noise and those which were insensitive ('deaf'). Fish movement was from the outer bay into the Dee Estuary, a known feeding ground. The IBM indicated that the cod which could hear took up to 7 days longer to reach their destination than the cod which were deaf. This technique could be used during the consenting process for offshore projects to better understand the potential impact on marine species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Multibeam bathymetry data show concentric 'halos of holes' extending hundreds of meters around the wrecks. These halos at 5 wreck sites between 16 and 111 yr old consist of hundreds of tightly spaced depressions with diameters of up to 10 m. Seafloor imagery clearly indicates a biogenic origin of the holes. The halos of the 2 youngest wrecks (<25 yr) have fewer holes than older wrecks, suggesting a relationship between wreck age and excavation activity. Conversely, the size of a wreck does not appear to control the sediment turnover activity. Holes are comparatively long-lived, and some of them are actively maintained by bioturbation activity. The spatial distribution of holes is consistent with resource depletion by a central-place forager, albeit on yearly to decadal time scales. Tow-camera data show that some holes support diverse sessile faunal assemblages of sponges, soft corals, and hard corals in an otherwise flat seafloor devoid of sessile fauna. The (to date unknown) bioturbator(s) are thus allogenic habitat engineers. The systematic occurrence of halos around wrecks suggests that 'the ecosystem wreck' extends beyond the spatial confines of the hull of a wreck to the seafloor, by a distance 10-fold greater than the size of a wreck itself.

Scraped samples from five such platforms (water depth 16-61 m) yielded 104 species of benthic foraminifera 44 of them with attached individuals. Among the obligate sessile species, Dyocibicides biserialis and Planorbulina mediterranensis were especially widespread.

Looking forward, offshore wind- energy infrastructure (OWEI) has the potential to produce a significant proportion of the power needed to reach our Nation's renewable energy goal. Offshore wind- energy sites can capitalize open areas within Federal waters that have persistent, high winds with large energy production potential. Although there are few locations in the California Current System (CCS) where it would be acceptable to build pilemounted wind turbines in waters less than 50 m deep, the development of technology able to support deep- water OWEI (>200 m depth) could enable wind- energy production in the CCS. As with all humanuse of the marine environment, understanding the potential impacts of wind- energy infrastructure on the marine ecosystem is an integral part of offshore wind- energy research and planning. Herein, we present a comprehensive database to quantify marine bird vulnerability to potential OWEI in the CCS (see http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/ F79C6VJ0). These data were used to quantify marine bird vulnerabilities at the population level. For 81 marine bird species present in the CCS, we created three vulnerability indices: Population Vulnerability, Collision Vulnerability, and Displacement Vulnerability. Population Vulnerability was used as a scaling factor to generate two comprehensive indicies: Population Collision Vulnerability (PCV) and Population Displacement Vulnerability (PDV). Within the CCS, pelicans, terns (Forster's (Sterna forsteri), Caspian (Hydroprogne caspia), Elegant (Thalasseus elegans), and Least Tern (Sternula antillarum)), gulls (Western ( Larus occidentalis) and Bonaparte's Gull (Chroicocephalus philadelphia)), South Polar Skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), and Brandt's Cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus) had the greatest PCV scores. Brown Pelican (Pelicanus occidentalis) had the greatest overall PCV score. Some alcids (Scripps's Murrelet (Synthliboramphus scrippsi), Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus), and Tufted Puffin (Fratercula cirrhata)), terns (Elegant and Least Lern), and loons (Yellow-billed (Gavia adamsii) and Common Loon (G. immer)) had the greatest PDV scores. Ashy Storm-Petrel (Oceanodroma homochroa) had the greatest overall PDV score. To help inform decisions that will impact seabird conservation, vulnerability assessment results can now be combined with recent marine bird at-sea distribution and abundance data for the CCS to evaluate vulnerability areas where OWEI development is being considered. Lastly, it is important to note that as new information about seabird behavior and populations in the CCS becomes available, this database can be easily updated and modified.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0196-1497,,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA, 22092, USA",,,,2017-06-29,ZOOREC:ZOOR15307044405,,

Selecting nights with suitable weather conditions for migration can be critical for a bird's survival. The aim of this study is to unravel the weather-related bird migration decisions, by providing a descriptive analysis of the synoptic weather conditions over the North Sea on nights with very high and low migration intensities and compare these conditions to the prevailing climatology. For this study, bird radar data were utilized from an offshore wind farm off the Dutch coast, in the North Sea. The study suggests that atmospheric conditions clear of rain and frontal systems, dominated by high pressure systems and tailwinds in spring and sidewinds in autumn are most suitable for nights of intense migration. Differences in temperature, relative humidity and cloud cover appear less significant between intense and low migration nights, suggesting that these variables exert only a secondary role on migration.

So far, threshold levels are lacking which may identify anthropogenic impact as considerable adverse effects<, for birds. Here we propose such thresholds levels for seabirds and birds migrating across the sea. It is generally inadequate to focus on effects of single events of impact in that special area only. Effects of all events of impact (i.e. of all wind farms) have to be assessed cumulatively, because they influence bird populations altogether. If applicable, more strict rules as prescribed by law have to be followed in protected areas. For birds living in marine areas, i.e. overwintering birds, birds staging during spring and fall migration, moulting birds, oversummering birds and those breeding at nearby coasts but foraging offshore, our proposal is that a bird population is considerably adversely affected when the total impact results in a habitat loss for 1 % of the national population in the respective season. National population sizes are known or will be calculated soon for all 35 species occurring regularly in German sea waters. When this 1 % threshold level is reached for a species through one or more events of impact, any additional impact concerning this species has to be judged as to be of considerable impact. Migrating birds will face the danger of collision once wind farms are constructed. We define the threshold level for actively migrating birds as a value of acceptable additional mortality. How much a mortality rate is allowed to increase without leading to population decline depends on species and its population dynamics. Based on population models, for the 250 bird species regularly migrating across the German sea area an increase of the existing mortality rate by 0.5-5 % seems to be acceptable -any further loss of individuals has to be judged to be of considerable impact. Because the area covered by a bird population during migration usually spreads over several countries, impact in the German sea area cannot be assessed isolated from neighbouring regions. In contrast to resting and breeding birds (see above), an international approach is necessary for migrating birds. So far, evidence about the amount of collisions with marine wind farms is not available, making predictions about the adverse effects of such anthropogenic impact impossible.

Since reliable maps of the underwater nature are scarce, planners often have to work with inconsistent data. We compare the outcomes of three hypothetical planning schemes with dissimilar input benthic ecology datasets in order to define suitable sites for shallow water wind turbine placement. The study is conducted in the northern Baltic Sea where the brown algae bladderwrack (Fucus spp.) forms important submerged habitats that can be disturbed by wind turbine construction. We evaluated the effects of the input data using two different approaches. In the first, we placed a maximum number of wind turbines at four different depth classes. After choosing the locations, we examined the potential area of affected Fucus habitats. In the second approach, we tested the accumulation of damage to Fucus habitats when adding new turbines to the research area by starting from the furthest available location of known important Fucus sites. Both approaches indicated that using data from airborne LIDAR helps coastal planners avoid the risk of unnecessary destruction of benthic key habitats. LIDAR surveys can help to optimize the locations for the detailed planning of vast areas in a way that point-based inventories or statistical predictive modeling cannot achieve.

Our results demonstrate that during the construction and operation of the turbine the perceptions and views of different stakeholders sometimes disagreed but were often surprisingly similar in relation to both likelihood and intensity of the potential impacts of the turbine on marine biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being in general. The overall consensus of views was refined and evolved under an adaptive management approach over the 10 years of the discussions and decision-making processes.

In the North Sea alone, the decommissioning liability is estimated at 40 billion by 2040. Current international policy requires removal of offshore infrastructure when their production life ends; however, this policy is being questioned as emerging data reveal the importance of these structures to fish and invertebrate populations. Indeed, some governments are developing 'rigs-to-reef (RTR) policies in situations where offshore infrastructure is demonstrated to have important environmental benefits. Using Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), this study quantified and analysed fish and invertebrate assemblage dynamics associated with an oil and gas (O&G) complex in the Dogger Bank Special Area of Conservation (SAC), in the North Sea, Germany. We found clear depth zonation of organisms: infralittoral communities (0-15 m), circalittoral assemblages (15-45 m) and epibenthic communities (45-50 m), which implies that 'topping' or 'toppling' decommissioning strategies could eliminate communities that are unique to the upper zones. Sessile invertebrate assemblages were significantly different between structures, which appeared to be driven by both biotic and abiotic mechanisms. The O&G complex accommodated diverse and abundant motile invertebrate and fish assemblages within which the whelk BUCCilliLLITI undaturn, cod fish Gothic morhua and lumpsucker fish Cyclopterus lumpus used the infrastructure for different stages of reproduction. This observation of breeding implies that the structures may be producing more fish and invertebrates, as opposed to simply acting as sites of attraction (sensu the 'attraction vs production' debate). At present, there are no records of C. lumpus spawning at such depth and distance from the coast, and this is the first published evidence of this species using an offshore structure as a spawning site. Overall, this study provides important new insight into the role of offshore O&G structures as habitat for fish and invertebrates in the North Sea, thereby helping to inform decommissioning decisions.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,20,0,26,,,0141-1136,1879-0291,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Sci Consulting Ltd, Spott Rd, Dunbar EH42 1RR, East Lothian, ScotlandSouthampton Solent Univ, East Pk Terrace, Southampton SO14 0RD, Hants, EnglandUniv Hull, Ctr Environm & Marine Sci, Scarborough Campus,Filey Rd, Scarborough YO11 3AZ, N Yorkshire, EnglandDeakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Geelong, Vic 3216, Australia",Ocean Sci Consulting Ltd,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000452943500008,30274717,

In general, the strategy of nesting on man-made structures is uncommon both in Ukraine and Europe, and Cormorants do this only in the absence of other sites suitable for nesting. Special research on Cormorant colonies on technogenic constructions was carried out during the field expeditions by the Research Institute of Biodiversity of Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecosystems of Ukraine in 2002-2003 and 2012-2016. Besides this, we used retrospective and current data from the literature and Internet resources. Most of the field work was carried out by making surveys by boat and on foot. As a result, we found 8 Cormorant colonies on technogenic constructions in Ukraine: gas platforms in the Sea of Azov (near the village Strilkove, Henichesk district of Kherson region); sunken ships - targets for bombing training near the Arabat Spit (these are also known as ship islands); electricity pylons of the high-voltage Enerhodar Dnipro Power Line where it crosses the Kakhovka Reservoir; the dock in Yahorlyk Bayk, used in the past as a target for bombing training bombing; artificial island-platforms on Lake Chernine (Kinburn Peninsula); an artificial island on the Sasyk Lagoon (Odessa region); artificial islands, made as navigation markers on the Kremenchuk and Kiev reservoirs. The study found that in most cases the accompanying species was the Caspian Gull (Larus cachinnans Pallas, 1811), which actively destroys the Cormorants' nests and eats their eggs and chicks. The number of nests in the colonies varied greatly (5-30 nests on the navigation marker islands and ca. 2 000-2 300 on the ship-islands and gas platforms). This is due, primarily, to the area of the breeding territory. The research found that fierce territorial competition was observed in most of the colonies both with Caspian Gulls and between Cormorants. In addition, we observed anthropogenic interference in the colonies by fishermen and workers conducting routine maintenance work (as happened in the case of electricity pylons and gas platforms). The benefit of this study is that it is the first research in Ukraine conducted at national level on this type of nesting by Cormorants.

Nevertheless, this parameter may in fact have rather large implications as it controls such features as gravity waves and turbulence. In this paper, a closer look has been taken at the behavior of static stability in a 3 km gridded numerical downscaling of the ERA-Interim reanalysis. The simulation performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting model has been nudged towards large scale analysis (spectral nudging) and satellite-derived ocean surface winds (Quick Scatterometer). The validation of low-level static stability was conducted in the North Sea using data from the FINO1 mast for year 2008, and a deeper part of the atmosphere was validated using the Ekofisk oil platform radiosonde data for years 2007-2010. The offshore mast comparison shows that the model over-predicts the number of unstable cases and that the unstable cases are not unstable enough. The model simulated a clear dependency between vertical wind shear and static stability; however, this was not the case in the observations. The model produced too few events with weak turbulence, but rather put the emphasis on intermediate turbulent intensities. With the radiosonde data measuring the static stability over a deeper part of the atmosphere, similar results as for lower levels showed. In addition, the temperature gradient across the inversion at the boundary layer top was too shallow in the model, potentially letting too much wave energy escape the boundary layer.

Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were found in the liver and bile of both species, yet there was no correlation by sites. Our results demonstrate that C fulvoguttatus and P. maculatus have potential as indicator species for assessing the effects from exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons.

The system is based on 3D hydrodynamic, mesoscale resolving models providing forcing fields for a Lagrangian module of oil dispersion and slick evolution (oil transport and transformation). The tool provides,daily, the outputs of numerical simulations of possible oil spills from extraction platform sites. In this work we present the results for the 3 platforms closest to the Italian coast. Aside the operational usage, the numerical outputs are also stored and adopted to compute statistics of the slick distributions in the coastal and marine areas of interest. The hazard was assessed by means of two different indices (Hazard Index and Occurrence Index) based on the operational system outputs, for the estimation of the hazard at sea (marine hazard or aerial hazard). As short forecasts (2 days long) often do not allow the oil to reach the coast, an extra set of long-period simulations has been performed in order to compute a third Hazard Index (Coastal Hazard Index) suitable to estimate the hazard along the shorelines. The adoptedmethodology allowed, as a whole, to assess both coastal and marine oil spill hazard due to oil spill extraction activities.

Wind turbine noise was only measurable above ambient noise at frequencies below 500 Hz. Total sound pressure level was in the range 109-127 dB re 1 mu Pa rms, measured at distances between 14 and 20 m from the foundations. The 1/3-octave noise levels were compared with audiograms of harbor seals and harbor porpoises. Maximum 1/3-octave levels were in the range 106-126 dB re 1 mu Pa rms. Maximum range of audibility was estimated under two extreme assumptions on transmission loss (3 and 9 dB per doubling of distance, respectively). Audibility was low for harbor porpoises extending 20-70 m from the foundation, whereas audibility for harbor seals ranged from less than 100 m to several kilometers. Behavioral reactions of porpoises to the noise appear unlikely except if they are very close to the foundations. However, behavioral reactions from seals cannot be excluded up to distances of a few hundred meters. It is unlikely that the noise reaches dangerous levels at any distance from the turbines and the noise is considered incapable of masking acoustic communication by seals and porpoises.

Counts of seals by aerial transect showed a sharp decline in May, prior to pupping and the first ships arriving; counts rebounded by the end of June remaining high until August. Seal distribution and abundance peaked in 5-7 tenths ice cover; total area of ice cover showed no effect. Despite regular flushing of seals by ships, we found no broad-scale patterns in seal abundance and distribution that could be explained by ship presence. We cannot rule out mechanisms of long-term disturbance, difficult to detect and that might explain notable differences with other, similar sites.

The chapter concludes with a summary of commonly used habitat mapping technologies. Benthic (seafloor) habitats are physically distinct areas of seabed that are associated with particular species, communities, or assemblages that consistently occur together. Benthic habitat maps are spatial representations of physically distinct areas of seabed that are associated with particular groups of plants and animals. Habitat maps can illustrate the nature, distribution, and extent of distinct physical environments present and importantly they can predict the distribution of the associated species and communities.The data sets collected for constructing habitat maps provide fundamental information that can be used for a range of management and industry applications, including the management of fisheries, spatial marine environmental management, design of marine reserves, supporting offshore oil and gas infrastructure development, port and shipping channel construction, maintenance dredging, tourism, and seabed aggregate mining. Seafloor habitat mapping provides fundamental baseline information for decision-makers working in these sectors.GeoHab (www.geohab.org) is an international association of marine scientists conducting research using a range of mapping technologies into the use of biophysical (i.e., geologic and oceanographic) indicators of benthic habitats and ecosystems as proxies for biological communities and species diversity. Using this approach, combinations of physical attributes of the seabed identify habitats that have been demonstrated to be effective as surrogates for the benthic communities that they typically support. Thus management priorities can be identified using seabed habitat maps as a guide. The work of GeoHab demonstrates how knowledge of seabed properties can be employed to guide marine environmental management, marine resource management, and conservation efforts.Seafloor geomorphology is one of the more useful of the physical attributes of the seabed mapped and measured by GeoHab scientists. Different geomorphic features (e.g., submarine canyons, seamounts, atolls, fjords, etc.) are commonly associated with particular suites of habitats. Knowledge of the geomorphology and biogeography of the seafloor has improved markedly over the past 15 years. Using multibeam sonar, submarine features such as fjords, sand banks, coral reefs, seamounts, canyons, and spreading ridges have been revealed in unprecedented detail. The case studies presented in this book represent a range of seabed geomorphic features where detailed bathymetric maps have been combined with seabed video and sampling to yield an integrated picture of the benthic communities that are associated with different types of benthic habitat.",,,,,,,,,3,1,0,0,2,0,4,,,,,978-0-12-814961-4; 978-0-12-814960-7,,,,,,,,,"UNEP GRID Arendal, Arendal, NorwayUniv Sydney, Sch Geosci, UNEP GRID Arendal, Sydney, NSW, Australia",UNEP GRID Arendal,,,2020-12-31,WOS:000540371300003,,

Under induced conditions, some important changes in the subcellular structures related to astaxanthin accumulation were observable. For example, a large number of astaxanthin granules, oil structures and starch granules appeared in the thick-walled cells; Astaxanthin granules gradually dissolved into the oil structures and spread throughout the entire cell with the fusion and diffusion process of oil structures during the middle and late stages of induction; The plastoglobules were closed to the newly formed structures, and some plastoglobules would abnormally increase in size under stress. Based on observations of cell damage, the degradation of membrane structures, such as chloroplasts, was found to be the primary form of damage during the early stage of induction. During the middle stage of induction, some transparent holes were exposed in the dissolving astaxanthin granules in the cytoplasm. In thick-walled cells, these transparent holes were covered by oil substances dissolving astaxanthin, thereby avoiding further damage to cells. Given the relatively few oil structures, in non-thick-walled cells, the transparent holes expanded to form multiple transparent areas, eventually resulting in the rupture and death of cells. These results suggested that the high level of synthesis and the wide range diffusion of oil explained the expansion of astaxanthin in H. pluvialis.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,7,0,7,,,1226-2617,2093-0860,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China OUC, Key Lab Marine Genet & Breeding, Minist Educ, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China",Ocean Univ China OUC,,,2020-10-14,WOS:000574269300004,,

The tests were performed at the Danish Hydraulic Institute within the framework of the EU-Hydralab IV Integrated Infrastructure Initiative. The Froude-scaled model was subjected to regular and irregular waves, and to steady wind loads. Measurements were taken of hydrodynamics, displacements of the floating structure, wave induced forces at critical sections of the structure and at the mooring lines. First, free vibration tests were performed to obtain natural periods and damping ratios. Then, displacements, rotations, accelerations, and forces were measured under regular and irregular waves and three different wind conditions corresponding to cut-in, rated speed and cut-out. RAO, Statistical and spectral analyses were carried out to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the spar buoy wind turbine.The results show that most of the dynamic response occurs at the wave frequency, with minor contributions at the first and second harmonics of this, and at the natural rigid-body frequencies. In addition, in many cases a non-negligible contribution was found at the first bending frequency of the structure; this suggests that Cauchy scaling of the model cannot be neglected.According to the EU-Hydralab IV programme 'Rules and conditions' (www.hydralab.eu ), the raw data are public domain, and therefore they represent a unique dataset of measurements, possibly useful for further analyses, for calibration and validation of numerical models, and for comparison with full scale observations.

Generally, such structures remain in situ for long ti me after the end of drilling and production activities. The macrozoobenthic communities of a sea area located in the Northern Adriatic Sea surrounding one of these platforms were studied on two occasions: the first prior to the installation of the platform (1985) and the second 8 years later (1993), after production and other activities had terminated. On both occasions, samplings were performed according to similar sampling grids extending about 3.5 km from the platform site. Comparing the community composition of the two periods, a remarkable decrease of surface deposit feeders was observed in the second period. Ordering techniques, applied to the entire set of community;samples of both periods, pointed out not only the expected separation of the sampling points of the two periods but also a different pattern of dispersion. In fact, the samples of the first period were more dispersed in the model than those of the second period. The Bray-Curtis similarity values between samples exhibit a significantly greater similarity between pairs of samples of the second period, in spite of the fact that the diversity values of each individual sample are not different in the two sets, the different patterns of the increase of diversity, when plotted against the number of samples, further confirms the greater faunal uniformity among the samples of the second period. The results are discussed in tig ht of sedimentological studies, performed in the same area, which highlight the role of the submerged structure in increasing the hydrodynamic energy near the bottom. This is consistent with the more recent findings in the literature on the dynamic variables that control the infauna distribution.",,,,,1st National Congress of Marine Science1st National Congress of Marine Science,"NOV 11-14, 1998NOV 11-14, 1998",Consorzio Nazl Interuniv Sci MareConsorzio Nazl Interuniv Sci Mare,"ISL ISCHIA, ITALYISL ISCHIA, ITALY",3,0,0,0,3,0,3,,,,,88-470-0114-5,,,,,,,,,"Univ Modena, Dipartimento Biol Anim, I-41100 Modena, Italy",,,,2001-01-01,WOS:000167471400048,,

Yet there is a growing interest and dependence on the offshore wind climate from, for example, a wind energy perspective. Using idealized model experiments, we investigate the sea breeze circulation at scales which approximate to those of the southern North Sea, a region of major ongoing offshore wind farm development. We also contrast the scales and characteristics of the pure and the little known corkscrew and backdoor sea breeze types, where the type is pre-defined by the orientation of the synoptic scale flow relative to the shoreline. We find, crucially, that pure sea breezes, in contrast to corkscrew and backdoor types, can lead to substantial wind speed reductions offshore and that the addition of a second eastern coastline emphasises this effect through generation of offshore calm zones. The offshore extent of all sea breeze types is found to be sensitive to both the influence of Coriolis acceleration and to the boundary layer scheme selected. These extents range, for example for a pure sea breeze produced in a 2ms(-1) offshore gradient wind, from 0 km to 21 km between the Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino and the Yonsei State University schemes respectively. The corkscrew type restricts the development of a backdoor sea breeze on the opposite coast and is also capable of traversing a 100 km offshore domain even under high along-shore gradient wind speed (> 15ms(-1)) conditions. Realistic variations in sea surface skin temperature and initializing vertical thermodynamic profile do not significantly alter the resulting circulation, though the strengths of the simulated sea breezes are modulated if the effective land-sea thermal contrast is altered. We highlight how sea breeze impacts on circulation need to be considered in order to improve the accuracy of both assessments of the offshore wind energy climate and forecasts of wind energy output.",,,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,2,0,62,,,1680-7316,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, EnglandUniv E Anglia, Weatherquest Ltd, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",,,,2013-02-14,WOS:000313513700026,,

However, marine renewable energy devices are likely to have direct impacts and indirect effects on shelf and coastal environments and biota across a range of spatio-temporal scales. These potential effects (both positive and negative) have implications for pelagic, demersal and benthic fish and invertebrate (shellfish) populations, their essential habitats and the fisheries they support. Globally, there is at present a very limited understanding of how large-scale development of marine renewable energy installations (MREI) will affect fish and shellfish populations and the fisheries that exploit them.Whilst some research to date has considered fish sensory responses to probable noise and electromagnetic fields associated with MREIs, the major gaps in knowledge that will have particular socio-economic importance lie in understanding the longer term behavioural and ecological responses, including habitat use by fish and shellfish, arising from marine renewable devices themselves and the areas immediately surrounding areas that exclude fishing. Hence, there is a need to quantify whether fisheries in areas adjacent to fishery exclusion zones around MREI sites in temperate regions are enhanced by the hypothesised biological 'spillover' effect, how MREI areas may be connected biologically, and the biological and socio-economic effects of displacing exploitation pressure from MREI sites to adjacent areas.In the proposed research we will use a novel combination of behavioural tracking, density estimations and modelling approaches to address whether 'spillover' of species abundance (fish, shellfish) as a consequence of the no-fishing area around MREIs enhance adjacent areas. We propose to conduct research at a small-spatial scale, wave energy test site (the Wave Hub, off Hayle, Cornwall) and a Round 1 (R1) 30-turbine offshore wind farm (North Hoyle, off Rhyl, North Wales) and the area north of this towards the R2 Gwynt-y-Mor wind farm currently under construction. Our approach in these locations will be to quantify where large numbers of fish and shellfish of several species (e.g. edible crab, lobster, Atlantic cod, thornback ray) are located in relation to MREI, adjacent and more distant areas, and how much time they spend in those locations over annual cycles. We will then use this precise spatial information for several hundred individuals to scale up to potential population levels using relative abundance data from surveys for these focal species in those areas. From this, empirical estimates of the magnitude of spillover and its spatio-temporal dynamics will be made. These will be compared with spatial fishery models, to assess how rates of exchange of animals between areas accessible and inaccessible to fishing determine outcomes in terms of both spawning potential and fishery yield. We will use an individual-based modelling approach to identify how patterns of space use by fish/shellfish determine these outcomes when MREIs are introduced into stock areas. This research will also undertake a socio-economic analysis of the impacts and benefits to fisheries of MREIs that exclude fishing, and the effects of displacement of fishing exploitation to adjacent areas.These data will be contextualised with the relative abundance of predators of fish (seabirds, marine mammals) in MREI and adjacent areas together with how fish and shellfish movements and space use change in response to variations in the physical environment (wave height, current velocity) will allow a deeper understanding of the drivers of distributional change in target species in MREI and adjacent areas.

European energy initiatives recognize the importance of blue energy and encourage its research and development. The offshore exploitation of hydrocarbons worldwide is entering the final phase, followed by the gradual decommissioning of the production platforms and their removal. Decommissioning usually has an adverse effect on the environment aside from its economic intensity. By proper planning, lifetime of existing offshore infrastructure can be extended as it can be used for blue energy or other activities related to the blue economy. The paper deals with preliminary assessment of natural gas offshore infrastructure applicability for various blue energy options such as the wind power for electricity generation along with hydrogen, methane or ammonia production and other uses to reduce waste, energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Methods used included data gathering from 19 offshore gas facilities including assessment of natural gas production on current offshore fields, reserves and technology use, wind potential and decommissioning. Review of potential for energy production, storage and other activities such as CCS and CCU have also been given. Preliminary results show that there are possibilities for feasible and environmentally friendly blue energy utilisation. Average calculated capacity factors for the wind turbines are at the 32%.

The model accounts for cyclic degradation by using the cyclic strain accumulation procedure developed at NGI in the seventies. The load history is idealized by a load composition containing load parcels with constant average and cyclic loads in each parcel. The applicability of the procedure is verified by back calculating a model test of a gravity base structure (GBS) in soft clay subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading.

A spar-buoy wind turbine with a rigid tube about 300 m long is proposed as a pipe to drive deep water up to the surface. The minimum energy required to uplift the water is the potential energy difference between surface waters inside and outside the pipe, which depends on the background density profile. The corresponding surface jump or hydraulic head, h, calculated for several analytical and experimental density profiles, is of the order of 10 cm. If the complete turbine power (of the order of several MW) is used for raising the water (assuming a 100% pump efficiency), in a frictionless flow, very large water volumes, of the order of thousands of m(3) s(-1), will be transported to the photic layers. In a more realistic case, taking into account pipe friction in wide pipes, of the order of 10 m radius, and a power delivered to the fluid of 1 MW, the volume transport is still very large, about 500 m(3) s(-1). However, such a large amount of dense water could sink fast to aphotic layers due to vertical static instability (the fountain effect), ruining the enhancement of primary production. Hence, some ways to increase the turbulent entrainment and avoid the fountain effect are proposed. From the energetic viewpoint, artificial upwelling using offshore wind energy is a promising way to fertilize large open sea regions. This mariculture application is, however, severely subjected to atmosphere and ocean climatology, as well as to ecological dynamics. The general problem is multidisciplinary, and some important physical, engineering and ecological questions need to be seriously addressed to improve our confidence in the approach presented here.",,,,,32nd Scientific Meetings of the Mediterranean - Josep Miquel Vidal32nd Scientific Meetings of the Mediterranean - Josep Miquel Vidal,"OCT 05-07, 2016OCT 05-07, 2016",,SPAINSPAIN,6,0,0,0,4,0,6,,,0214-8358,1886-8134,,,,,,,,,,"CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Dept Phys Oceanog & Technol, P Maritim de la Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona, Spain",,,,2016-11-09,WOS:000385612500021,,

However, much of this resource resides in waters deeper than 60m where current fixed bottom wind turbine technology is no longer economically viable. As a result, many are looking to floating wind turbines as a means of harnessing this deepwater offshore wind resource. The preferred floating platform technology for this application, however, is currently up for debate. To begin the process of assessing the unique behavior of various platform concepts for floating wind turbines, 1/50th scale model tests in a wind/wave basin were performed at the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN) of three floating wind turbine concepts. The Froude scaled tests simulated the response of the 126m rotor diameter National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) 5 MW, horizontal axis Reference Wind Turbine attached via a flexible tower in turn to three distinct platforms, these being a tension leg-platform, a spar-buoy, and a semisubmersible. A large number of tests were performed ranging from simple free-decay tests to complex operating conditions with irregular sea states and dynamic winds. The high-quality wind environments, unique to these tests, were realized in the offshore basin via a novel wind machine, which exhibited low swirl and turbulence intensity in the flow field. Recorded data from the floating wind turbine models include rotor torque and position, tower top and base forces and moments, mooring line tensions, six-axis platform motions, and accelerations at key locations on the nacelle, tower, and platform. A comprehensive overview of the test program, including basic system identification results, is covered in previously published works. In this paper, the results of a comprehensive data analysis are presented, which illuminate the unique coupled system behavior of the three floating wind turbines subjected to combined wind and wave environments.

However, such sources of energy are not without drawbacks, given that their installation, operation and decommissioning may potentially cause damage to and threaten the marine environment. It is therefore important to achieve a balance between the environmental benefits of using of the oceans and the need for protection of the environment.Scientific uncertainty and lack of initial data on the potential effects of these facilities, have led to long delays in processing Environmental Impact Assessments, and public opposition to these projects has contributed to stagnation in terms of its development in Spain. Furthermore, incomplete environmental impact studies and inappropriate environmental impact statements (such as those that fail to assess the synergistic effects of nearby facilities and all components thereof) can lead to delays in processing applications, the inadmissibility of wind projects, and ineffective protection of the marine environment.The current regulations on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)-along with case-law decisions-, are an attempt to solve several of these varied problems and clashes of interests between promoters, citizens, and administrators, while protecting biodiversity and fighting climate change. However, some regulatory gaps and legal uncertainties still require regulatory improvement in this respect.The main objective of this research is therefore to assess the real and potential future legal and factual problems in the field of environmental assessment associated with offshore wind farms in Spain, in an analysis of the responses and solutions provided by the Directive 2014/52/EU and the 21/2013 Environmental Assessment Law. Regulatory improvements are proposed, which could help to boost the development of marine renewable energy facilities, promoting greater public consensus, while at the same time protecting biodiversity and the marine environment.The main proposed improvements consist of establishing a joint or coordinated processing of ETA with other assessments and procedures (such as the evaluations derived from birds and habitats directives); elaborating guidance documents which help promoters in analyzing synergistic and cumulative effects in their Environmental Impact Studies, hereafter EIS; enhancing the role of the scoping phase and, specially, considering the inclusion of this stage in the regulation of the simplified EIA procedure; improving public information and participation in the EIA process through the establishment of the obligation of disseminate relevant information through electronic means, the expansion of the legal concept of interested persons and the inclusion of public participation phases both in early stages of the procedure and after substantial modifications of the project or the study of EIA.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,0,13,,,0964-5691,1873-524X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Vigo, Environm Phys Lab, Campus As Lagoas S-N, Orense 32004, SpainUniv A Coruna, Observ Litoral, La Coruna, Spain",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000437057200018,,

We combined a Bayesian Belief Network with a Geographical Information System (GIS) for the spatially explicit quantification of the ecological and economic risks of spatial management options. As an example we assessed the German exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the North Sea to determine the potential effects of 2 scenarios on the vulnerability of plaice Pleuronectes platessa to fishing, fishing fleets and their revenues. In the first scenario we simulated a shift in plaice distribution due to changes in bottom temperatures to assess spatial management options. Then we imitated an expansion of offshore wind energy development with an associated reallocation of international fishing effort to assess the ecological and economic consequences. We predicted that an increase of 0.5 degrees C in the average bottom temperature would require a significant reduction in fishing effort to maintain the current relative level of the vulnerability of plaice to fishing. The likely consequences of the second scenario were a homogenous increase in plaice catches around the areas closed for fishing, together with a decrease in the vulnerability of plaice to fishing within 17% of the study area. Our results showed the great potential of this framework to integrate the spatially explicit assessment of the economic and ecological risks of spatial management options.

As the electric currents in submarine cables induce electromagnetic fields there is a concern of how they may influence fishes. Studies have shown that there are fish species that are magneto-sensitive using geomagnetic field information for the purpose of orientation. Thin implies that if the geomagnetic field is locally altered it could influence spatial patterns in fish. There are also physiological aspects to consider, especially for species that are less inclined to move as the exposure could be persistent in a particular area. Even though studies have shown that magnetic fields could affect fish, there is at present limited evidence that fish are influenced by the electromagnetic fields that underwater cables from wind-mills generate. Studies on European eel in the Baltic Sea have indicated some minor effects. In this article we give an overview on the type of submarine cables that are used for electric transmissions in the sea.

However, it is not clear to developers and management departments which types of sea areas can be used for offshore wind projects. According to the provincial marine functional zoning (MFZ), China's coastal provinces have put offshore wind zoning (OWZ) into practice. This paper clarifies the method of OWZ, collects the results from offshore wind zones (OWZs) of 10 coastal provinces, and assesses the characteristics of OWZs by area, functional attribute and distance from the coastline. The results show that most of the areas available for offshore wind are co-existence zones where offshore wind can be sited in an agricultural and fisheries zone, an industrial and urban construction zone, a special-use zone, etc. Currently, 47% of existing offshore wind projects have been located in the OWZs in the East China Sea. Moreover, parts of the coastline distance of OWZs do not meet the double-ten principle in China or global siting trends. Generally, the existing areas for OWZ would allow China to meet its national target by 2020, but measures still need to be taken to meet the demands of conservation and sea-use management.

Understanding the abundance, distribution and habitat use of species is fundamental for conservation and the implementation of management. Bottlenose dolphin and harbour porpoise usage of feeding sites within Cardigan Bay SAC was examined using passive acoustic monitoring. Acoustic detections recorded with calibrated T-PODs (acoustic data loggers) indicated harbour porpoise to be present year round and in greater relative abundance than bottlenose dolphin. Fine-scale temporal partitioning between the species occurred at three levels: (1) seasonal differences, consistent between years, with porpoise detections peaking in winter months and dolphin detections in summer months; (2) diel variation, consistent across sites, seasons and years, with porpoise detections highest at night and dolphin detections highest shortly after sunrise; and (3) tidal variation was observed with peak dolphin detections occurring during ebb at the middle of the tidal cycle and before low tide, whereas harbour porpoise detections were highest at slack water, during and after high water with a secondary peak recorded during and after low water. General Additive Models (GAMs) were applied to better understand the effects of each covariate. The reported abundance and distribution of the two species, along with the temporal variation observed, have implications for the design and management of protected areas.

Developmental toxicity of extractable organic compounds in produced water effluents from oil and gas/condensate production platforms in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea was assessed in a temporal and spatial manner using zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Large-scale solid-phase extraction (SPE) and on-column fractionation of water-soluble fraction (WSF) and an oil/particulate fraction was used in a rapid screening bioassay for embryotoxicity. Exposure to produced water extracts increased rate of mortality and reduced pigmentation and heart rate, as well as delaying time to hatch. The oil/particulate fraction was 10-fold less toxic than WSF, indicating that toxicity was predominantly produced by moderately polar and bioavailable compounds. Large spatial and temporal variation in produced water toxicity was observed, displaying considerable variability in the reservoir, oil well, and effluent composition over time. The noted toxicity did not correlate well with either reported produced water composition or parameters such as total hydrocarbons, thus challenging chemical measurements as a reliable source of information for predicting complex effects.

Magnomatics Pseudo Direct Drive (PDD(r)) combines a magnetic gear with a permanent magnet generator. The PDD is very efficient and very reliable with no meshing gear teeth. Independent analysis has shown this provides lower cost of energy.The novel component in this technology is a pole piece rotor (PPR), a cylindrical structure comprising multiple axial steel pole pieces within a non-magnetic composite structure. In operation these pole pieces are subject to massive forces and complex cyclical loads. In previous demonstration units the construction methods used in the PPR were expensive and labour intensive. There are now several alternative concept designs for scaling up the technology but building and testing these at full scale would be very expensive. The PPR for a 15MW generator will be approximately 9m diameter. In this project new instrumentation will be installed in the 500kW CHEG generator and then extensively dynamometer tested to better understand the behaviour of the PPR under wind turbine loads and cycles. The testing carried out at the ORE Catapult will capitalize on previous testing carried out there during the Demo Wind project.Magnomatics will then develop sophisticated computer-based modelling software which can then be used to design robust PPRs including dynamic modelling of the pole piece loads to predict wear and possible erosion of the composite structure. These methods will be validated using the new test data from the ORE Catapult. A virtual product validation will be performed on concept designs. ensuring the PPR achieves the expected product lifetime of 25+ years. Wind turbine generator unit volumes could reach 800 units per annum therefore it would be essential to manufacture the PPR cost effectively. The AMRC, Sheffield, are providing input and support to Design for Manufacture of the PPR to achieve this.Proving this technology provides a credible route to UK construction of direct drive generators for offshore wind leading to annual sales of £1.2bn and dramatically increasing the proportion of UK content in offshore wind farms. This aligns perfectly with UK Industrial Strategy for PEMD and the Offshore Wind Sector deal. The technology can also apply to rail, marine propulsion and industrial drives, improving efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,79839,,,,,,,,Magnomatics Limited,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15296134,,

One such energy resource is fossil oil extracted from the seabed at offshore oil platforms. This type of oil production causes continuous environmental pollution from drilling waste, discharge of large amounts of produced water, and accidental spills.Methods and principal findings: Samples from natural populations of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in two North Sea areas with extensive oil production were investigated. Exposure to and uptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were demonstrated, and biomarker analyses revealed adverse biological effects, including induction of biotransformation enzymes, oxidative stress, altered fatty acid composition, and genotoxicity. Genotoxicity was reflected by a hepatic DNA adduct pattern typical for exposure to a mixture of PAHs. Control material was collected from a North Sea area without oil production and from remote Icelandic waters. The difference between the two control areas indicates significant background pollution in the North Sea.Conclusion: It is most remarkable to obtain biomarker responses in natural fish populations in the open sea that are similar to the biomarker responses in fish from highly polluted areas close to a point source.

The results demonstrate the unique advantages and disadvantages of each floating wind turbine platform.",,,,,"31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUL 01-06, 2012JUL 01-06, 2012","Petrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivPetrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL",4,1,0,0,0,0,4,,,,,978-0-7918-4494-6,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maine, Orono, ME USA",,,,2013-11-05,WOS:000324507000053,,

In this study, we investigate the characteristics of depression and elevation ISWs based on comparisons between observational results and internal wave theories. It is suggested that the large amplitude depression wave is better represented by the extended Korteweg-de Vries (EKdV) theory than by the KdV model, whereas the large amplitude elevation wave is in better agreement with the KdV equation than with the EKdV theory. Wave-induced forces on a supposed small-diameter cylindrical pile by depression and elevation waves are also estimated using the internal wave theory and Morison formula. The wave-induced force by elevation ISWs is rarely reported in the literature. It is found that the force induced by the elevation wave differs significantly from that by the depression wave, and the elevation wave generally produces greater force on the pile in the lower water column than the depression wave. These results show that ISWs in the study area can present a serious threat to ocean engineering structures, and should not be ignored in the design of oil platforms and ocean operations.",,,,,,,,,16,9,0,0,2,0,23,,,0254-4059,1993-5005,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves KLOCAW, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Nantong Branch, Nantong 226000, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China",,,,2012-07-25,WOS:000305906700024,,

However, marine renewable energy devices are likely to have direct impacts and indirect effects on shelf and coastal environments and biota across a range of spatio-temporal scales. These potential effects (both positive and negative) have implications for pelagic, demersal and benthic fish and invertebrate (shellfish) populations, their essential habitats and the fisheries they support. Globally, there is at present a very limited understanding of how large-scale development of marine renewable energy installations (MREI) will affect fish and shellfish populations and the fisheries that exploit them.Whilst some research to date has considered fish sensory responses to probable noise and electromagnetic fields associated with MREIs, the major gaps in knowledge that will have particular socio-economic importance lie in understanding the longer term behavioural and ecological responses, including habitat use by fish and shellfish, arising from marine renewable devices themselves and the areas immediately surrounding areas that exclude fishing. Hence, there is a need to quantify whether fisheries in areas adjacent to fishery exclusion zones around MREI sites in temperate regions are enhanced by the hypothesised biological 'spillover' effect, how MREI areas may be connected biologically, and the biological and socio-economic effects of displacing exploitation pressure from MREI sites to adjacent areas.In the proposed research we will use a novel combination of behavioural tracking, density estimations and modelling approaches to address whether 'spillover' of species abundance (fish, shellfish) as a consequence of the no-fishing area around MREIs enhance adjacent areas. We propose to conduct research at a small-spatial scale, wave energy test site (the Wave Hub, off Hayle, Cornwall) and a Round 1 (R1) 30-turbine offshore wind farm (North Hoyle, off Rhyl, North Wales) and the area north of this towards the R2 Gwynt-y-Mor wind farm currently under construction. Our approach in these locations will be to quantify where large numbers of fish and shellfish of several species (e.g. edible crab, lobster, Atlantic cod, thornback ray) are located in relation to MREI, adjacent and more distant areas, and how much time they spend in those locations over annual cycles. We will then use this precise spatial information for several hundred individuals to scale up to potential population levels using relative abundance data from surveys for these focal species in those areas. From this, empirical estimates of the magnitude of spillover and its spatio-temporal dynamics will be made. These will be compared with spatial fishery models, to assess how rates of exchange of animals between areas accessible and inaccessible to fishing determine outcomes in terms of both spawning potential and fishery yield. We will use an individual-based modelling approach to identify how patterns of space use by fish/shellfish determine these outcomes when MREIs are introduced into stock areas. This research will also undertake a socio-economic analysis of the impacts and benefits to fisheries of MREIs that exclude fishing, and the effects of displacement of fishing exploitation to adjacent areas.These data will be contextualised with the relative abundance of predators of fish (seabirds, marine mammals) in MREI and adjacent areas together with how fish and shellfish movements and space use change in response to variations in the physical environment (wave height, current velocity) will allow a deeper understanding of the drivers of distributional change in target species in MREI and adjacent areas.

This paper discusses three important aspects of the nonlinear dynamic time history analysis commonly used to design for Abnormal Level Earthquakes (ALE) in light of findings from recent centrifuge modeling and numerical simulation of the response of offshore structures under earthquake excitations. First, greater-than expected ground motion de-amplification has been observed in a recent seismic soil-structure interaction centrifuge program for typical soft marine clays with undrained shear strength up to 100 kPa per API RP 2GEO [3]. Second, the current industry practice of using uniform down-pile ground motions in the time history analysis tends to underestimate pile bending moments. Use of depth-varying ground motions is strongly recommended to better characterize pile bending moments. Alternatively, a simplified design approach is proposed to account for the higher bending moments from the use of more realistic depth varying ground motions. This approach is illustrated with a design example. Lastly, hysteretic and radiation damping in soil-structure interaction is discussed. Modeling of hysteretic damping is achieved using nonlinear elasto-plastic soil springs with unload-reload behavior following Masing's rule, whereas modeling of radiation damping is achieved using viscous dashpots in a parallel or series arrangement with the axial and lateral soil springs and with dashpot coefficients based on O'Rourke and Dobry [4]. The centrifuge data show that proper modeling of radiation damping is important to accurately predict pile load and settlement.",,,,,"35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2016JUN 19-24, 2016","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4992-7,,,,,,,,,"Energo Engn, Houston, TX 77002 USABP, Aberdeen, ScotlandBP, Houston, TX USA",Energo Engn,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000393090000062,,

To counteract this situation, a model of analysis of maxims loads has been elaborated taken place the extreme winds in wind turbines of great behavior. This model has the advantage of determining, in a chosen place, for the installation of a wind farm, the micro-areas with higher risk of wind loads above the acceptable for the standard classes of wind turbines.","La utilización de la energía eólica mediante los aerogeneradores en zonas de alto riesgo de ocurrencia de Huracanes viene siendo un reto importante para los diseñadores de parques eólicos a nivel mundial desde hace algunos años.

Para contrarrestar esto se ha elaborado un modelo de análisis de cargas máximas producidas por los vientos extremos en aerogeneradores. Este modelo tiene la ventaja de determinar en un sitio escogido para la instalación en un parque eólico las micro-zonas con mayor riesgo de presentar cargas de vientos por encima de las admisibles por las clases estándares de aerogeneradores.

This article firstly provides an account of recent developments in how offshore wind governance functions in some of the most important offshore wind-using nations. Secondly, the discussion of the EU's role in shaping offshore wind governance will inform future debates about the proper role of the EU in enabling investment in these megaprojects. Thirdly, the fact that policy appears to be converging raises questions about how policy is transmitted between EU member states, the answers to which could be valuable to policy makers looking at other areas of energy governance.

Although deep water floating wind turbines are being developed, most offshore wind farms still utilize traditional fixed-bottom foundation technologies [1]. The different types of foundation include monopile, gravity based, tripod, suction bucket and conventional steel jacket structures. Of these, monopile foundations have been the preferred foundation type so far, simply because they have an edge over other foundation types in shallow water, with regards to construction, production, assembly and cost efficiency. Over the years, there are numerous papers written on the subject of scour behavior for monopile foundations as well as a number of text books on scour at the seabed [2],[3],[4]. The effect of scour or erosion of sediment near a structure can potentially be detrimental to the stability of the structure and its fatigue life. On the other side of the coin, equally detrimental, is the effect of sediment build-up at openings and intake structures of hydroelectric power stations. Any impact or shutdown can cause losses of thousands of dollars in revenue per day as well as additional costs for manpower and repairs costs to damaged equipment when suspended sediment that is not removed, blocks and chokes valves and turbines.The core point of monitoring sediment build-up or scour is to understand the problem and carry out intervention work before it becomes unsolvable or the damage costs become multiple times more. In general, the two approaches to the design of rock protection around a monopile structure comprises either a static design or dynamic design, both of which would require monitoring of the natural variations in the level of the seabed due to movement of sand waves, sandbanks and general bed movement.Even when scour protections are applied around monopiles (as in the case of Horns Rev I Offshore Wind Farm in Denmark), it would be prudent to monitor the changes in entire scour protections as wave dominated sea conditions can be unpredictable and irregular. Even in less hostile environments such as bridge piers and docks where accessibility is not a problem, the water around these structures can often be turbulent and murky with very low or zero visibility. The traditional way of using commercial divers for inspection suffers from considerable limitations due to poor visibility and high risks to diver safety in high current and turbulent waters. Underwater inspections are often not possible during the flood events due to high volume and high flow rate of silty flood water as in the case of Bonnybrook Bridge in Calgary, Canada [5]As sonar technologies improve, interest in applying these tools for underwater inspection is increasing. A series of field tests and trial inspections both in the US and UK have been carried out using sonar and laser technology with favorable results. International Civil Engineers UK, (ICE) proceedings [6] and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), USA [7] described in great detail on the findings of using sonars for purposes of underwater inspections.The K-Observer Cloud system is a fully autonomous siltation build-up or scour monitoring system that uses permanently deployed sonars on site to provide 3D point cloud data and analysis reports of current and historic time series bathymetric data to the client in the office. The client can receive automated change detection analysis with alerts such as emails or sms for identification of changes which may exceed any threshold changes considered safe or allowable. The sonar is deployed at one location and creates a 3D map of the survey area in both horizontal and vertical planes. The rugged design of the dual axis scanning sonars, providing 3D point cloud, is ideal for long-term deployment in harsh environments. With no exposed moving parts, the transducer and rotator are contained within an adiprene, oil filled dome which inherently protects both transducer and rotator from possible damage from impacts of moving objects in the water column. Since the sonar is deployed permanently, it can capture critical changes especially in dynamic conditions which can easily be missed when conducting surveys periodically. Critical parameters of the surrounding riverbed at the intake will be scanned, at pre-defined and variable time intervals. This allows for a timely action/intervention for necessary remediation work. Together with a cloud based solution called 'Mapping Cloud' for storage, all work is done through a web browser. The physical instrumentation in the office is a small pc connected to the Internet. From the pc, datafiles are uploaded to the Mapping Cloud, with secure storage, backup and accessibility to the customer only. The real-time data can be shared between multiple users at different locations, with the owner's security and permission.Combining sonar technology with the management and dissemination of data via a cloud solution, this paper describes an autonomous system for real time monitoring of scour or sedimentation build-up using sonars deployed on site with capability of sending data, analysis reports and automated change detections alerts to users in the office.",,,,,IEEE Underwater Technology (UT) ConferenceIEEE Underwater Technology (UT) Conference,"APR 16-19, 2019APR 16-19, 2019","IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc Japan Chapter; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc Taipei Chapter; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc Taiwan Chapter; Taiwan Ocean Res Inst, Natl Appl Res LabsIEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc Japan Chapter; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc Taipei Chapter; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc Taiwan Chapter; Taiwan Ocean Res Inst, Natl Appl Res Labs","Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Kaohsiung, TAIWANNatl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Kaohsiung, TAIWAN",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2573-3788,2573-3796,978-1-5386-4188-0,,,,,,,,,"Kongsberg Mesotech Ltd, Marine Civil Engn, Port Coquitlam, BC, Canada",Kongsberg Mesotech Ltd,,,2019-11-04,WOS:000492031100041,,

The traditional method for assessment of the wind resource for wind energy application is through analysis of wind speed and wind direction observed during one or more years at a meteorological mast equipped with well-calibrated anemometers at several levels. The cost of such measurements is very high and therefore they are only sparsely available. An alternative method is the application of satellite remote sensing. Comparison of wind resource statistics from satellite products is presented and discussed including the uncertainty on the wind resource. The diurnal wind variability is found to be negligible at some location but up to 0.5 m s(-1) at two sites. Synergetic use of observations from multiple satellites in different orbits provides wind observations at six times in the diurnal cycle and increases the number of observations. At Horns Rev M2, FINO1 and Greater Gabbard satellite and in situ collocated samples show differences in mean wind speed of -2%, -1% and 3%, respectively. At Egmond aan Zee the difference is 10%. It is most likely due to scatterometer data sampled further offshore than at the meteorological mast. Comparing energy density with all samples at Horns Rev M2 shows overestimation 7-19% and at FINO1 underestimation 2-5% but no clear conclusion can be drawn as the comparison data are not collocated. At eight new offshore wind farm areas in Denmark, the variability in mean energy density observed by SAR ranges from 347 W m(-2) in Sejerobugten to 514 W m(-2) at Horns Rev 3. The spatial variability in the near-shore areas is much higher than at areas located further offshore. (C) 2014 DTU Wind Energy.

The mean distance between daughter polyps along a growth axis (27.4 +/- 5 mm, SD) was equivalent to the estimated annual growth rate; hence, the polyps bud once a year. The majority of growth occurred in the first year when the characteristic trumpet shape of a corallite was formed, while the thecal wall thickened more consistently.

J,,,,,,,,,,,EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Wind and Marine Energy Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 31 2014,2014,"This proposal is to establish a DTC in Wind and Marine Energy Systems. It brings together the UK's leading institutions in Wind Energy, the University of Strathclyde, and Marine Energy, the University of Edinburgh. The wider aim, drawing on existing links to the European Research Community, is to maintain a growing research capability, with the DTC at is core, that is internationally leading in wind and marine energy and on a par with the leading centres in Denmark, the USA, Germany and the Netherlands. To meet the interdisciplinary research demands of this sector requires a critical mass of staff and early stage researchers, of the sort that this proposal would deliver, to be brought together with all the relevant skills.Between the two institutions, academic staff have in-depth expertise covering the wind and wave resource, aerodynamics and hydrodynamics, design of wind turbines and marine energy devices, wind farms, fixed and floating structures, wind turbine, wind farm and marine energy devices control, power conversion, condition monitoring, asset management, grid-integration issues and economics of renewable energy. A centre of learning and research with strong links to the Wind and Marine Energy industry will be created that will provide a stimulating environment for the PhD students. In the first year of a four year programme, a broad intensive training will be provided to the students in all aspects of Wind and Marine Energy together with professional engineer training in research, communication, business and entrepreneurial skills. The latter will extend throughout the four years of the programme. Research will be undertaken in all aspects of Wind and Marine Energy.A DTC in Wind and Marine Energy Systems is vital to the UK energy sector for a number of reasons. The UK electricity supply industry is currently undergoing a challenging transition driven by the need to meet the Government's binding European targets to provide 15% of the UK's total primary energy consumption from renewable energy sources by 2020. Given that a limited proportion of transport and heating energy will come from such sources, it is expected that electricity supply will make the major contribution to this target. As a consequence, 40% or more of electricity will have to be generated from non-thermal sources. It is predicted that the UK market for both onshore and offshore wind energy is set to grow to £20 billion by 2015.There is a widely recognised skills gap in renewable energy that could limit this projected growth in the UK and elsewhere unless the universities dramatically increase the scale of their activities in this area.At the University of Strathclyde, the students will initially be housed in the bespoke accommodation in the Royal College Building allocated and refurbished for the existing DTC in Wind and Marine Energy Systems then subsequently in the Technology and Innovation Centre Building when it is completed. At the University of Edinburgh, the students will be housed in the bespoke accommodation in the Kings Buildings allocated and refurbished for the existing IDC in Offshore Renewable Energy. The students will have access to the most advanced design, analysis and simulation software tools available, including the industry standard wind turbine and wind farm design tools and a wide range of power system and computation modelling packages.Existing very strong links to industry of the academic team will be utilised to provide strategic guidance to the proposed DTC in Wind and Marine Energy through company membership of its Industrial Advisory Board and participation in 8 week 7 projects as part of the training year and in 3 year PhD projects. In addition, to providing suggestions for projects and engaging in the selection process, the Industry Partners provide support in the form of data, specialist software, access to test-rigs and advice and guidance to the students.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/L016680/1,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15396197,,

Anthropogenic activity has long impacted the marine continental shelf down to a depth of approximately -200 m. New activities are now affecting this coastal space such as renewable energies, recreational uses and aquaculture in addition to the traditional ones of navigation or fishing. This evolution raises new sources of conflict amongst users which can require state involvement in order to manage the different stakeholders and pressure groups. However, the coastal space still offers a large potential for development for two reasons. Firstly, the physical three dimensional potential of this space enables the whole water column to be used, principally to increase the fishing productivity as in Japan. Secondly, innovative synergies can be created between socio-technical and ecological uses (a fourth dimension) such as the eco-design of wind turbine foundations in order to create fish habitat or sea grass settlement. This new vision in 4D for the design and the management of coastal infrastructure can potentially reduce the risk of conflict as different uses of the coastal space would not necessarily exclude one another. Indeed, several forms of synergy could be developed such as fisheries with aquaculture or biological sustainability with social acceptability. Until now, limited attempts at such an approach have been done. We suggest this is likely due to the absence of a common eco-engineering vision and the lack of experience amongst biologists and engineers in the co-construction of projects. This eco-engineering, or green vision, also takes into account the complexity and resilience of the ecosystem in the long term, if underwater engineered infrastructures are also eco-designed to increase ecological gain This new conception, for development within the coastal area, provides for an increased bio-oriented complexity to engineered structure and therefore a better resistance of the ecosystem in the long term to anthropogenic pressures and a reduction in multi-user conflicts.",,,,,,,,,39,2,0,0,18,0,42,,,0990-7440,1765-2952,,,,,,,,,,"IFREMER, DS, F-34203 Sete, FranceEgis Eau, F-34965 Montpellier 2, FranceUniv Montpellier 3, UMR CEFE 5175, Dep Biol Ecol Environm, F-34199 Montpellier 5, France",,,,2011-04-01,WOS:000293593900005,,

The results demonstrate that while favourable low correlation values and long-time lags exist off the Northwest coast, there is high inter-annual variability. The East coast displays low variability of correlations and lags inter-annually with little complementary behaviour between the two resources or scope for co-location. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Bat fatalities can be reduced by altering turbine operations, but such curtailment decreases turbine efficiency. If additional ways of reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines were available such tradeoffs might not be needed. Based on the facts that bats perceive distant objects primarily through vision and can see in very dim lighting conditions, and the possibility that bats might interact with turbines after approaching them as they would trees, we propose a novel method of reducing bat activity at wind turbines: illumination of the structure with dim light. As a first step toward assessing this approach, we illuminated trees with dim flickering ultraviolet (UV) light in areas frequented by Hawaiian hoary bats Lasiurus cinereus semotus, an endangered subspecies affected by wind turbines. We used a repeated-measures design to quantify bat activity near trees with acoustic detectors and thermal video cameras in the presence and absence of UV illumination, while concurrently monitoring insect numbers. Results indicate that dim UV reduces bat activity despite an increase in insect numbers. Experimental treatment did not completely inhibit bat activity near trees, nor did all measures of bat activity show statistically significant differences due to high variance in bat activity among sites. However, the observed decreases in bat activity with dim UV illumination justify further testing of this method as a means to reduce bat fatalities at wind turbines.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,0,9,,,1863-5407,1613-4796,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Cooperat Studies Unit, Hilo, HI 96720 USAUSGS, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USABat Res & Consulting, Tucson, AZ 85745 USAUSGS, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, Hawaii Natl Pk, HI 96718 USA",Bat Res & Consulting,,,2015-11-11,WOS:000363405400005,,

Thus was born the Equator Principles to urge financial institutions to implement environmental responsibility, financial institutions' environmental responsibility has also been generally concerned about around the world. This article analyzes the theoretical basis and legal nature of the Equator Principles, the compact of the Equator Principles on financial institutions' environmental responsibility, the differences of China's current green credit and the Equator Principles from a legal point of view, proposing Chinese financial institutions' specific strategies to accept the constraints of the Equator Principles.The equator principles (The Equator Principles, referred to as EPs), by the International Finance Corporation and the Bank of Holland in 2002 held in London in October of the international commercial bank meeting proposed a business loan guidelines. From the Equator Principle Content perspective, it emphasizes the financial institutions lending review before a liability, the assessment of the proposed lending programs on environmental and social impact assessment of possible, to unqualified project loans. From the equator principles of nature, it is not the official general binding principles, but unofficial voluntary principle, in the international financial environment and social policy in the background, from the world's major financial institutions to develop, and used to assess the financing process may exist in the social and environmental risk.Corporate social responsibility is the equator principles emerge as the times require the most critical factor. Financial institutions is one of the main business loans, business or project to provide financing services, when project financing potential or substantive environmental risk and social issues, project financing activity results will give financial institutions cause tremendous negative impact. The government, the public and environmentalists would put the environmental risk and social problems of the blame for financial institutions to provide financing services prior to the audit is not strict, requiring financial institutions to assume more social responsibility, strengthen the financial services oversight, avoid risk and social problems. It is in this background, in 2002 October, project financing environment and social problem seminar is held in London, after drafting a set of project financing of environmental risk and social problems of the guide to action, namely the equator principles. In 2003 June, including Citigroup, Bank of Holland, Deutsche Bank, Barclays Bank, four initiated ten banks announced its acceptance of the equator principles. In 2006 July, the equator principles were first modification.The equator principles in the international society is one of the typical cases -practice Sakhalin No. 2 oil and gas projects. in today's society has produced important influence. Located in the Far East of Russia's Sahalim Sahalim on the island of 2 oil gas project is the world's largest integrated oil and gas projects, the project total construction including oil drilling platform, natural gas exploitation platform, oil refining factory, 800 kilometers of pipeline etc. The project triggered by environmental groups concerns mainly lies in the oil exploitation platform located in the one and only endangered whale predation from the sea of Okhotsk Sea near Sahalim, fear 2 project will damage the Western gray whale numbers. The local indigenous people also worry that Sahalim 2 will undermine the survival of their environment, particularly on fishery resources and the threat to the endangered wild animal habitat destruction. At the same time the laying of the pipeline through a plurality of seismic belt and the river, which also cause environmental concerns. So the project construction initial stage by non-governmental organizations to protest strongly, and the final resort to the law. In the face of pressure from all sides, the project had to be on the environmental impact review, commissioned by the world alliance of independent assessment of project environment influence on Western gray whale. Finally, environmentalists started pointing the finger of blame for the project to provide financing services of the bank, and the financing of the project including the bank JP Morgan Chase Bank, the European bank for reconstruction and development, the Bank of Holland, Credit Suisse, Mizuho Corporate Bank and several equator banks, environmentalists criticized the bank violates the equator principles provide loans for the project and financing services. The Russian government had to stop completed 80% of 2 Sahalim road project. Then, European bank announced that it would no longer provide financing for Sahalim 2 project, a number of the banks and financial institutions have also announced its withdrawal from the project. Because the Sahalim 2 oil and gas projects negative impact on the environment and the equator banks claimed the idea of environmental protection does not match, by environmental groups and the pressure of public opinion, many financial institutions to stop Sahalim 2 project financing. The equator principles although do not have the force of law, but as a kind of industry practices and the concept of environmental protection, to financial institutions and image of the impact is bigger, forcing financial institutions in making financing decisions, have to carefully consider the environmental risk.Sakhalin No. 2 oil and gas projects. occurrence caused the theory circle and practice circle pay close attention to generally, the article from the angle of law on the case put forward the following opinions:",,,,,"International Conference on Economic, Business Management and Education Innovation (EBMEI)International Conference on Economic, Business Management and Education Innovation (EBMEI)","MAY 22-23, 2013MAY 22-23, 2013",,"Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing, PEOPLES R CHINA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,,,,,,,,,"Lanzhou Univ, Sch Law, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",,,,2014-06-04,WOS:000335444300011,,

Amount of oil spills entering marine environment decreases gradually, but oil slicks are still significant danger for marine animals, also for birds. Oil spills have resulted in the death of a large number of seabirds (Table I), which are very sensitive to both internal and external affects of crude oil and its refined products. The overall result of efforts to rehabilitate oiled birds is poor.In many countries the extent of chronic oil pollution along a given shoreline is assessed by conducting systematic beached bird surveys, and determining the number and percentage of birds found that are oiled. The percentage of found oiled birds is considered to indicate the risk to birds of becoming oiled at sea, and thus to represent between-year fluctuations in the amount of oil spilled in marine environment. Moreover, species structure of oiled birds indicates the zone in which oil was spilled. Occurrence of seaducks or auks among victims of oil pollution suggests that spill entered sea waters far from the coastline, where these species are more abundant. On the other hand, dominance of swans, dabbling ducks and coots with absence of seaducks and auks indicates that source of pollution was localised close to the shoreline.Researches conducted along the Polish coast showed, that the amount of oil in marine waters of Polish Baltic zone was much lower that 30 years ago (Fig. 1).",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0013-2969,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Gdansk, Katedry Ekol and Zool Kregowcow, Pracownia Ekofizjol Ptakow, Al Legionow 9, PL-80441 Gdansk, Poland",,,,2005-01-01,BCI:BCI200510050703,,

The Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) is an important economic fish species in China, Japan and South Korea due to its high-quality meat. As most Japanese eel elvers for aquaculture are caught in estuaries or seashores, eel farms are often located close to these locations. Therefore, various underwater noises from coastal constructions and ship traffic may influence local eel aquaculture. In this paper, we observed the behaviour of Japanese eel elvers - with body-length from 8 to 10 cm - under exposure to a controllable underwater noise, and we studied the single frequency and noise impact on Japanese eel elvers. Results showed that the Japanese eel elvers were sensitive to the noise of 600-800 Hz, and particularly to 700 Hz.

The main objective of this investigation is to study the load-deflection behavior of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composite deck panels under static loading. Three prototype GFRP composite deck panels each with a size of 3000 turn x 1000 mm x 300mm were fabricated using hand lay-up process and tested under a factored load of AASHTO HS20/lRC Class A wheeled vehicle. The deck panels were analyzed using the standard FE software, ANSYS. Maximum deflection and strain at factored load, and flexural and shear rigidities were calculated in the FE analysis and compared with the experimental data, and also with the specifications given by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), USA. From this study, it is concluded that the fabricated GFRP deck panels satisfied the performance criteria specified by ODOT and can be used in berthing structures, bridges in coastal regions, offshore oil platforms, OTEC systems and also in seismic prone areas.

Broadband impulsive sounds generated by pile driving may disturb and distract marine mammals such as harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena); their concentration may be reduced, affecting the skills they need for foraging (e.g., timing and precision) or reducing their ability to catch prey and, thus, their foraging efficiency. The resulting reduction in fitness may eventually lead to population declines. Therefore, it is important to understand the effects of these anthropogenic sounds on the ability of harbor porpoises to catch fish. Two captive harbor porpoises (porpoise F05 and porpoise M06) performed a fish-catching task (i.e., retrieving dead fish from a net feeding cage) while they were exposed to low ambient noise (quiet conditions) and impulsive pile-driving playback sounds at three (porpoise M06) or four (porpoise F05) mean received single-strike sound exposure levels (SELss) between 125 and 143 dB re 1 mu Pa(2)s. The two study animals differed in their fish-catching success rate at all noise levels, including under quiet conditions: Porpoise F05 was less likely to catch fish than porpoise M06. They also responded differently to increasing SELss: Only porpoise F05 was significantly more likely to terminate trials and less likely to catch fish as SELss increased above 134 dB, but her trial failure rate remained unaffected by increasing SELss. The time taken to catch a fish did not vary with SELss but was slightly longer for porpoise F05 than for porpoise M06. Results suggest that high-amplitude pile driving sounds are likely to negatively affect foraging in some harbor porpoises by decreasing their catch success rate and increasing the termination rate of their fish-catching attempts; the severity of the effects is likely to increase with increasing pile driving SELss. However, individual differences in responses to sound, termination rates, and fish-catching success (even in ambient conditions) may complicate the quantification of the impacts of pile driving sounds on harbor porpoises.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,,,0167-5427,,,,,,,,,,,"Sea Mammal Res Co SEAMARCO, Julianalaan 46, NL-3843 CC Harderwijk, NetherlandsDotmoth, 1 Mendip Villas,Crabtree Lane, Bristol BS41 8LN, Avon, EnglandTNO Acoust & Sonar, Oude Waalsdorperweg 63, NL-2597 AK The Hague, Netherlands",Sea Mammal Res Co SEAMARCODotmothTNO Acoust & Sonar,,,2019-08-02,WOS:000475551700006,,

Factors influencing potential effects were mainly related to species characteristics (morphology, phenology, abundance, behavior, and response to turbines) or site characteristics (landscape features, weather, and habitat quality).

Findings support ringing records in demonstrating a primarily south-eastward movement following the breeding season, with no tracked birds wintering in western Atlantic waters. Fifteen successfully tracked adult birds wintered over a range of about 5000 km on continental shelf seas from NW Scotland to NW Africa with areas of concentration off Africa and in the Celtic Sea. Direct distance from the colony to the most distant point reached ranged from 1200 to 6100 km. Trips amounted to 16,100-33,500 km over the entire migration/winter period. While birds heading for NW Africa mostly showed a relatively straight migration direction, several round trips were recorded in (N)W Europe. Migration trips and over-winter colony absence lasted between 126 and 189 days. Birds departed from the colony from 9 to 24 September and returned from 19 January to 27 March.

The piles are commonly installed using impact driving. A severe disadvantage of this installation method is that high noise levels occur in the water, which are a risk to animals living in the sea. Approval authorities are known to impose statutory requirements to mitigate this risk, placing a financial burden on installation. Vibratory driving is an alternative installation method that reduces noise emission levels significantly. However, the effect of vibro-driving on the bearing behaviour of piles under lateral loading is largely unknown. Full-scale load tests were conducted in predominantly dense, non-cohesive, saturated soil to investigate the differences between impact-driven piles and vibrated piles regarding their lateral bedding behaviour. CPTs and pile head load-displacement curves were recorded and evaluated. In general, it was determined that the bearing behaviour of vibro-driven piles is heavily dependent on the parameters of the installation process. For the installation parameters used in the test campaign, two vibro-driven piles showed a weaker bedding reaction in comparison to the impact-driven piles, although one vibrated pile installed with unintentionally different parameters showed an only slightly weaker behaviour under primary loading and even increased unloading and reloading stiffness. Furthermore, it was observed that an indication regarding the differences in the bedding resistance can be obtained via CPT measurements before and after installation, since the installation procedure considerably affects the relative density of the soil around the pile.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,0,15,,,0172-6145,2190-6653,,,,,,,,,,"Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Geotech, Appelstr 9A, D-30167 Hannover, GermanyACP Grundbau GmbH, Turmstr 12, D-30165 Hannover, GermanyInnogy SE, Kapstadt Ring 7, D-22297 Hamburg, Germany",ACP Grundbau GmbHInnogy SE,,,2020-10-06,WOS:000571382400004,,

As a result of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in April 2010, oil and oil dispersants were introduced into the northern Gulf of Mexico. At the same time, large portions of the Gulf of Mexico were closed to commercial and recreational fishing for most of the 2010 summer. This presented a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of a fish assemblage exposed to changes in two disparate types of anthropogenic disturbances. We compared assemblage data for near-coastal fish (456 samples representing over 45,000 individuals and 109 species) from pre-DWH (before 2010) and post-DWH (2011-2014) to assess potential changes in abundance, diversity (alpha, beta, and gamma), and assemblage structure. In contrast to predicted oil-induced mortality, post-DWH assemblages were characterized by high abundance in 2011 (CPUE across all species pooled was 2.5 times higher than in any other year). This high abundance was most pronounced in medium-sized fish species that are direct targets of commercial fishing or likely bycatch. Abundances returned to levels similar to pre-DWH in 2012, 2013, and 2014. There were no differences in pre- and post-DWH levels of diversity, and shifts in assemblage structure may be consistent with increases driven by reduced fishing pressure. While other assemblages and ecosystems may respond differently, our data for the near-coastal fish assemblage indicated the effects of the DWH were minimal. Rigorous empirical data from other systems are required to assess potential DWH impacts across the range of ecosystems potentially affected.",,,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,24,0,33,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Univ So Mississippi, Dept Biol Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USAMississippi Dept Marine Resources, 1141 Bayview Ave, Biloxi, MS 39530 USA",Mississippi Dept Marine Resources,,,2016-03-09,WOS:000370355000010,,

Although box cores did confirm the higher abundance of both mud shrimps in the exclusion zone and demonstrated greater densities of the brittlestar Amphiura filiformis, they did not clearly reveal the distinctness of the exclusion zone. This is attributed to the large proportion of small, short-living species in the samples and the relative scarcity of vulnerable larger species common to all the box core samples. There was no evidence of greater recruitment in the relative small exclusion zone, despite its positive effect on adult survival.

However, its performance is susceptible to wind turbines which are usually installed on the shore. The size of a wind turbine is much larger than the wavelength of radio waves at UHF band, which results in large radar cross section. Furthermore, the rotation of blades adds time-varying Doppler frequency to the clutter and makes the suppression difficult.

The eastern Canadian Grand Bank has a rich and diverse food web that supports an abundance of apex predators. Major resource extraction industries (hydrocarbon production and fisheries) operate in the area, and, in addition to shipping and hunting, pose risks for marine birds. Understanding the relative risks has been hampered by poor information on bird distribution at sea. Here, we deployed global location sensors (loggers or geolocators) on common murres Uria aalge at Funk Island, the species' largest North American breeding colony. Adults (n=10) were resident on the Grand Bank and in adjacent pelagic waters year round. Within 10 days of leaving the colony, males dispersed offshore (<50 degrees W), southsouth-east of Funk Island. Females departed later and spent 10-47 days in coastal waters before moving offshore. All birds were in the vicinity of offshore oil platforms during November and December, but remained outside the area of the coastal Newfoundland and Labrador murre hunt. Three of six tracked females, but only one of four tracked males moved closer to shore during January and February where vulnerability to the hunt may have increased. Vessel-based surveys confirmed the importance of offshore, shelf-edge habitats for murres in winter.

Analysis of the processed array data also revealed the presence of high-frequency secondary waves at angles steeper than 45 degrees below the horizontal. These secondary waves, which appeared to be generated near the sea-surface, dominated the acoustic spectrum of the pulses at frequencies above 1 kHz. Shallow hydrophone measurements outside the Mach cone showed clear evidence of a surface shadow zone, which was caused by the strong downward directivity of the source. Although reflected waves, diffraction, and secondary waves still produced sound inside the surface shadow zone, sound levels were 10-15 dB lower in this region.

The survival of the Endangered African penguin Spheniscus demersus is closely linked to the availability of pelagic fish prey. This study assesses the influence of oceanographic variables on the spatio-temporal dynamics of pelagic fish in Algoa Bay, South Africa, where half of the world population of African penguins breed on 2 islands, St Croix and Bird. Using small-scale acoustic surveys and an array of underwater oceanographic data recorders spread across the bay during 3 yr, we reveal the complex and variable nature of this system, with fish responding differently to physical processes around each island. Chlorophyll a concentrations were good predictors of relative fish abundance around Bird Island but had little influence around St Croix Island, possibly due to the masking effect of purse-seine fishing around this site. The horizontal distribution of fish schools around Bird Island was more aggregated under upwelling conditions (cooler sea surface temperatures) and the vertical distribution of fish around both islands was strongly influenced by stratification and mean temperatures. Mechanistic drivers of upwelling included northeasterly winds and offshore Natal pulses, both of which are predicted to have an increasingly more significant effect on the suitability of habitat for pelagic fish and associated predators under the influences of climate change and industrial fishing.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,22,1,25,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Cape Town, Percy Fitzpatrick Inst African Ornithol, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South AfricaUniv Cape Town, Dept Stat Sci, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South AfricaSorbonne Univ, UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS IRD MNHN, Lab LOCEAN IPSL, F-75005 Paris, FranceSAEON, Elwandle Coastal Node, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South AfricaNelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Inst Coastal & Marine Res, ZA-6031 Summerstrand, South AfricaNelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Zool, ZA-6031 Summerstrand, South Africa",,,,2017-05-24,WOS:000400344700014,,

Most of the bats killed by turbines thus far have been migratory species that roost in trees throughout the year, and the highest fatality events appear to coincide with autumn migration. Hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) are highly migratory and one of the most frequently killed species at wind turbines. We analyzed a long-term data set to investigate how weather and moonlight influenced the occurrence of hoary bats at an island stopover point along their migration route. We then related our results to the problem of bat fatalities at wind turbines. We found that relatively low wind speeds, low moon illumination, and relatively high degrees of cloud cover were important predictors of bat arrivals and departures, and that low barometric pressure was an additional variable that helped predict arrivals. Slight differences in the conditions under which bats arrived and departed from the island suggest that hoary bats may be more likely to arrive on the island with passing storm fronts in autumn. These results also indicate that fatalities of hoary bats at wind turbines may be predictable events, that the species may be drawn to prominent landmarks that they see during migration, and that they regularly migrate over the ocean. Additional observations from this and other studies suggest that the problem of bat fatalities at wind turbines may be associated with flocking and autumn mating behaviors.

To arrive at a suitable reference dataset, the performance of wind outputs from three different reanalysis datasets is evaluated. The comparison across the RCMs and their corresponding parent GCMs is done on the basis of annual/seasonal wind statistics, intermodel bias, wind climatology, and classes of wind potential. It was observed that while the RCMs could simulate spatial variability of winds, well for certain subregions, they generally failed to replicate the overall spatial pattern, especially in monsoon and winter. Various causes of biases in RCMs were determined by assessing corresponding maps of wind vectors, surface temperature, and sea-level pressure. The results highlight the necessity to carefully assess the RCM-yielded winds before using them for sensitive applications such as coastal vulnerability and hazard assessment. A supplementary outcome of this study is in form of wind potential atlas, based on spatial distribution of wind classes. This could be beneficial in suitably identifying viable subregions for developing offshore wind farms by intercomparing both the RCM and GCM outcomes. It is encouraging that most of the RCMs and GCMs indicate that around 70% of the Indian offshore locations in monsoon would experience mean wind potential greater than 200W/m(2).",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,0,11,,,0177-798X,1434-4483,,,,,,,,,,"Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",,,,2019-05-08,WOS:000464905800044,,

Time-series of chi(CH4), delta C-13-CH4, and delta D-CH4 in ambient air were analysed using the Keeling plot method. Resulting source signatures ranged from -67.4 to -52.4& vs V-PDB and from -372 to -211 & vs V-SMOW, for delta C-13 and delta D respectively, indicating a prevalence of biogenic sources. Analysis of isotope and wind data indicated that (i) emissions from off-shore oil and gas platforms in the North Sea were not detected during this period, (ii) CH4 from fossil fuel related sources was usually advected from the east, pointing towards the Groningen gas field or regions further east in Germany. The results from two atmospheric transport models, CHIMERE and FLEXPART-COSMO, using the EDGAR v4.3.2 and TNO-MACC III emission inventories, reproduce chi(CH4) variations relatively well, but the isotope signatures were over-estimated by the model compared to the observations. Accounting for geographical variations of the delta C-13 signatures from fossil fuel emissions improved the model results significantly. The difference between model and measured isotopic signatures was larger when using TNO-MACC III compared to EDGAR v4.3.2 inventory. Uncertainties in the isotope signatures of the sources could explain a significant fraction of the discrepancy, thus a better source characterisation could further strengthen the use of isotopes in constraining emissions.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,0,14,,,1600-0889,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht IMAU, Utrecht, NetherlandsUniv Groningen, Ctr Isotope Res, Groningen, NetherlandsUniv Versailles St Quentin, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Paris, FranceEmpa, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland",,,,2020-11-24,WOS:000587663200001,,

As a primary stress response, whole-body cortisol seemed to be too sensitive to 'handling' bias. On the other hand, measured secondary stress responses to pile driving showed significant reductions in oxygen consumption rate and low whole-body lactate concentrations. Furthermore, repeated exposure to impulsive sound significantly affected both primary and secondary stress responses. Under laboratory conditions, no tertiary stress responses (no changes in specific growth rate or Fulton's condition factor) were noted in young sea bass 30 days after the treatment.

In the development of the standard requirements, evaluation of actual engineering practices could indicate the level of workplace safety. A study was conducted to identify risk and safety measures concerning the use of timber scaffold boards in construction. This article discusses on the occupational risks and ergonomics issues of the scaffolding application based on the physical and mechanical conditions of tropical timber scaffold boards extracted from offshore oil and gas rigs. The boards were exposed to a seasonal climate of East Coast monsoon of South China Sea between November and February. The scaffolding application extended up to 20 m directly above the ocean surface and some boards were completely immersed below the ocean surface particularly during elevated tidal waves. Some of the boards were installed as the on-deck platforms. Forty scaffold boards fabricated from tropical timber species were evaluated. Physical characteristics of the boards were described by natural and man-made factors. A three-point bending test was conducted to determine the maximum load capacity of each board and the mode of fracture was evaluated. Timber identification test was conducted to identify the groups of the timber being used. The microscopic observation confirmed the presence of hyphae which indicated the biological deterioration has happened in some of the boards.

Special structures such as wind turbine towers have characteristics and exhibit behavior which are significantly different from conventional civil engineering structures. In addition, the stochastic aerodynamic load generated from the turbulence is different from what is generated on conventional tall structures, due to rotationally sampled spectra. Experimental studies on the evaluation of full scale TLDs to control vibration of such special facilities like wind turbine towers are absent in literature. In this paper, the performance of a full-scale TLD in mitigating lateral tower vibrations of multi-megawatt wind turbines is evaluated through the real-time hybrid testing (RTHT). Lateral tower vibrations of wind turbines are normally lightly damped due to low or even negative aerodynamic damping, and large amplitude vibrations induced by wind and ocean wave loads in the lateral direction may significantly shorten the fatigue life of the tower. In the RTHT, the full-scale TLD is tested as the physical substructure while the wind turbine is modeled using a 13-degree-of-freedom (13-DOF) aeroelastic model. Wind turbines with 2 MW and 3 MW capacities have been considered and cases of the TLD with and without damping screens have been tested. Further, the effect of tuning ratios on the damper performance has been studied by changing the mean water level of the tank. Finally, comparison has been performed between the experimental results and the results from an theoretical model of the TLD-wind turbine system. The present study provides strong support and useful guidelines for the application of TLDs in large wind turbines.

In this study, sidescan sonar was used to quantify water-column fish abundance and was compared to the established visual observation methods on SCUBA over four reef sites. Calibrated intensity values measured from sidescan sonar echo returns were used to estimate fish body length and to calculate scaled biomass (g/m(2) reef) from a pooled fish length-weight relationship of commonly observed reef fish in the area. Sidescan sonar methods were equivalent to SCUBA surveys for measuring fish abundance over the same reef areas; however, overall reef-associated abundances measured with sidescan were significantly higher because the sidescan could measure a larger water-column area and furthermore allowed for a rapid assessment of abundance on a greater number of reefs in a single sampling day. Scaled abundance and biomass differed significantly between structural types, with the reefed oil-jacket structures in deeper, federally managed waters showing the highest scaled abundance and biomass. With sidescan methods, five reef sites could be surveyed in one day, demonstrating the capability for macroscale comparisons of fish abundance, biomass, and structural preference among sites.",,,,,,,,,18,1,0,0,15,0,19,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Sch Earth Environm & Marine Sci, Brownsville, TX 78520 USAFlorida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Marathon, FL 33050 USA",,,,2017-11-28,WOS:000415373200014,,

It produced unusually large waves which caused significant damage in communities along the south coast of Newfoundland and the eastern shores of Nova Scotia. Bottom scouring was observed around the feet of three mobile offshore oil and gas drilling platforms operating near Sable Island. Using buoy data enhanced with a detailed data set from one of the platforms, this study examines the growth of destructive waves and the performance of two state-of-the-art third generation ocean wave models running in shallow water mode. The wave models perform well in numerically simulating the extreme waves associated with this storm. They correctly predict the growth of wind waves and handle the arrival of long-period swells well. Unprecedented waves that damaged buildings and a lighthouse in the Channel Head area of Port-Aux-Basques retained most of their deep-water energy until they were less than one wavelength from the beach. Computations show that dynamic (or trapped) fetch was not a contributing factor in the generation of the observed extreme sea states although the long-period swells were supported by winds for a significant part of their transit northward. However, it appears that the model-generated enhanced wave growth at the buoy location just off the southwestern coast of Newfoundland may be partially linked to the creation of model trapped fetch. The January 2000 storm was indeed an extreme storm and was the most intense non-tropical storm to form over Atlantic Canada in decades.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0705-5900,1480-9214,,,,,,,,,,"Environm Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Environm Numer Weather Predict Res Sect, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, CanadaCFB Comox, Weather Serv Ctr Comox, Lazo, BC, CanadaEnvironm Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Climate Data & Anal Sect, Dartmouth, NS, CanadaEnvironm Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Atmospher Numer Weather Predict Res Sect, Dorval, PQ, Canada",CFB Comox,,,2009-03-01,WOS:000265400500006,,

The rig burned out of control for 2 days before being extinguished. We conducted a rapid-response sampling campaign near Hercules 265 after the fire to ascertain if sediments and fishes were polluted above earlier baseline levels. A surface drifter study confirmed that surface ocean water flowed to the southeast of the Hercules site, while the atmospheric plume generated by the blowout was in eastward direction. Sediment cores were collected to the SE of the rig at a distance of approximate to 0.2, 8, and 18 km using a multicorer, and demersal fishes were collected from approximate to 0.2 to 8 km SE of the rig using a longline (508 hooks). Recently deposited sediments document that only high molecular weight (HMW) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations decreased with increasing distance from the rig suggesting higher pyrogenic inputs associated with the blowout. A similar trend was observed in the foraminifera Haynesina germanica, an indicator species of pollution. In red snapper bile, only HMW PAH metabolites increased in 2013 nearly double those from 2012. Both surface sediments and fish bile analyses suggest that, in the aftermath of the blowout, increased concentration of pyrogenically derived hydrocarbons was transported and deposited in the environment.

Population declines in the western North Atlantic are associated with low annual adult survival rates, but trends and vital rates of populations in the eastern North Pacific are poorly known. To address this knowledge gap, we estimated the annual apparent survival of breeding adults at two colonies off the coast of British Columbia (Rock Islets: 52'20'40 '' N, 131'14'10 '' W and Cleland Island: 49 degrees 10'17 '' N, 126 degrees 05'28 '' W), using capture-mark-recapture data collected between 2006 and 2010. Transient models received substantially more support than standard Cormack-Jolly-Seber models, suggesting that the initial capture and banding reduced burrow fidelity. The model-averaged annual apparent survival rates for both colonies were high (estimate for each colony = 0.975 +/- 0.011), compared to rates reported for colonies in the western North Atlantic (< 0.80). Capture effects reduced annual apparent survival estimates for the first year after capture by ca. 6%. Higher apparent adult survival at colonies in the eastern North Pacific may be due to lower exposure to direct and indirect anthropogenic stressors while foraging (specifically, marine oil and gas infrastructure) and reduced avian predation by gulls at breeding colonies. The high survival rates we found suggests that eastern North Pacific populations of Leach's Storm Petrels are under less stress than those in the western North Atlantic.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,7,0,7,,,1018-3337,2074-1235,,,,,,,,,,"Simon Fraser Univ, Ctr Wildlife Ecol, Dept Biol Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, CanadaEnvironm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlffe Res Div, Sci & Technol Branch, 5421 Robertson Rd, Delta, BC V4K 3N2, CanadaHatfenist Environm Consulting, POB 2498, Smithers, BC V0J 2N0, Canada",Hatfenist Environm Consulting,,,2020-05-11,WOS:000528314200019,,

A monitoring framework and standardized protocols that can be applied to multiple types of ORED would streamline scientific study, management, and permitting at these sites. We propose an adaptive and reactive framework based on indicators of the likely changes to the marine ecosystem due to ORED. We developed decision trees to identify suites of impacts at two scales (demonstration and commercial) depending on energy (wind, tidal, and wave), structure (e. g., turbine), and foundation type (e. g., monopile). Impacts were categorized by ecosystem component (benthic habitat and resources, fish and fisheries, avian species, marine mammals, and sea turtles) and monitoring objectives were developed for each. We present a case study at a commercial-scale wind farm and develop a monitoring plan for this development that addresses both local and national environmental concerns.

In this article, a conceptual framework of maritime cohesion is being developed mostly applicable to peopled and crowded seas and a set of relevant indicators to assess it, is proposed. It is based on the triple-model of interdependent components such as maritime spatial efficiency, maritime spatial quality and maritime spatial identity, taking into account the territorial cohesion equivalent, promoted by the Cohesion Policy. Then, in order to broadly analyze the spatial efficiency component, the multi-use concept and management tools, recently given particular emphasis by EU Blue Growth Strategy, are examined thoroughly, using the relevant literature.

The annual trends of PM2.5 and its sources, and their associations with the pathways of air mass backward trajectories were examined. Seven sources were apportioned, namely, primary traffic particles, secondary nitrate and sulphate, biomass burning, diesel particles, aged/contaminated sea salt and mineral/road dust, accounting for more than 90% of measured PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m) mass. The declining trend of PM2.5 mass (0.4 mu g m(-3) per year) was related to lower levels of SO42- (0.2 mu g m(-3) per year) due to SO2 reductions from point and mobile sources. The slower decline for NO3- particles (0.1 mu g m(-3) per year) was attributed to the increasing NH3 emissions in the Midwest. The annual variation of biomass burning particles was associated with fires in the southeast and northwest US. Of the four regions within 500 km from the receptor site, the Gulf Coast and the southeast US accounted cumulatively for more than 65% of PM2.5 mass, nitrate, sulphate and biomass burning aerosol. Overall, more than 50% of PM2.5 and its components originated from sources outside the state.

This approach allowed for the quantitative assessment of the impacts of transport from regions representing diverse mixtures of sources and weather conditions for different types of particles. The findings of this effort demonstrated the influences of emission controls on SO2 and NOx on PM2.5 mass, the potential effect of events (i.e. fires) sensitive to climate change phenomena on air pollution and the potential of offshore activities and shipping emissions to influence air quality in urban areas located more than 1000 km away from the sources.",,,,,,,,,30,3,0,0,18,0,32,,,1680-7316,1680-7324,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA",,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000317605400013,,

We observed significant changes in community structure immediately following the DWH, with a 38% decline in species richness and 26% decline in Shannon-Weiner diversity. Initial shifts were driven by widespread declines across a range of trophic guilds, with subsequent recovery unevenly distributed among guilds and taxa. For example, densities of small demersal invertivores, small demersal browsers, generalist carnivores, and piscivores remained persistently low with little indication of recovery seven years after the DWH. Initial declines among these guilds occurred prior to the arrival of the now-widespread, invasive lionfish (Pterois spp.), but their lack of recovery suggests lionfish predation may be affecting recovery.

Constant amplitude sinewave (si) and trapezoid waveform (generally referred to here as hold-time (h-t)) were used under frequencies of 0.2 Hz, 0.3 Hz and 0.5 Hz and stress ratio of 0.1. Comparison is also made between the crack path in the 5355 TMCP steel under si and h-t in seawater (SW). The role of microstructure in retarding or accelerating fatigue crack growth in SW is also discussed. Experimental results showed that the CFCGR corresponding to the si is higher than that of the h-t for all the load levels and frequencies examined. It was observed that reduction in the f and fatigue load level increased the CFCGR for the h-t but had little effect on the si. Generally, f in the range 0.2-0.5 Hz had little effect; and for a given f an increase in load led to a reduction in the CFCGR, in the Paris Region (PR) for both si and h-t in SW. Under both si and h-t, the CFCGR in the TMCP steels (e.g. S355G8 + M, S355G10 + M) is lower than that of the normalised steels (e.g. S355J2 + N). Metallurgical analyses on the fractured surface of corrosion-fatigue specimens show that the main active crack tip blunting process is the primary factor controlling the CFCGR of steel at high stress intensity factor range (SIFR) and low f in SW.

This paper addresses the response of seabed sand deposits subjected to underlying dip-slip fault movement. The resulting propagation of the faulting offset in seabed sediments is explored using 2D finite element modeling in Abaqus (c) while accounting for nonlinear soil behavior with strain softening. A 2D plain strain FEM seabed model is adopted to investigate the effect of different seabed soil properties and layer thicknesses on the extent and magnitude of seabed surface deformation induced by normal and reverse faults with different dip angles. The results indicate that (1) the adoption of sand properties that depend on depth is necessary to realistically model the fault propagation mechanism, particularly for fault propagation through thick and dense sand deposits, (2) the presentation of fault propagation results in a normalized manner (with respect to sand cover thickness) does not eliminate the dependency on the actual layer thickness, and (3) the deformation of the beds in the cover as a result of basement faulting can be modeled realistically using trishear kinematic approaches.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,1,16,,,0013-7952,1872-6917,,,,,,,,,,"Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 11-0236, Riad El Solh 11072020, Lebanon",,,,2018-05-08,WOS:000430780300014,,

Wind speed and direction from these products were compared to measurements collected at five buoys moored along the Iberian Peninsula Atlantic coast.Results show that WRF modelled offshore winds are the best alternative to in situ measured offshore wind data, showing the highest temporal accuracy (the ability in representing the wind speed and direction at a given time instant) and lowest errors in terms of offshore wind power flux estimations. However, offshore wind data taken from CCMP shows the lowest errors in terms of the mean wind speeds and, together with IFREMER-BWF, the best wind temporal accuracy after WRF simulation. Therefore, in general CCMP and IFREMER-BWF can be considered as the best alternatives to WRF high resolution modelled offshore winds, if the latter is not available. Specifically for offshore wind energy resource assessment, NCEP-CFSR reanalysis or NCEP-GFS analysis data can also be used with confidence as an alternative to WRF modelled data, showing better wind power flux estimates than CCMP and IFREMER-BWF.Despite the best performances of WRF high resolution offshore winds, such modelling tasks require considerable computational resources and time to obtain quality results. Therefore, the value of satellite-derived wind data should not be disregarded. These remotely sensed offshore wind measurements should be seriously considered when searching for alternative sources of wind information for ocean areas, in particular for open ocean areas where they have their strength.

The Gulf of Mexico experiences numerous environmental characteristics that are not always experienced elsewhere in aquaculture development including long distance from shore, exposure to wind and wave action from all directions, strong currents, seasonal anoxic conditions at depth, and periodic presence of a nepheloid layer. Permits have been acquired to operate a 600 m(3) Ocean Spar Sea Station in U.S. federal waters approximately 40 km off the coast of Mississippi near a ChevronTexaco gas platform (29 degrees 58.649'N, 88 degrees 36.297'W). To decrease user conflicts, unintentional damage, and vandalism to grow-out systems, a currently producing manned gas platform site was chosen for the OAC experimental offshore aquaculture operation. To decrease mooring costs, system complexity, and potential environmental impact, the OAC cage is moored on a redundant single-point mooring. Enormous logistical challenges exist for optimal aquaculture operations with increasing distance from shore. Excellent husbandry practices are required to ensure a stress free, healthy stock that is growing in a uniform fashion and innovative technologies developed to allow appropriate levels of feeding, long-distance communication in the absence of cellular phone coverage, and carefully planned levels of response to emergency situations. A potential solution to difficult offshore aquaculture logistics is the design of an aquaculture support vessel for safe aquaculture operations. In addition, mechanization of standard coastal aquaculture practices is a necessity to economically operate an offshore aquaculture venture at a scale that ensures a suitable gross profit margin.

Many factors are involved, and among these, the extra costs incurred by the conservative design of offshore wind energy converters can be quickly addressed at the design stage by accounting for the nonlinear destructive interaction between wind and wave loads. Even when waves approach offshore wind energy converters collinearly with the wind, waves and wind do not always make the offshore wind energy converter's substructure deformed. These environmental loads can intermittently exert a force of resistance against deformation due to the nonlinear destructive interaction between wind and wave loads. Hence, the nonlinear destructive interaction between wave and wind loads deserves much more attention. Otherwise, a very conservative design of offshore wind energy converters will hamper the offshore wind energy industry's development, which is already suffering from enormous initial capital expenditures. In this rationale, this study numerically simulates a 5 MW offshore wind energy converter's structural behavior subject to wind and random waves using the dynamic structural model developed to examine the nonlinear destructive interaction between wind and wave loads. Numerical results show that the randomly fluctuating water surface as the wind blows would restrict the offshore wind energy converter's substructure's deflection. Nonuniform growth of the atmospheric boundary layer due to the wavy motions at the water surface as the wind blows results in a series of hairpin vortices, which lead to the development of a large eddy out of hairpin vortices swirling in the direction opposite to the incoming wind near the atmospheric boundary layer. As a result, the vertical profile of the longitudinal wind velocity is modified; the subsequent energy loss drastically weakens the wind velocity, which consequently leads to the smaller deflection of the substructure of the offshore wind energy converter by 50% when compared with that in the case of wind with gusts over a calm sea.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,2077-1312,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Seoul, Dept Civil Engn, Seoul 02504, South Korea",,,,2021-01-12,WOS:000601941500001,,

Genotoxicity was reflected by a hepatic DNA adduct pattern typical for exposure to a mixture of PAHs. Control material was collected from a North Sea area without oil production and from remote Icelandic waters. The difference between the two control areas indicates significant background pollution in the North Sea. ConclusionIt is most remarkable to obtain biomarker responses in natural fish populations in the open sea that are similar to the biomarker responses in fish from highly polluted areas close to a point source. Risk assessment of various threats to the marine fish populations in the North Sea, such as overfishing, global warming, and eutrophication, should also take into account the ecologically relevant impact of offshore oil production.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2013-08-15,DRCI:DATA2013072003283298,,

Reference organisms were collected on a seasonal basis from an unpolluted site and transplanted for four weeks in both the sampling area and to the investigated platform. Chemical analyses of trace metals in mussel tissues were integrated with a multi-biomarker approach for the early detection of biological responses at several cellular targets. Induction of metallothioneins, peroxisomal proliferation and activity of acetylcholinesterase were measured as markers for specific classes of chemicals. Special attention was given to oxyradical metabolism and appearance of oxidative-mediated toxicity to reveal a more general onset of cellular disturbance. In addition to individual antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferases, glutathione reductase, Se-dependent and Se-independent glutathione peroxidases, and levels of total glutathione), the total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) allowed a quantification of the overall capability to neutralize specific forms of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS; i.e. peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals). Cellular damages were evaluated as lysosomal destabilization (membrane stability, accumulation of lipofuscin and neutral lipids), lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde) and DNA integrity (strand breaks and micronuclei); the air survival test was finally applied to evaluate the overall physiological condition of mussels. Concentration of trace metals (As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) revealed only limited variations in transplanted mussels during various experimental periods and such changes appeared partly related to natural fluctuations. Among biological responses, variations of antioxidants and lysosomal stability were confirmed as sensitive early warning signals for biological disturbance of both natural and anthropogenic origin. The presented protocol with caged mussels allowed marked biological effects caused by the investigated platform to be excluded, and represented a useful approach that is easy to extend for monitoring the impact of offshore activities in the Adriatic sea.

Different age classes and groups were identified and some spatial difference was detected based on the distribution of sightings. Humpback whales were more abundant in October when most of the sightings and the major activity were observed. Mother-calf pairs were more frequent in October and their spatial distribution within the bay was wider than in other months. Most of the sightings involved both solitary individuals and adults with small calves. Water depth seems to be the main physical reference influencing the distribution of humpback whales in Sechura Bay. Based on the seasonal occurrence of individuals and the presence of very small calves, Sechura Bay is suggested as a nursery ground and migratory reference as well as a probable breeding ground in Northern Peru for humpback whales.

For such structures, compared with the gravitational loads, cyclic lateral loading may often be more critical for the analysis and design. The lateral load-carrying capacity of a pile depends on its geometry (dimensions), the soil properties and type of loading. In order to increase its lateral load-carrying capacity, it is necessary either to change the properties of the near-surface layers of soil or to change its geometry. This paper presents model studies investigating a novel technique to limit the lateral deflection (rotation) of a monopile under long-term cyclic lateral loading. The technique provides enhanced restraint of the monopile through the installation of four shorter piles, arranged in a cruciform, which attach to the head of the central monopile by way of a grillage. Different aspects of this modification, including its fabrication and attachment to the monopile, are presented. Its efficiency in reducing the monopile rotation under cyclic lateral loading is evaluated through a comprehensive testing programme, with reasonably encouraging results.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,1353-2618,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Geol Engn, Lahore, PakistanTrinity Coll Dublin, Dept Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Dublin, Ireland",,,,2016-09-22,WOS:000381948700002,,

A key proposed advantage of MSP is that it makes tradeoffs in resource use and sector (stakeholder group) values explicit, but doing so requires tools to assess tradeoffs. We extended tradeoff analyses from economics to simultaneously assess multiple ecosystem services and the values they provide to sectors using a robust, quantitative, and transparent framework. We used the framework to assess potential conflicts among offshore wind energy, commercial fishing, and whale-watching sectors in Massachusetts and identify and quantify the value from choosing optimal wind farm designs that minimize conflicts among these sectors. Most notably, we show that using MSP over conventional planning could prevent >$1 million dollars in losses to the incumbent fishery and whale-watching sectors and could generate >$10 billion in extra value to the energy sector. The value of MSP increased with the greater the number of sectors considered and the larger the area under management. Importantly, the framework can be applied even when sectors are not measured in dollars (e. g., conservation). Making tradeoffs explicit improves transparency in decision-making, helps avoid unnecessary conflicts attributable to perceived but weak tradeoffs, and focuses debate on finding the most efficient solutions to mitigate real tradeoffs and maximize sector values. Our analysis demonstrates the utility, feasibility, and value of MSP and provides timely support for the management transitions needed for society to address the challenges of an increasingly crowded ocean environment.",,,,,,,,,296,15,0,0,162,0,330,,,0027-8424,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA",,,,2012-03-20,WOS:000301712600069,22392996,

J,,,,,,,,,,,Dynamics of Mooring System for Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2018,2018,"In deep water offshore, mooring systems can contribute significantly to the total cost of the system. Whilst this may not be such a compelling issue with the offshore oil and gas industry where profit is very large, it is vital factor for FOWTs where accomplishing a cost effective and profitable system is the one of the main challenges facing developers. As installed capacity increases and shallow water near shore sites are exhausted, projects will need to be developed further from shore and in deeper water, which will pose greater technical challenges and constrain efforts to reduce costs. There are a number of floating wind concepts currently under development, but there is no clear favourite at this stage with regard to which concept is most likely to be deployed at industrial scale in the future as other ideas are being proposed and investigated.In terms of technology development of floating offshore wind turbine, it is essential to have a clear understanding about the structure behaviour in harsh environment as well as to consider a sustainable, reliable, and cost effective mooring and anchor system. This means, it is important to demonstrate how the mooring, anchoring and cabling elements of the system can be utilized aim for improving levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the lifecycle of the wind farm. Therefore, there is a need for improved understanding of those factors to drive towards large scale development.This project concentrates on developing reliable methods to solve the static and dynamic response of mooring lines to examine how this knowledge transfers into the design of mooring system in terms of technical requirements and guidelines on design and construction of positioning mooring system.This study will use realistic met-ocean data (wave, wind, current and geotechnical) which represents shallow and deep water sites suitable for wind farms of more than 100 floating wind turbines. In order to develop the innovative technologies required to reduce the cost, experiences from industries leading this concept can be adapted for establishing a base case design of a FOWT. The key elements of the mooring system include catenary and semi taut mooring lines with disconnecting ability, top loaded suction piles and tensioning mooring line at anchor to investigate the coupled dynamics of the mooring and platform dynamics. Better estimation of extreme forces and the distribution of fatigue loads will enable to find more realistic, and thereby more economic safety factors that meet an acceptable probability of failure.The following presents a short summary of the new and innovative aspects addressed in the course of this project.- Numerical investigation of different types of 10MW FOWT system dynamic behaviour in irregular wave conditions, facing unsteady wind by applying combined aerodynamics, hydrodynamic, current forces on the system. Coupled analysis will be conducted for a range of operating conditions and to evaluate system safety in survival conditions. - Identify optimised mooring configurations for FOWT through a thorough investigation of various key aspects such as material properties, mooring layout and anchor properties and their influence on the fatigue life of key components.- Investigate symmetric and asymmetric mooring systems to evaluate critical safety aspects in case of failure, especially for closely spaced arrays and in case of anchor sharing.- Apply analytical methods of FOWT design optimization with the aim to study the detailed influence of various design constraints (eigenfrequency, extreme load and fatigue load constraints) on the structural design and the performance optimization procedure.- Conduct an experimental model test of a 10MW FOWT complete system including unsteady wind, irregular wave and current forces.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2029586,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15311400,,

Annual growth increment counts were carried out on sagittal otoliths of 415 specimens ranging from 80 to 280 mm TL. The accuracy of age estimates was assessed by testing the annual deposition of annuli and the location of the first annulus by marginal increment analysis and daily growth increment counts, respectively. As commonly observed in other scorpaenids, annuli consisted of an alternating pattern of opaque and translucent zones. Marginal increment analysis confirmed that annuli are formed once a year, with opaque zones laid down in spring-summer and translucent zones laid down in autumn-winter. The precision of age estimates was tested by applying both the average percent error (APE) and the mean coefficient of variation (CV). The maximum age estimated for the whole sampled populations was 8 years. The von Bertalanffy growth curves were separately fitted for natural and artificial reef populations of S. porcus.

With seawatching the migration of mostly larger species (waterbirds in the broadest sense) over the sea was recorded and islandwatching concentrated on the migration of smaller species (mostly passerines) over land (islands in this case). The particular goal of this study is the synoptic observation at three locations at least during the migration periods.Apart from some exceptions, at all three sites seawatching showed the highest migration intensity in the morning hours, much less migration occurred at midday and in the evening. Varying proportions of species are mainly caused by the different breeding and staging/wintering areas, whereby the three sites are touched by the birds to a greater or lesser extent. This phenomenon is most obvious in geese.With seawatching in the first three hours after sunrise a total of 185 species was recorded (154 near Sylt, 137 near Helgoland and 148 near Wangerooge). For 23 species, which were abundant or are regarded to be critical concerning effects of offshore wind turbines, the seasonal and daily patterns of migration intensity are described and shown in graphs, diurnal variation of migration intensity for 15 species and flock size for 11 species. In many species, migration was more intense near Sylt in autumn and near Wangerooge in spring, whereas a more balanced relation of the two migration periods was typical for Helgoland. During both seasons the daily migration intensity of the three sites was highly significantly correlated. That holds true for the overall picture of all species as well as for the migration intensities of many particular species. Due to the geographical locations of the breeding and wintering areas of most species, a general direction of migration along a SW-NE-axis can be expected. However, the results of seawatching could prove this only for Helgoland. Near Sylt and Wangerooge, most birds followed the coastline, i.e. they migrated along a S-N-axis and W-E-axis, respectively.With islandwatching in the first three hours after sunrise a total of 189 species was observed (165 above Sylt, 133 above Helgoland and 161 above Wangerooge). Phenology are described and presented graphically for 23 relatively abundant species, flock size for 10 species. As with seawatching, migration intensity was lower at Helgoland than at the two coastal islands and showed roughly the same amount of birds during spring and autumn migration. As a consequence of the preference of most passerines to migrate along a leading line, migration was stronger for many species in autumn at Sylt and more pronounced in spring at Wangerooge: While relatively few birds headed towards the sea at Sylt (autumn) and Wangerooge (spring), the great majority of birds followed the coastline southward (Sylt in autumn) and eastward (Wangerooge in spring), respectively. Obviously, passerines avoided to fly towards the open sea during daytime and followed the coastline instead. Hence, the few birds arriving from sea produced low migration intensities at Sylt in spring and at Wangerooge in autumn. The SW-NE-direction predominating in bird migration in Central Europe was only approved at Helgoland. But even there, jetties of the harbour acted as leading lines, because in autumn many passerines left the island towards SE and S. Because of the leading line effects at Wangerooge (spring) and Sylt (autumn) the connection was strongest between the sites representing migration over sea, i.e. between Helgoland and arrivals above Sylt in spring, but between Helgoland and arrivals above Wangerooge in autumn. This held true for all species together as well as for the single species.KH & OH: Institut fur Vogelforschung Vogelwarte Helgoland, Inselstation, P.O.Box 1220, D-27494 Helgoland, Germany.

Coastal destruction, dredging, mining, offshore infrastructure, oil and gas production, pollution, and climate change are among the main anthropogenic threats faced by marine ecosystems, but fisheries have become the human activity with the greatest and most widespread impact upon reefs and other benthic ecosystems. During recent decades, some international conventions have aimed to reduce these impacts, trying also to bring together governments in order to stop the loss of biodiversity in the oceans. However, marine conservation still lags far behind the advances that have been made in the protection of terrestrial ecosystems. Most marine species and habitats are generally not well known or valued by decisionmakers or the general public, and many efforts to introduce conservation measures have been blocked as a result of intensive lobbying by the bottom trawling sector. As a result, advances in management, including conservation, have been slow. There is a general consensus about the need to protect different marine habitats, ecosystems, and communities that are very productive and useful for humankind in many different ways. These are ecosystems which support the life cycles of commercial species, are essential for the global economy, form biodiversity hotspots, or are part of spectacular seascapes that constitute part of natural heritage. Yet the way forward for the conservation of animal forests worldwide is uncertain; there is still a broad and interesting debate on what should be done to protect them, and how this protection should be developed and implemented, both within national waters and in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Advances in international and national policies related to conservation and fisheries management have provided the first steps. However, these developments only address the tip of the iceberg of what should be done, based on the available scientific knowledge. Seamounts, submarine canyons, hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, and other topographic features are known in many cases to be important biodiversity hotspots. Coral reefs, sponge aggregations, gorgonian and black coral gardens, sea pen fields, mollusk beds, and other animal forests have been recognized as key habitats which occur in many cases in association with topographic features such as the ones mentioned above. Most of these ecosystems are gradually becoming part of the international list of vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs), and in some regions, measures are being developed to protect them, particularly within Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Marine science continuously provides data on new species, habitats, and communities, improving our understanding of their interspecific relationships, and the roles they play within marine ecosystems, and in the biosphere as a whole. In turn, marine management, including conservation, should also progress in light of this increasing knowledge. Human impacts must be necessarily included in the final equation, as we will continue to use marine resources. Ultimately, we are responsible for ensuring the long-term sustainability and health of the ocean realm.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,8,0,10,,,,,978-3-319-21011-7,,,,,,,,,"Oceana, Madrid, Spain",,,,2017-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15909064792,,

It is important to monitor such areas in order to detect, understand and remediate environmental responses to stressors. The natural heterogeneity and complexity of communities means that accurate monitoring requires high resolution, both temporally and spatially, as well as more complete assessments of taxa. Increased resolution and taxonomic coverage is economically challenging using current microscopy-based monitoring practices. Alternatively, DNA sequencing-based methods have been suggested for cost-efficient monitoring, offering additional insights into ecosystem function and disturbance. Here, we applied DNA metabarcoding of eukaryotic communities in marine sediments, in areas of offshore drilling on the Norwegian continental shelf. Forty-five samples, collected from seven drilling sites in the Troll/Oseberg region, were assessed, using the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene as a taxonomic marker. In agreement with results based on classical morphology-based monitoring, we were able to identify changes in sediment communities surrounding oil platforms. In addition to overall changes in community structure, we identified several potential indicator taxa, responding to pollutants associated with drilling fluids. These included the metazoan orders Macrodasyida, Macrostomida and Ceriantharia, as well as several ciliates and other protist taxa, typically not targeted by environmental monitoring programmes.

Our aim was to describe and quantify the dynamic coupling between the distribution of marine species (seabirds) and the natural variability of their habitat in real time through the combination of a high-resolution hydrodynamic model, aerial digital surveys and real-time species distribution modelling. We used a 2-step (delta) generalized additive model at 500 m spatial resolution for assessment and prediction of the changing patterns of wintering red-throated divers (RTDs) Gavia stellata in the outer Thames estuary, United Kingdom. Our dynamic species distribution models successfully resolved the major oscillations in the distribution of RTDs and confirmed their tight association with frontal zones where the probability of prey encounter was higher. The relative model standard errors (%) were generally below 30% in the high-density areas. Area under the curve (AUC) values indicated that the models were capable of distinguishing presence from absence about 75% of the time. The predictive power of the achieved distribution models made it possible to accurately identify areas where RTDs were concentrated. Comparisons between visual aerial and digital stills aerial surveys documented that, in spite of similar patterns, the aerial digital surveys generally recorded significantly higher densities of RTDs than the visual aerial surveys.

To better understand interactions between birds and human activities in the marine environment, telemetry is routinely used to characterize the area use of species, but evaluations are often based on a small number of individuals taken as representative of a local population studied. Furthermore, the relative importance of the number of animals required and for what duration they should be tracked has received little attention. We examined the central-place foraging movements of 24 lesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus) from a protected population from 1 March to 31 August during 2010-2013. Using bootstrapping and non-linear modeling, we investigated whether sample sizes were sufficient to characterize offshore area use by considering the cumulative area use for an increasing number of birds and duration of tracking. Box-and-whisker analysis suggested a minimum of 13 birds and a precautionary upper maximum of 41 birds were needed to describe 95% of the estimated area use of the population (defined by 100% occupancy). Tracking fewer birds for longer was more important than tracking more birds for less time. A period of 145 days was required to characterize area use for 13-41 birds; however, offshore areas were used primarily after May, meaning that a 97-day tracking period from May onwards was also representative. Predicted and observed areas were strongly correlated, and the predicted area of 15 birds for 151 days was 91% of the total estimated for the population. These findings suggest that the data were suitable for determining interaction with offshore developments, and were characteristic of the population. This study has revealed the power of a long-term tracking dataset, and has uncovered further complexities surrounding study design and analysis that may shape conclusions drawn. The method and considerations raised have wider applicability for other datasets where human-wildlife resource use conflicts need to be assessed.

When removing most of the fishing grounds the fully constrained potential is 2500 GW, only 13% of the theoretical wind energy potential. If areas used by only one community are included then this increases to 30% of the theoretical potential, or 5766 GW. The technical installed capacity for 6 MW turbines is 131 GW with fishing grounds exploited by at most one fishing community included, and of 52 GW for the fully-constrained problem, i.e. with no fishing grounds included. The latter is equivalent to 84% of Mexico's total energy production. Exploiting these resources would be crucial for the country's current and future sustainable development, but it is necessary to implement flexible and dynamic marine spatial plans, and include all stakeholders and regulators in the analysis and decision-making process.

Owing to the relatively small number of existing developments and the early stage of their associated environmental monitoring programmes, the effects of MREDs on seabirds are not fully known. Our ability to fully predict potential effects is limited by a lack of knowledge regarding movements of seabirds at sea. We used GPS tracking to improve our understanding of the movements at sea of a protected seabird species breeding in Scotland, the great skua (Stercorarius skua), to better predict how this species may be affected by MREDs. We found that the overlap of great skuas with leased and proposed MREDs was low; particularly with offshore wind sites, which are predicted to present a greater risk to great skuas than wave or tidal-stream developments. Failed breeders overlapped with larger areas of MREDs than breeding birds but the overall overlap with core areas used remained low. Overlap with wave energy development sites was greater than for offshore wind and tidal-stream sites. Comparison of 2011 data with historical data indicates that distances travelled by great skuas have likely increased over recent decades. This suggests that basing marine spatial planning decisions on short-term tracking data could be less informative than longer-term data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

There has been great effort on developing highly sophisticated numerical model to better understand its hydrodynamic behaviour. A engineering-practical method to study the nonlinear wave effects on floating wind turbine has been recently developed. Based on the method established, the focus of this paper is to quantify the wave nonlinearity effect due to nonlinear wave kinematics by comparing the structural responses of floating wind turbine when exposed to irregular linear Airy wave and fully nonlinear wave. Critical responses and fatigue damage are studied in operational conditions and short-term extreme values are predicted in extreme conditions respectively. In the operational condition, wind effects are dominating the mean value and standard deviation of most responses except floater heave motion. The fatigue damage at the tower base is dominated by wind effects. The fatigue damage for the mooring line is more influenced by wind effects for conditions with small wave and wave effects for conditions with large wave. The wave nonlinearity effect becomes significant for surge and mooring line tension for large waves while floater heave, pitch motion, tower base bending moment and pontoon axial force are less sensitive to the nonlinear wave effect. In the extreme condition, linear wave theory underestimates wave elevation, floater surge motion and mooring line tension compared with fully nonlinear wave theory while quite close results are predicted for other responses.",,,,,,,,,26,1,0,0,2,0,27,,,0141-1187,1879-1549,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Marine Technol, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayOcean Univ China, Shandong Prov Key Lab Ocean Engn, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaTech Univ Denmark, Dept Mech Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, DenmarkHarbin Engn Univ, Shipbldg Engn Inst, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R ChinaNTNU, Ctr Ships & Ocean Struct CESOS, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayNTNU, Ctr Autonomous Marine Operat & Syst AMOS, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2019-10-22,WOS:000489355300017,,

The study shows that, although waves and winds are generally strongly correlated, in some conditions their correlation is lower and the combined energy harvesting more interesting. As spatial conflicts of sea use and demand for maritime space are increasing, the development of the marine renewable energy sector needs to be evaluated in the perspective of the cumulative pressures deriving from present activities or expected from future developments. The evaluation of areas of potential conflicts among human activities, environmental vulnerabilities and marine renewable developments may facilitate the early development of mitigation actions and negotiations between stakeholders. In this study the opportunity of co-locating offshore wind turbines and wave energy converters is analyzed through a spatial planning approach. Both the potential for combining different renewable technologies, and the impact associated to such development was considered in the context of the existing pressures (e.g., naval traffic; mariculture activities; submarine cables routes; dredge spoils dumping; offshore activities; windfarms and ocean energy projects) and vulnerabilities (Marine Protected Areas, Key habitat presence) through quantitative indicators. The portion of Tyrrhenian coast south of Elba island, the northern-western Sardinian coast, and the southern Adriatic and Ionian coastal waters appear to be the most suitable sites.

On the bright side, various methods are devised to capture energy from renewable energy or waste heat from different sectors. Among all inspected approaches, waste heat capturing through cooling process of the wind turbines' generators for desalination at small scale is paid less attention. However, in large wind farms, the scale of this dissipated thermal heat becomes appreciable which can drive several desalination units.Due to the above-pointed facts, the waste heat of a wind turbine with nominal capacity of 7358 kW and height of 24 m for desalinating seawater is inspected here, using a humidification-dehumidification (HDH) unit. Also, five nanoparticles of Cu, CuO, TiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2 with base fluid of water are used through the cooling process of the wind turbine's generator in order to produce more freshwater. The devised set-up is evaluated in terms of the first and second laws of thermodynamics for different selected nanofluids. It is found that wind turbine has the highest exergy destruction of 1125 kW, followed by heater. Also, the total exergy destruction (for all nanofluids) is calculated approximately 1387 kW. Also, among all employed nanoparticles, Cu/water mixture has the highest performance since it produces more freshwater, while SiO2/water mixture has the lowest performance.

Thus wind turbine health is commonly assessed monitoring series of $10$-minute SCADA and high frequency data from sensors. To monitor wind turbine vibrations, normal behaviour models are built to predict tower top accelerations and drive-train vibrations. Signal deviations from model prediction are labelled as anomalies and are further investigated. More efficient models are expected to help enhancing the identification of abnormal behaviour. In this paper we assess a stochastic approach to reconstruct the $1$ Hz tower top acceleration signal, which was measured in a wind turbine located at the wind farm Alpha Ventus in the German North Sea. We compare the resulting data reconstruction with that of a model based on a neural network, which has been previously reported as a data-mining algorithm suitable for reconstructing this signal. In order to focus the discussion on the similarities and differences of both approaches, we limit our evaluation to a single input-output system; in doing so, we avoid other differences, i.e. loading type, pre-processing or model complexity. Our results present evidence that the stochastic approach outperforms the neural network in the high frequency domain ($1$ Hz). Although neural network retrieve accurate step-forward predictions, with low mean square errors, the stochastic approach predictions better preserve the statistics and the frequency components of the original signal, remaining high accuracy levels. The implementation of our stochastic approach is available as open source code and can easily be adapted for other situations involving stochastic data reconstruction. Based on our findings we argue that such an approach could be implemented in signal reconstruction for monitoring purposes or for abnormal behaviour detection.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-03-31,PPRN:50035670,,

Predictions of relative abundance (individuals per kilometer of survey transect) were obtained for each 4 km x 4 km grid cell, and compared with the median number of hours per day that porpoises were acoustically detected in those cells. There was a significant, but weak, correlation between predicted relative abundance and acoustic estimates of occurrence, but this was stronger when predictions with high standard errors were omitted. When grid cells were grouped into those with low, medium, and high predicted relative abundance, there were similarly significant differences in acoustic detections, indicating that porpoises were acoustically detected more often in cells where the habitat model predicted higher numbers.

Three-hundred and seventeen call sequences were recorded during typical migration times in spring and autumn and assigned to at least 23 Nathusius pipi-strelles (Pipistrellus nathusius), 3 northern bats (Eptesicus nilssonii) and 2 Leisler's bats (Nyctalus leisleri). Compared to the prevailing wind conditions, more bats than expected were recorded at lower wind speeds and southerly winds. Bats occurred under supporting tailwinds, but also under strong headwinds. In both seasons most bats occurred under winds from the south (i.e.crosswinds), which indicates offshore wind drift. We neither found effects of air pressure, nor of change in air pressure. Most registrations coincided with a dense cover of clouds, fog/low stratus and/or rain. From the structure of echolocation calls it can be concluded that most bats explored the platform rather than just passed it on transfer flights, some even foraged there. We conclude that most of the bats were on migration and attracted by the brightly lit platform and/or sought refuge there. This involves the risk of collisions with offshore wind turbines (which need to be brighter lit at sea than onshore).

Environmental conditions observed in the study area during the oil spill (2010) were compared to historical observations (2005-2009), to support the contention that variations observed in zooplankton assemblage structure may be attributed to the oil spill, as opposed to natural climatic or environmental variations. Zooplankton assemblage structure observed during the oil spill period (May-August) in 2010 was then compared to historical observations from the same period (2005-2009). Significant variations were detected in assemblage structure in May and June 2010, but these changes were no longer significant by July 2010. The density of ostracods, cladocerans and echinoderm larvae were responsible for most of the differences observed, but patterns differed depending on taxa and months. Many taxa had higher densities during the oil spill year, including calanoid and cyclopoid copepods, ostracods, bivalve larvae and cladocerans, among others. Although this result is somewhat surprising, it is possible that increased microbial activity related to the infusion of oil carbon may have stimulated secondary production through microbial-zooplankton trophic linkages. Overall, results suggest that, although changes in zooplankton community composition were observed during the oil spill, variations were weak and recovery was rapid.",,,,,,,,,28,1,0,0,23,0,37,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Marine Sci & Fisheries, Coll Agr & Marine Sci, Al Khoud 123, OmanDauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA",,,,2014-12-01,WOS:000347454800004,,

The main symptoms are excessive sleepiness and insomnia temporally associated with the working schedule. The aim of the present study was to examine SWD among shift workers in the North Sea.Design and Participants: A total of 103 shift workers (2 weeks on 7 nights/7days, 12-h shifts, 4 weeks off), mean age 39.8 years, working at an oil rig in the North Sea responded to a questionnaire about SWD. They also completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Bergen Insomnia Scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Composite Morningness Questionnaire, Subjective Health Complaint Inventory, Demand/Control, and Instrumental Mastery Oriented Coping (based on the Utrecht Coping list). Most of these instruments were administered during the first day of the 2-week working period, thus reflecting symptoms and complaints during the 4-week non-work period. The shift workers were also compared to day workers at the oil rig.Results: Twenty-four individuals were classified as suffering from SWD, yielding a prevalence for SWD of 23.3%. During the 4-week non-work period, individuals with SWD reported significantly poorer sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and more subjective health complaints than individuals not having SWD. There were no differences between the 2 groups in sleepiness, insomnia, circadian preference, psychological demands, or control. Individuals with SWD reported significantly lower scores on coping. The reports of shift workers without SWD were similar to those of day workers regarding sleep, sleepiness, subjective health complaints, and coping.Conclusions: The prevalence of SWD was relatively high among these shift workers.

Meiofaunal polychaetes, however, are sensitive to contaminants, easy to culture, and representative of the interstitial habitat. These are desirable attributes for ecotoxicological assessments of marine and estuarine sediments. The meiofaunal polychaete, Dinophilus gyrociliatus Schmidt, 1857, is a cosmopolitan species that has become a useful tool for ecotoxicological assessments, particularly for its use in toxicity testing with sediment pore waters. Due to its short life cycle it is suitable for sublethal toxicity tests, with egg production by the females as a sensitive endpoint, which can be assessed in a 7-day exposure period. Toxicity assessments of pore waters from an industrialized bay in Texas, U. S. A., and of pore waters from sediments spiked with nitroaromatic explosives, demonstrated that the D. gyrociliatus reproduction endpoint was consistently among the most sensitive, when compared to early-life stage tests with several other marine species, including macro-algae, sea urchins and fish. There was also excellent agreement among the results of porewater tests with D. gyrociliatus, nauplii of the meiofaunal copepod, Longipedia americana, and embryos of the sea urchin, Arbacia punctulata in a survey with pore waters extracted from sediments collected in the vicinity of an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico, where metals were the primary contaminants of concern.",,,,,,,,,13,1,0,0,12,0,14,,,0018-8158,,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Ctr Coastal Studies, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USATexas A&M Univ, US Geol Survey, Columbia Environm Res Ctr, Marine Ecotoxicol Res Stn, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA",,,,2003-04-01,WOS:000185919300033,,

This nutrient loading increased nearly 300% since 1950, primarily due to increased use of agricultural fertilizers. Over this same time period, the red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) population in the Gulf of Mexico has shifted strongly from being dominated by the eastern Gulf of Mexico to being dominated by the northern and western Gulf of Mexico, with the bulk of the current population in the same regions with significant nutrient loading from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers and in or near areas with development of mid-summer hypoxic zones. The population decline of red snapper in the eastern Gulf is almost certainly attributable to overfishing, but the cause of the population increase in the northern and western Gulf is subject to broad debate, with the impact of artificial reefs (primarily oil platforms which have incr eased greatly since the 1960s) being the most contentious point. Nutrient loading has been shown to positively impact secondary production of fish in many marine systems. The present paper offers the hypothesis that increased nutrient loading has contributed significantly to increased red snapper population in the northern and western Gulf of Mexico. Nutrient loading may be working in synergy with the abundant oil platforms both increasing primary production and providing structure encouraging red snapper to feed throughout the water column.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-11-15,PPRN:22645426,,

(II) Marine ecological safety has not become the main concern of national security. Oil spills are disasters because humans spare no efforts to get economic benefits from oil. The present paper draws another conclusion that marine ecological damage caused by oil spills can be roughly divided into two categories: damage to marine resource value (direct value) and damage to marine ecosystem service value (indirect value).

However, it fails to offer a holistic view to see the whole picture of interactions between various uses as well as a mechanism to engage in coordination among sectors and between levels of governments. In order to solve this failure, Taiwan's government stipulated a new dedicated law, the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), in 2015 to supplement existing sectoral management and promote sustainable development of coastal zones in an integrated way. This paper aims to examine Taiwan's coastal management framework with an emphasis on the CZMA. It specifically illustrates the practical application of the CZMA on offshore wind farms, which have recently gained momentum in Taiwan's pursuit of renewable energy.

It concludes with a summary of commonly used habitat mapping technologies. Benthic (seafloor) habitats are physically distinct areas of seabed that are associated with particular species, communities, or assemblages that consistently occur together. Benthic habitat maps are spatial representations of physically distinct areas of seabed that are associated with particular groups of plants and animals. Habitat maps can illustrate the nature, distribution, and extent of distinct physical environments and, importantly, they can predict the distribution of the associated species and communities.The data sets collected for constructing habitat maps provide fundamental information that can be used for a range of management and industry applications, including the management of fisheries, spatial marine environmental management, design of marine reserves, supporting offshore oil and gas infrastructure development, port and shipping channel construction, maintenance dredging, tourism, and seabed aggregate mining. Seafloor habitat mapping provides fundamental baseline information for decision makers working in these sectors.GeoHab (www.geohab.org) is an international association of marine scientists conducting research using a range of mapping technologies in the study of biophysical (i.e., geologic and oceanographic) indicators of benthic habitats and ecosystems as proxies for biological communities and species diversity. Using this approach, combinations of physical attributes of the seabed identify habitats that have been demonstrated to be effective surrogates for the benthic communities that they typically support. Thus, management priorities can be identified using seabed habitat maps as a guide. The work of GeoHab demonstrates how knowledge of seabed properties can be employed to guide marine environmental management, marine resource management, and conservation efforts.Seafloor geomorphology is one of the most useful physical attributes of the seabed mapped and measured by GeoHab scientists. Different geomorphic features (e.g., submarine canyons, seamounts, atolls, and fjords) are commonly associated with particular suites of habitats. Knowledge of the geomorphology and biogeography of the seafloor has improved markedly over the past 10 years. Using multibeam sonar, submarine features such as fjords, sand banks, coral reefs, seamounts, canyons, and spreading ridges have been revealed in unprecedented detail. The 57 case studies presented in this book represent a range of seabed geomorphic features where detailed bathymetric maps have been combined with seabed video and sampling to yield an integrated picture of the benthic communities that are associated with different types of benthic habitat.",,,,,,,,,58,1,0,0,22,0,60,,,,,978-0-12-385141-3; 978-0-12-385140-6,,,,,,,,,"Geosci Australia, Marine & Coastal Environm Grp, Canberra, ACT, AustraliaUniv Sydney, Arendal Sch Geosci, UNEP GRID, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,,,2012-01-01,WOS:000322237000003,,

These fluctuations are quite different than those observed in microwave radars, such as pulse-to-pulse or scan-to-scan fluctuations (which are modeled as different Swerling-type targets), and as are mentioned in most of the classical radar handbooks. In order to understand the reason behind these fluctuations, the behavior of the target reflectivity and radar cross section (RCS) of surface and air targets and their mutual RCS interaction were investigated. Powerful numerical techniques were used to model and understand the target reflectivity and RCS interactions, mostly in the resonance regime. Different scenarios were created, and the mutual RCS behavior of nearby large targets (such as oil tankers and/or fixed offshore oil platforms) as they were maneuvering were modeled.

A total of 51 fine-scale surveys and 474 d of hydrophone deployment at 2 stations were analysed by partial least squares regression and spatial modelling in relation to synoptic (spatio-temporal) data derived from a local, high-resolution hydrodynamic model. Small-scale changes in local currents reflecting upwelling driven by the interaction of the semi-diurnal tidal currents with the steep slopes of the bank were the Main habitat driver identified from the acoustic as well as the survey data. Spatial modelling based on selected key predictor variables showed the distribution of harbour porpoises to alternate between 2 upwelling cells depending on the direction of tidal currents. The size of upwelling cells was less than 10 km, matching the small-scale spatial structure of survey data as revealed by geostatistical analysis. The findings may have great implications for the design of future protected areas for harbour porpoises, and they indicate that the overlap between areas of concentration of the species and areas targeted by fisheries and the offshore wind industry could be avoided without major changes to current management practices.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,21,0,25,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"DHI Water Environm Hlth, DK-2970 Horsholm, DenmarkBiol Landschaftsokol Arbeitsgemeinschaft, D-20097 Hamburg, Germany",Biol Landschaftsokol Arbeitsgemeinschaft,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000262731000014,,

The application of Al- and Zn-based galvanic anodes as corrosion protection results in the continuous emission of inorganic matter (e.g. >80 kg Al-anode material per monopile foundation and year) into the marine environment. To identify tracers for emissions from offshore wind structures, anode materials (Al-based and Zn-based) were characterized for their elemental and isotopic composition. An acid digestion and analysis method for Al and Zn alloys was adapted and validated using the alloy CRMs ERM (R)-EB317 (AlZn6CuMgZr) and ERM (R)-EB602 (ZnAl4Cu1). Digests were measured for their elemental composition by ICP-MS/MS and for their Pb isotope ratios by MC ICP-MS. Ga and In were identified as potential tracers. Moreover, a combined tracer approach of the elements Al, Zn, Ga, Cd, In and Pb together with Pb isotope ratios is suggested fora reliable identification of offshore-wind-farm-induced emissions. In the Al anodes, the mass fractions were found to be >94.4% of Al, >26200 mg kg(-1) of Zn, >78.5 mg kg(-1) of Ga, >0.255 mg kg(-1) of Cd, >143 mg kg(-1) of In and >6.7 mg kg(-1) of Pb.

Even though avoidance and mitigation measures could benefit from a better knowledge of the species' migratory habits, we lack basic information about what habitats and corridors bats use during migration. We studied the isotopic niche dimensions of three bat species that are frequently killed at wind turbines in Germany: non-migratory Pipistrellus pipistrellus, mid-distance migratory Nyctalus noctula, and long-distance migratory Pipistrellus nathusii. We measured stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (delta C-13, delta N-15) in five tissues that differed in isotopic retention time (fur, wing membrane tissue, muscle, liver, blood) to shed light on the species-specific habitat use during the autumn migration period using standard ellipse areas (SEA(c)). Further, we used stable isotope ratios of non-exchangeable hydrogen (delta H-2(K)) in fur keratin to assess the breeding origin of bats. We inferred from isotopic composition (delta C-13, delta N-15) of fur keratin that isotopic niche dimensions of P. nathusii was distinct from that of N. noctula and P. pipistrellus, probably because P. nathusii was using more aquatic habitats than the other two species. Isoscape origin models supported that traveled distances before dying at wind turbines was largest for P. nathusii, intermediate for N. noctula, and shortest for P. pipistrellus. Isotopic niche dimensions calculated for each sample type separately reflected the species' migratory behavior. Pipistrellus pipistrellus and N. noctula showed similar isotopic niche breadth across all tissue types, whereas SEA(c) values of P. nathusii increased in tissues with slow turnaround time. Isotopic data suggested that P. nathusii consistently used aquatic habitats throughout the autumn period, whereas N. noctula showed a stronger association with terrestrial habitats during autumn compared to the pre-migration period.",,,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,27,0,34,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, Alfred Kowalke Str 17, D-10315 Berlin, GermanyUniv Halle Wittenberg, Cent Repository Nat Sci Collect, Dompl 4, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany",,,,2016-04-01,WOS:000374840500010,27411249,

Usually non indigenous species (NIS) are abundant in harbors. This is caused in part because of the higher propagule delivery rate in these areas. An alternative explanation of why invasion is enhanced in harbor and marinas is that environmental degradation commonly found in these habitats favors the establishment of NIS. Most surveys for introduced species were not comprehensive and targeted mainly ports and marinas. Angra dos Reis is an excellent system that provides an opportunity to compare the potential distribution of introduced and native species of Ascidiacea between port and natural environments. Here, we compared the colonization of experimental subtidal plates placed in harbors and marinas with the colonization of plates placed in nearby natural areas. With 27 taxa (15 identified to species), species richness was greater in port environments (25 versus 8). Six taxa were common to both environments while 19 taxa were exclusively found in ports. Among the identified species in ports, three were introduced, five were cryptogenic and only one was native. Only three species were found exclusively in the natural sites and all were cryptogenic. The presence of introduced species only in the port areas of Angra dos Reis reinforces the need for continued, periodic monitoring in the region for early detection of new, potentially invasive, species as well as for better understanding of abnormal population growth of the already known species.

This paper presents a series of laboratory- and field-based experiments that collectively aimed to elucidate biotic and abiotic factors that influence re-establishment success of biofouling organisms and fragmented colonial organisms defouled to the seabed. Reattachment success of colonial organisms experimentally fragmented was found to be species specific and dependent on fragment size. In both laboratory and field trials, some colonial ascidians had consistently greater reattachment success for larger size classes of fragments, while other encrusting and erect taxa showed poor reattachment capabilities. This study also revealed that sedimentation and turbidity are likely to have a strong influence on the survivorship of defouled material. Furthermore, for both high and low sedimentary environments, survivorship was found to be greater where predators were excluded. Despite risks posed by non-indigenous species (NIS), it is proposed that in-water defouling may be an appropriate management response in situations where a do nothing approach is potentially more detrimental. Moreover, results from this study suggest that environmental risks associated with defouling may be mitigated through appropriate defouling strategies (e.g., defouling location, frequency and method). In order to increase our predictive abilities for NIS establishment success resulting from in-water defouling, future studies should aim to further elucidate the relative importance of factors affecting survivorship of defouled material at locations where defouling is routinely undertaken.

As the majority of the capital investment in offshore wind is in the form of infrastructure and operation and maintenance costs, reducing these expenditures could greatly reduce the cost of energy (COE) for an offshore wind project. Sandia National Laboratory and its partners (TU Delft, University of Maine, Iowa State, and TPI Composites) believe that vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) offer multiple advantages over other rotor configurations considering this new COE breakdown. The unique arrangement of a VAWT allows the heavy generator and related components to be located at the base of the tower as opposed to the top, as is typical of a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT). This configuration lowers the topside CG which reduces the platform stability requirements, leading to smaller and cheaper platforms. Additionally this locates high maintenance systems close to the ocean surface thus increasing maintainability. To support this project and the general wind research community, the Offshore Wind ENergy Simulation (OWENS) toolkit is being developed in conjunction with Texas A&M as an open source, modular aero-elastic analysis code with the capability to analyze floating VAWTS. The OWENS toolkit aims to establish a robust and flexible -finite element framework and VAWT mesh generation utility, coupled with a modular interface that allows users to integrate easily with existing codes, such as aerodynamic and hydrodynamic codes.Current efforts to include a hydrodynamic module are focused on coupling WavEC2Wire with OWENS. WavEC2Wire is a wave-to-wire numerical model developed by Marco Alves at the Insituto Superior Tecnico for the analysis of wave energy converter devices. It has been adapted from its original form and restructured for use as a hydrodynamic module capable of providing OWENS with necessary floating platform dynamics. Hence, WavEC2Wire functions as a rigid-body solver designed to calculate the platform motion due to wave loads, moorings, and the influence of the attached VAWT and tower. This paper presents the WavEC2Wire module and details the OWENS coupling method. Additionally, planned improvements in the WavEC2Wire module as well as future development in OWENS are presented.",,,,,"33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 08-13, 2014JUN 08-13, 2014","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn Div","San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4554-7,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maine, Orono, ME 04469 USASandia Natl Labs, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USATexas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX USAWave Energy Ctr, Lisbon, Portugal",Wave Energy Ctr,,,2015-11-18,WOS:000363499100027,,

A case study in 2006 and 2007 at Cape Fragnet near Fecamp (Atlantic sea coast in NW France). A project to set up a wind farm in the French territory should take into consideration the risks the latter may pose to the avifauna, and this all the more so when it is situated in a priority area, a so-called ZPS. Once this park is fully operating, a pertinent thing to do is to verify whether the sensed risks are factual or not. Cap Fagnet is situated on a major postnuptial migratory route used by the Nordic passerines. The observation of the birds' behaviour when they are migrating during the day has revealed that the main flow of these migratory birds always positioned itself facing the park. The birds never anticipated the presence of the windmills, in spite of the fact that the latter were visible from a great distance. Their disoriented trajectories mean that the blades' movements are only perceived upon arrival at the park. When the machines are running, almost all the birds will clearly deviate from their itinerary and fly around the park; when they are stopped, half of them will cross the park. The search for possible dead birds lying next to the windmills has led us to devise simple and efficient procedures that are easily applicable to other parks. Only three bodies of dead birds belonging to different species were discovered, two of them being mainly nocturnal migratory birds. Considering the great number of birds passing through, their mortality rates in this park appear to be relatively low. However, should the number of wind farms constructed along narrow migratory routes increase, birds flying around them will suffer added stress and consumption of reserves. The accumulation of these hazards may compromise the full completion of their migration. Therefore impact studies should take account of all the projects situated along each particular migratory path.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0002-4619,,,,,,,,,,,"Grp Ornithol Normand, 181 Rue Auge, F-14000 Caen, France",,,,2010-01-01,BCI:BCI201000606000,,

Specific topics covered include a short history of Arctic seabird management, the importance of open access data for seabird research and management, attraction of seabirds to and pollution from ships and oil platforms, potential impacts of oil spills, and the question of who will and should manage Arctic seabird populations effectively. A global overview of seabirds as indicators while baselines are shifting and trophic cascades occur in the ocean is provided (authored by Eric Woehler).

The in situ winds from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys, R/V Polarstern, Aurora Australis, Roger Revelle and PY30-1 oil platform, were converted to the 10 m equivalent neutral winds. The temporal and spatial differences between the HY-2A SCAT and the in situ observations were limited to less than 5 min and 12.5 km. For HY-2A SCAT wind speed products, the comparison and analysis using the NDBC buoys yield a bias of -0.49 m/s, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.3 m/s and an increase negative bias with increasing wind speed observation above 3m/s. Although less accurate of HY-2A SCAT wind direction at low winds, the RMSE of 19.19A degrees with a bias of 0.92A degrees is found for wind speeds higher than 3 m/s. These results are found consistent with those from R/Vs and oil platform comparisons. Moreover, the NDBC buoy comparison results also suggest that the accuracy of HY-2A SCAT winds is consistent over the first half year of 2012.

In the present study, we define the social structure and male typical behavior of rock hind (Epinephelus adscensionis) in the wild. In addition, we detail the captive conditions and time period necessary to induce the onset of the sex-specific coloration and sexual change. At six oil production platform locations in the Gulf of Mexico, rock hind social group size and typical male rock hind social behavior were documented. We observed a rapid temporary color display in rock hind that could be turned on and off within three seconds and was used for confronting territory intruders and displays of aggression towards females. The male-specific tuxedo pattern consists of a bright yellow tail, a body with alternating dark brown and white patches and a dark bar extending from the upper mandible to the operculum. Identification and size ranges of male, female and intersex fish collected from oil platforms were determined in conjunction with gonadal histology. Rock hind social order is haremic with one dominant male defending a territory and a linear dominance hierarchy among individuals. In five captive experiments, the largest remaining female rock hind displayed the male specific color pattern within 32d after dominant male removal from the social group. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence in a grouper species of color patterning used to display territoriality and dominance outside of spawning aggregations.

There is an increasing interest in articulating the added values of the creation of artificial hard bottom habitats through the construction of offshore renewable energy devices, for the benefit of fisheries management and conservation. The Lysekil Project is a test park for wave power located about 100 km north of Gothenburg at the Swedish west coast. A wave energy device consists of a linear wave power generator attached to a foundation on the seabed, and connected by a wire to a buoy at the surface. Our field experiment examined the function of wave energy foundations as artificial reefs. In addition, potentials for enhancing the abundance of associated fish and crustaceans through manufactured holes of the foundations were also investigated. Assemblages of mobile organisms were examined by visual censuses in July and August 2007, 3 months after deployment of the foundations. Results generally show low densities of mobile organisms, but a significantly higher abundance of fish and crabs on the foundations compared to surrounding soft bottoms. Further, while fish numbers were not influenced by increased habitat complexity (holes), it had a significantly positive effect on quantities of edible crab (Cancer pagurus), on average leading to an almost five-fold increase in densities of this species. Densities of spiny starfish (Marthasterias glacialis) were negatively affected by the presence of holes, potentially due to increased predator abundance (e.g. C pagurus). These results suggest a species-specific response to enhanced habitat complexity. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To test this hypothesis, we monitored the acoustic activity of two captive harbour porpoises held in a net pen continuously during a full year and fed by their human keepers during daylight hours, thus removing the influence of prey activity. The porpoises were exposed to similar temperature and ambient light conditions as free-ranging animals living in the same region.

The Ocean SAMP applies the inclusive, ecosystem-based approach to marine spatial planning recommended by the National Ocean Commission in 2004 that is a feature of the National Ocean Policy promulgated in 2010. It places within a larger spatial planning context the impact assessment process that is the basis for the issuance of leases and permits requested by a developer for a specified activity at a defined marine site. The Ocean SAMP was prepared over a two and a half year period of information generation, analysis, consultation, planning and policy making prompted by the need to identify potentially suitable sites for anticipated offshore wind farms. Its highly consultative approach builds upon the 30 years of experience of the Rhode Island Coastal Program in developing and implementing special area management plans (SAMPs) for coastal and marine areas where conflicts over needs for both development and conservation demand special attention and negotiation among stakeholders with different interests.

This combined wind-solar-aquaculture (WSA) system is intended to utilize the ocean space and water resources more effectively and more economically, while greatly shortening the payback period of investment in offshore power generation. The details of this WSA design are described, showing that a square-shaped fishing cage serves as a floating foundation for the 7600 m(2) solar array and four multi MW VAWTs. The WAMIT program based on potential-flow theory is employed to obtain the WSA's motion response amplitude operators (RAOs) in sinusoidal waves of varying periods. The motion RAOs indicated that the proposed concept possesses better hydrodynamic seakeeping performances than its OC3Hywind spar and OC4DeepCwind semi-submersible counterparts. A potential site located in the northwest South China Sea is selected to deploy the WSA. Its feasibility is then examined in terms of the hydrodynamic motions and structural dynamic response driven by wind, waves, and current. Fully coupled time-domain simulations are carried out for 50-year survival conditions. The whole structure exhibits outstanding performance for its small motions in random wind and seas. Moreover, under these survival conditions, the top accelerations and tower base stresses of the VAWTs and mooring line tensions readily meet the design requirements. Technically, the WSA has strong competitiveness and wide prospects in the offshore industry for both power exploitation and marine aquaculture in intermediate and deep waters.",,,,,,,,,31,1,0,0,2,0,32,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Tsinghua Univ, Shenzhen Int Grad Sch, Div Ocean Sci & Technol, Shenzhen 518005, Peoples R ChinaTsinghua Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R ChinaPowerchina Huadong Engn Corp Ltd, Hangzhou 311122, Peoples R China",,,,2020-04-16,WOS:000522489000097,,

It is also one of the RES which has become economically affordable much before several other RESs have. As a result, next to biomass (and excluding large hydro), wind energy is the RES being most extensively tapped by the world at present. Despite carrying the drawback of intermittency, wind energy has found favor due to its perceived twin virtues of relatively lesser production cost and environment-friendliness.But with increasing use of turbines for harnessing wind energy, the adverse environmental impacts of this RES are increasingly coming to light. The present paper summarizes the current understanding of these impacts and assesses the challenges they are posing. One among the major hurdles has been the NYMBI (not in my backyard) syndrome due to which there is increasing emphasis on installing windfarms several kilometers offshore. But such moves have serious implications for marine life which is already under great stress due to impacts of overfishing, marine pollution, global warming, ozone hole and ocean acidification. Evidence is also emerging that the adverse impacts of wind power plants on wildlife, especially birds and bats, are likely to be much greater than is reflected in the hitherto reported figures of individuals killed per turbine. Likewise recent findings on the impact of noise and flicker generated by the wind turbines indicate that these can have traumatic impacts on individuals who have certain predispositions. But the greatest of emerging concerns is the likely impact of large wind farms on the weather, and possibly the climate. The prospects of wind energy are discussed in the backdrop of these and other rising environmental concerns. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The validation exercise demonstrated that the height of birds in flight could be measured using LiDAR to an accuracy of within 1 m. This compares very favourably to other approaches used for measure seabird flight height. We successfully collected flight height information on 2,201 birds of which 806 were believed to be black-legged kittiwakes and 377 were identified as northern gannets.

Existing collision-risk models take into account parameters of wind turbines and bird flight behavior to estimate collision probability and mortality rates. Two behavioral characteristics these models require are the proportion of birds flying at the height of the rotor swept-zone and the flight speed of birds passing through the rotor swept-zone. In recent studies, investigators have measured flight height and flight speed of migrating birds using fixed-beam radar and thermal imaging. These techniques work well for fixed areas where migrants commonly pass over, but they cannot readily provide species-specific information. We measured flight heights of a nesting shorebird, the federally threatened Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus), using optical range finding and measured flight speed using videography. Several single-turbine wind projects have been proposed for the Atlantic coast of the United States where they may pose a potential threat to these plovers. We studied Piping Plovers in New Jersey and Massachusetts during the breeding seasons of 2012 and 2013. Measured flight heights ranged from 0.7 to 10.5 m with a mean of 2.6 m (N = 19). Concurrent visually estimated flight heights were all within 2 m of measured heights and most within 1 m. In separate surveys, average visually estimated flight height was 2.6 m (N = 1674) and ranged from 0.25 m to 40 m. Average calculated flight speed was 9.30 m/s (N = 17). Optical range finding was challenging, but provided a useful way to calibrate visual estimates where frames of reference were lacking in the environment.

In view of this complete dependence upon fossil fuels, investigations into the prospects of diversifying electrical generation by resorting to renewable energy technologies are particularly relevant. The archipelago has peculiar characteristics such as high population density, comparatively deep coastal waters and an economy based on tourism, manufacturing, marine-sector activities and services that make the integration of wind power generation projects challenging. Local government authorities commissioned the authors to assess the constraints related to wind farm development in a shallow water coastal area, known as is-Sikka l-Bajda, which could present a wind potential worth exploiting, and to recommend adequate mitigation measures to minimize any impacts and conflicts with stakeholders. These constraints include marine navigational aspects, fishing and aquaculture, tourism and other site-specific activities. Environmental constraints exist including the fact that the site is characterized by extensive seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) meadows, that it is a priority habitat under the EU Habitats Directive, and that the site itself is a reef-another priority habitat within the same directive. The proposed near-shore site is also in the vicinity of a protected coastal bird rafting and bird nesting site for the Yelkouan Shearwater species. Submarine noise generation-particularly during the construction phase -is also of concern in view of the regular sighting of marine mammals in Maltese coastal waters. In the site evaluation exercise, another secondary site in the Maltese Islands, located off the north Gozo coast, was also assessed. Mitigation measures specific to the Sikka l-Bajda site proposed by the authors include the deployment of silt curtains, bubble screens and unobtrusive turbine lighting devices and avoiding utilisation of the reef area closest to the protected bird colony. Such measures also relate to the choice of the array design to minimise visual impact and to the period of the year when wind plant construction and deployment should take place to minimize impact on avifaunal populations. By declaring the marine area contiguous to the proposed nearshore wind facility development as off-limits to fishing vessels, a de facto 'No-take' Marine Protected Area can also be effectively instituted. One also expects submerged components of the nearshore wind facility to be colonized within a brief period by a diverse fouling community and that the same components act as Fish Aggregating Devices (FAD's), greatly enhancing fish populations in the area. In view of the current paucity in Mediterranean nearshore wind power facilities, the proposed project could potentially serve as a pilot project for the whole region, and also become a tourist attraction.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,0309-524X,2048-402X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Malta, Inst Sustainable Energy, Triq Il Barrakki, Marsaxlokk MXK 1531, MaltaUniv Malta, Phys Oceanog Unit, Msida, MaltaToday Publ Policy Inst, Chamber Commerce & Enterprise, Valletta, MaltaUniv Malta, Dept Phys, Msida, MaltaUniv Malta, Inst Sustainable Energy, Marsaxlokk, Malta",Today Publ Policy Inst,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000210773300005,,

The first benthic settlement was collected in an area characterized by homogeneous depth and grain size composition (case study A) around an off-shore gas platform, while the second one was collected along a coast-wide transect in an area with human pressure limited to fishing activities (case study B). Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis was used to assess differences in the taxonomic structure of benthic assemblages and to test TS on the two different datasets. TS seems to work in both sites, from species to higher taxonomic levels, and the family taxonomic level appears the best compromise for taxonomic resolution when an accurate identification is not achievable. The application of TS does not indicate a significant difference between the two datasets and appears therefore to be a valid instrument to analyse and describe the structure of benthic settlements in the case of taxonomically complex communities.",,,,,,,,,27,2,0,0,26,1,33,,,0173-9565,1439-0485,,,,,,,,,,"ISPRA, Cent Inst Marine Res, Rome, Italy",,,,2009-10-01,WOS:000270237100002,,

Wind generated power is obviously subject to fluctuations due to variation in the wind. There is also a shutdown mechanism which is employed when the wind becomes very strong which prevents damage to the turbines. Thus, when the wind is light or very strong, there is no power generated. Predicting the output from the turbines is currently an important research topic.In the past, time series analysis and other methods have been employed in order to better understand the nature of the data. These include ARMA and GARCH models as well as relatively new methods of detrended fluctuation analysis, (Ward et al., 2009; Boland et al., 2009; Magnano and Boland, 2007; Kavasseri and Nagarajan, 2004). The behaviour of complex time series, as is the wind farm power output, and as is seen in the financial sector has been and is currently well researched. Some of these time series have been found to be non-linear, stochastic and chaotic, and are notoriously difficult to model. There is evidence however, that there could be some scaling behaviour apparent in these series (Weron and Przybylowicz, 2000).The particular objective of this project is to reduce the error in predicting the power supply generated by wind farms (or the individual turbines) five minutes into the future so that the power company is able to guarantee the promised power. Currently this is not possible due to the financial risks involved in not delivering the guaranteed amount. Apart from climatic research, there is not much in the way of research into spatial correlations where records are available of similar variables at different locations. Since the temporal nature of the time series is currently being thoroughly investigated by many researchers, this study explores the possible spatial correlations between wind farms.This paper describes the investigation into the spatial correlation between five South Australian wind farms using empirical orthogonal function analysis, (EOF). If there is spatial correlation between farms, this can be used to better predict what might happen at one farm based upon what has happened at a different farm at some earlier time. There has also been speculation among experts that power output of sites along a weather front behave in a similar way.One of the main difficulties with determining the power output of wind turbines is that wind speed is not a useful predictor. The wind speed isn't actually measured at the height of the blades and if instruments were installed the to measure the wind speed immediately in front of the turbine blades, then the likelihood of correct measurements would be compromised by their existence.This study has focused on the spatial correlations between farms and the initial results from this study indicate that there is evidence of some spatial correlation between some of the farms.",,,,,MSSANZ 19th Biennial Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)MSSANZ 19th Biennial Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM),"DEC 12-16, 2011DEC 12-16, 2011","CSIRO; Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol; Per Convent & Exhibit Ctr; Perth Convent Bur; Curtin Univ; Australian Math Soc; Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math; Australian Math Sci Inst; Maralte Publishers; Econ Soc Australian; HEMA Consulting; Simulat Australia; Stat Soc Australia Inc; Modelling & Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand Inc; Int Assoc Math & Comp SimulatCSIRO; Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol; Per Convent & Exhibit Ctr; Perth Convent Bur; Curtin Univ; Australian Math Soc; Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math; Australian Math Sci Inst; Maralte Publishers; Econ Soc Australian; HEMA Consulting; Simulat Australia; Stat Soc Australia Inc; Modelling & Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand Inc; Int Assoc Math & Comp Simulat","Perth, AUSTRALIAPerth, AUSTRALIA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-9872143-1-7,,,,,,,,,"RMIT Univ, Sch Math & Geospatial Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000314989302026,,

This work has been undertaken on behalf of The Offshore Wind Strategic Monitoring Research Forum (OWSMRF) (https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/owsmrf/). OWSMRF is an industry-led collaborative forum that aims to identify and develop research to fill critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of the impact of offshore wind development on the marine environment. OWSMRF stakeholders identified cumulative impacts on kittiwakes as the priority need for improving understanding of offshore windfarm environmental impacts. Improving understanding of collision-induced mortality was identified as one of the key knowledge gaps in this area. JNCC has collaborated with experts in this field to provide a summary of potential research which might help to reduce uncertainty in estimates of collision-induced mortality. This report provides a summary of existing relevant research and evidence, and research opportunities that have been identified to help reduce the uncertainty. The research opportunities (ROs) suggested as potentially very useful and presented in this report are: RO1.1: strategic collision monitoring project; deploying turbine monitoring systems (likely to be primarily camera-based system such as DTBird, WTBird or similar) across a range of turbines and windfarms to collect empirical data on kittiwake collision rates. This would allow validation of CRM approach and empirical cumulative effects assessment. This project would need to be undertaken in stages: RO1.1a updated review of technology to detect collisions with turbines (as in Dirksen et al. 2017). This may need to include a field test if promising technology has not yet been deployed in offshore situation. RO1.1b power analysis and strategic framework for deployment of monitoring systems. RO1.1a and R01.1b combined would maximise the value of such data collected across windfarms. RO1.1c deployment of systems across a range of turbines and windfarms to collect empirical kittiwake collision data. RO1.2: coordinated strategic GPS tracking programme across multiple colonies. This would include accelerometer deployment. Such a coordinated programme would improve understanding of spatial and temporal patterns in distributions and behaviour in and around windfarm, and how this evolves over the course of a consent: pre, during and post construction. RO1.3: concurrent collection of flight height data using multiple sensors. This would improve understanding of accuracies, biases, and comparability of flight height information collected by a variety of different methods. This would inform accuracy of various available flightheight data to improve precision in resulting collision risk estimates. Further research opportunities that could reduce uncertainty in estimates of kittiwake mortality at windfarms are described briefly: - RO1.4: analysis of existing GPS tracking data to understand variation in risk across turbines. - RO1.5: analysis of pre and post construction density data to inform macro-avoidance, and how windfarm design might influence this. - RO1.6: analysis of pre and post construction GPS data to understand if/how kittiwakes alter behaviour in response to windfarms. - RO1.7: assessing whether kittiwakes respond to changing wind conditions (turbine wake effect) within windfarms. - RO1.8: tagging of juvenile birds to compare their collision risk to that of adults. - RO1.9: GPS tracking to complement EOWDC bird avoidance study; providing bird movements over a broader spatial scale for comparison with EOWDC data collected within a functioning windfarm. - RO1.10: strategic LiDAR survey to provide flight height information at a broad spatial scale, to inform kittiwake sensitivity mapping. - RO1.11: simulation study to assess how accurately transect-based density estimates capture flux through a windfarm. - RO1.12: strategic (non-GPS) tracking study, as described in Black and Ruffino (2019), using a combination of VHF radio tags, PIT tags and colour ringing, deployed as to maximise the ability to obtain survival rates of kittiwakes which interact with windfarms versus those not interacting with windfarms. Each RO alone could lead to improvements in understanding of cumulative collision risk across windfarms, and the degree to which uncertainty is reduced is likely to increase as more ROs are undertaken. Undertaking a carefully selected, complementary selection of these ROs could significantly reduce uncertainty in assessments of cumulative mortality of kittiwake from offshore windfarm deployment.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15709060090,,

We demonstrate that these processes are hampered severely, primarily because ambiguities in the legislation and lack of clear implementation guidance are such that they do not ensure robust assessment of the significance of impacts and cumulative effects. We highlight why the regulatory framework leads to conceptual ambiguities and propose changes which, for the most part, do not require major adjustments to standard practice. We emphasize the importance of determining the degree of confidence in impacts to permit the likelihood as well as magnitude of impacts to be quantified and propose ways in which assessment of population-level impacts could be incorporated into the EIA process.

Generally, the quantification of microfauna indicator taxa related well to the gradient of contamination on the seafloor. Contrary to eukaryotic Euplotida, metabarcoding data and qPCR numbers for indicative prokaryotic taxa showed the same relationship to offshore contaminants (both showed positive relationship). We found absolute numbers of SSU rRNA gene copies of (1) Dinophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and Alcanivorax were correlated with the level of petroleum-related compounds but not with other environmental variables, (2) bacteria closely related to Shewanella were correlated with the concentration of Ba, PAH, as well to percent of gravel, (3) Desulfobacteriales correlated with petroleum-related contaminants, but as well with percent of gravel and grain size.Findings from our study suggest that biomonitoring surveys of O&G activities on benthos could benefit from quantification of specific micro-fauna indicators that is simpler and faster than the methods currently used for impact assessment of benthos.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,6,0,6,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,,,,,,,"NORCE, Norwegian Res Ctr, Environm, Mekjarvik 12, N-4070 Randaberg, Norway",,,,2020-09-20,WOS:000542088100014,32497879,

Similar to the PR of C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the PR of X-band SAR data also shows significant dependence on incidence angle. The normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) in VV polarization data is generally larger than that in HH polarization for incidence angles above 23 degrees. Based on the analysis, two PR models proposed for C-band SAR were retuned using TS-X dual-polarization data. A new PR model, called X-PR hereafter, is proposed as well to convert the NRCS of TS-X in HH polarization to that in VV polarization. By using the developed geophysical model functions of XMOD1 and XMOD2 and the tuned PR models, the sea surface field is retrieved from the TS-X data in HH polarization. The comparisons with in situ buoy measurements show that the combination of XMOD2 and X-PR models yields a good retrieval with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.03 m s(-1) and scatter index (SI) of 22.4%. A further comparison with a high-resolution analysis wind model in the North Sea is also presented, which shows better agreement with RMSE of 1.76 m s(-1) and SI of 20.3%. We also find that the difference between the fitting of the X-PR model and the PR derived from TS-X dual-polarization data is close to a constant. By adding the constant to the X-PR model, the accuracy of HH polarization sea surface wind speed is further improved with the bias reduced by 0.3 m s(-1).

This presents a challenge when combining data from these different tracking systems to obtain larger sample sizes or to compare habitat use over time. In this study, we used a Bayesian state-space modelling approach to integrate tracking data from multiple tag types and standardise position estimates while accounting for location error. Harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) telemetry data for the Moray Firth, Scotland, were collated from three tag types: VHF, Argos satellite and GPS GSM. Tags were deployed on 37 seals during 1989 to 2009 resulting in 37 tracks with a total of 2886 tracking days and a mean duration of 87 days per track. A state-space model was applied to all of the raw tracks to provide daily position estimates and a measure of the uncertainty for each position. We used this standardised tracking dataset to model their habitat use and preference, which was then scaled by the population size estimated from haul-out counts to give an estimate of the absolute number of harbour seals using different parts of the Moray Firth. As expected for a central place forager, harbour seals most frequently occurred in areas close to their inshore haul-out sites. However, our analyses also demonstrated consistent use of offshore foraging grounds, typically within 30 km of haul-out sites in waters <50 m deep. The use of these statistical models to integrate and compare different datasets is especially important for assessing longer-term responses to environmental variation and anthropogenic activities, allowing management advice to be based upon datasets that integrate information from all available tracking technologies.

Given the complexity of these systems, the interactions between the structure and incident hydro-aerodynamic forces need to be well understood. While numerous solutions are being explored, an optimal design is yet to be established within the industry.This study explores the effects of tendon inclination on the dynamic behaviour of a 10MW tension-leg platform (TLP) floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT), and the interaction of different design solutions with higher-order hydrodynamic loading. The model was subject to an extreme sea state in order to capture second and third-order wave effects, and the nonlinear waves were generated via the high-order spectral (HOS) method. The analysis was performed using the hydrodynamic engineering tool CALHYPSO, in-house developed by EDF Lab.Second and third order inertial hydrodynamic loads were included in the time-domain simulations in order to capture low frequency loads and ringing effects respectively. Results show that difference-frequency second order effects have a negligible impact on motions and tendon tensions of the analysed floating wind turbine model, while third order terms can significantly enhance the dynamic response of the system to extreme incident waves. While inclined-leg floater configurations presented improved motion and tendon tension responses under linear loading, the inclusion of quadratic and triple-frequency contributions showed that tendon inclination can in fact increase tension variations in the mooring lines when subject to extreme wave climates. This can lead to slacking in the mooring lines being observed more frequently in inclined-leg configurations. The results therefore suggest that neglecting third order effects, as commonly done in industry, can lead to significant underestimations of motion and tendon tension responses of tension-leg platform wind turbines.",,,,,"38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)","JUN 09-14, 2019JUN 09-14, 2019","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine EngnASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn","Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLANDUniv Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLAND",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,2153-4772,,978-0-7918-5889-9,,,,,,,,,"Univ Edinburgh, IDCORE, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandEDF Lab Chatou, Paris, FranceEDF Lab Paris Saclay, Paris, FranceUniv Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Strathclyde, Glasgow, Lanark, ScotlandUniv Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England",EDF Lab ChatouEDF Lab Paris Saclay,,,2020-03-10,WOS:000513310000076,,

Along with its accompanying Open File Report (OFR), this comprehensive database can be used (and modified or updated) to quantify marine bird vulnerability to OWEIs in the CCS at the population level. For 81 marine bird species present in the CCS, we generated numeric scores to represent vulnerability of collision and displacement associated with potential OWEI. The metrics used to produce these scores includes global population size, proportion of the population in the CCS, threat status, adult survival, breeding and feeding score, annual occurrence in the CCS, nocturnal and diurnal flight activity, macro-avoidance behavior, flight height, and habitat flexibility can be updated and adjusted as new data become available. The scoring methodology was peer-reviewed to evaluate if the metrics identified and the values generated were appropriate for each species considered.

Analysis of field and museum Climactichnites, together with experiments on the preservation of similar modern trails, indicates that the tracemaker was an elongate, bilaterally symmetrical, dorsoventrally flattened, soft-bodied animal with a muscular foot. These characteristics are consistent with the tracemaker being a primitive mollusc or mollusc-like animal. Unlike most Neoproterozoic and Cambrian molluscs, the tracemaker could reach considerable size; at up to c. 69 cm long, it was one of the largest Cambrian animals of its time. When moving on the sediment surface, locomotion resulted from muscular waves generated along the sole of its flexible foot; the foot was extended and then clamped onto the substrate. Contraction of pedal muscles then pulled the body forward. Sedimentary structures associated with Climactichnites wilsoni, such as polygonal desiccation cracks, raindrop impressions, adhesion structures and gas escape structures demonstrate that the animal inhabited intermittently subaerially exposed environments. The tracemaker's method of locomotion is similar to that employed by modern intertidal gastropods, which make Climactichnites-like trails on exposed sand flats. However, these modern trails are not preserved because of erosion by wind, waves, tides and subsequent bioturbation. Abundant microbial sedimentary structures are associated with C. wilsoni, and together with low levels of vertical bioturbation, intimate that microbial binding may have mediated the preservation of these early mollusc trails.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,14,0,17,,,0031-0239,1475-4983,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Connecticut, Ctr Integrat Geosci, Storrs, CT 06269 USAAmherst Coll, Dept Geol, Amherst, MA 01002 USA",,,,2009-07-01,WOS:000268060800006,,

The ecosystem-based planning and management approach has developed over the past decades with the goal of reducing this threat by defining planning and management of uses in a way that mitigates negative effects on ecosystem structure and function. For oceans and coasts, marine spatial planning (MSP) can further aid the implementation of ecosystem based management, a widely accepted tenet of planning for the marine environment. It can do so by allocating different uses of space in a way that reduces conflicts for the benefit of the environment. Here, we propose an approach to MSP that incorporates principles of reconciliation ecology for the planning of marine (nearshore) enclosures. The approach supports conservation within and around anthropogenic elements outside of marine protected areas. Since human activity typically involves some damage to natural ecosystem, this research contributes by proposing a way to incorporate ecosystem modeling for MSP that includes human activity. Examining areas of human activity under different management scenarios allows identification of possible trends in human-natural ecosystem interactions. Using such an approach increases marine conservation opportunities, and directs educated and cautious MSP in ways that allow implementation of an ecosystem-based approach.",,,,,Symposium on Ecological Engineering in the Coastal Seascape at 5th International EcoSummitSymposium on Ecological Engineering in the Coastal Seascape at 5th International EcoSummit,"AUG 29-SEP 01, 2016AUG 29-SEP 01, 2016",,"Montpellier, FRANCEMontpellier, FRANCE",4,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,,,,,,,"Technion, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Sego Bldg, IL-32000 Haifa, IsraelTechnion, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Haifa, Israel",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000444614500063,,

However, very little scientific information about YFT in the region exists in general and in particular about its movements and migrations, except information from limited tag/recapture studies that indicates that juveniles move great distances and mix with the large Eastern Atlantic populations. Until recently, YFT was probably viewed by most fisheries scientists as a highly migratory species that is caught by fishermen at various places along the species' large-scale, oceanic migratory routes. Recently, however, independent acoustic tagging and telemetry studies of YFT in three different locations and environments have shown a previously unknown, different pattern. YFT have been shown to exhibit continued long-term residence around seamounts in the Gulf of California, fish aggregating devices (FADs) in Hawaii, and deepwater petroleum structures in the Gulf of Mexico. The recent findings of protracted association of YFT with objects and features suggest that fisheries scientists and managers should view YFT in a new and different light.

Given the well-known consequences of excessive reliance on fossil energy sources, this study is concentrated on wind-powered hydrogen production by desalination of sea water and then subjecting the product to electrolysis. For this purpose, a coastal city was selected from each Iranian coastal province, and then the wind energy generation potential in these cities was evaluated by Weibull distribution function. The amount of energy to be generated by three commercially available wind turbines and the amount of desalinated water and hydrogen to be produced in each area were then evaluated. The results showed that the port of Anzali on the coast of the Caspian Sea has an average annual wind power density of 327 w/m(2), and thus enjoys the best wind energy generation potential among the studied coastal areas. The annual energy generation to be achieved by one EWT direct wind 52/900 turbine installed in this port was found to be 2315.53MWh, which is equivalent to 1804 tons of net annual CO2 emission reduction. The total energy output of the said turbine could be used to produce 439,950.7m(3) of treated water or 35,973.49 kg of hydrogen a year. Thus, a wind farm containing 55 of these turbines could provide enough power to produce the hydrogen needed to fuel all private cars in Anzali.",,,,,,,,,31,1,0,0,0,0,31,,,0958-305X,2048-4070,,,,,,,,,,"Yazd Univ, Ind Engn Dept, Yazd, IranUniv Georgia, Dept Comp, Athens, GA 30602 USA",,,,2018-05-22,WOS:000432060400002,,

Migration counts from points strategically located on the coast can be a reliable and effective method of reaching this goal. We propose a consistent and statistically robust method for estimating such numbers by generalized additive modeling of the numbers passing during periods when counts are interrupted. This procedure has the advantage of accounting for the effects of covariates, such as wind, on the counts in a flexible manner, potentially increasing accuracy and precision. We develop a reliable method of estimating precision, based on a parametric bootstrap, and applied a sensitivity analysis to our models to test their accuracy. We demonstrate the method with three species of seabirds migrating through the Strait of Gibraltar. Estimated numbers of the Northern Gannet (Morus bassanus) are similar to the estimated Atlantic population that winters in the western Mediterranean Sea, while for both Cory's (Calonectris diomedea) and Balearic (Puffinus mauretanicus) Shearwaters they are greater than the current population estimates. These results have important implications in conservation and highlight the necessity for reestimation of the latter two species' global population. Potential sources of biases include the constraint on detectability due to distance and the possibility of double counting due to local movements.

This area has also pioneered the development of offshore wind energy in North America. The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has established 9 Wind Energy Area (WEA) lease blocks along the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf in areas that may provide important staging and wintering habitat for scoters and other species of sea ducks. Concern over the potential impact of offshore wind energy on sea duck populations has led to efforts to develop models to understand their distribution, habitat use, and site fidelity. We used satellite telemetry to document winter phenology and site fidelity, as well as fine-scale resource selection and habitat use, of 40 White-winged Scoters along the southern New England continental shelf. Scoters spent over half of the annual cycle on the wintering grounds and demonstrated a high degree of interannual site fidelity to composite core-use areas. Sizes of individual 50% core-use home ranges were variable (X = 868 km(2); range: 32-4,220 km(2)) and individual 95% utilization distributions ranged widely (X = 4,388 km(2); range: 272-18,235 km(2)). More than half of all tagged birds occupied 2 or more discrete core-use areas that were up to 400 km apart. Throughout the study area, scoters selected areas with lower salinity, lower sea surface temperature, higher chlorophyll-a concentrations, and higher hard-bottom substrate probability. Resource selection function models classified 18,649 km(2) (23%) of the study area as high probability of use, which included or immediately bordered similar to 420 km(2) of proposed WEA lease blocks.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Using multibeam sonar to monitor animal behaviour and environmental interactions at marine renewable energy sites,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2020,2020,"To date, there are 8.5 GW of installed UK offshore wind capacity, and it is estimated 20% of current UK electricity demand could be met with wave and tidal stream sources. However, with rapid development of marine renewable energy (MRE) including wind, wave and tidal stream energy, uncertainty remains surrounding the environmental and ecological effects. Concerns include disruption of migratory and foraging animal behaviour, direct mortality from animal collision with underwater turbines, attraction of animals as a result of prey aggregation around structures, or displacement from preferred habitats. Changes in behaviour of fish species, in particular those which are common prey of seabirds and marine mammals, could lead to changes in foraging behaviour of their predators as observed at offshore wind turbines. A recent study found 1.75 times higher fish school (prey) passage rates at tidal turbine structures, and 5.66 times higher in low speed wakes [1]. However, key questions remain about whether these increases in prey abundance are reflected in changes in predator numbers or behaviour; understanding potential predator responses also has important consequences for collision risk with either above water (wind) or below water (tidal) turbine blades. Regulators need information on animal distribution, underwater behaviour and interactions with marine energy developments to inform licensing and management.Multibeam sonar mounted on seabed platforms has been demonstrated as a suitable method to investigate these knowledge gaps [2-4], providing continuous, fine-scale information on the behaviour, distribution and interactions of fish, diving seabirds and marine mammals, including predator-prey behaviour. This inter-disciplinary PhD will develop algorithms for multibeam sonar data processing for target detection, tracking and classification in high energy sites. The project will build on several existing datasets allowing investigation of the transferability of techniques and results between sites / devices / instruments. Analysis of the results will address key ecological and regulator questions on predator-prey interactions, animal behaviour, and biophysical coupling at MRE sites. The project will also develop recommendations for future data collection to ensure measurements can effectively meet monitoring requirements in collaboration with the project partner Marine Scotland Science. A robust and transferable suite of processing tools will address industry uncertainty and answer the crucial ecological questions on the environmental effects of MRE development. The student will be able to engage in future data collection opportunities to apply the techniques and recommendations.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2452463,,,,,,,,University of the Highlands and Islands,University of the Highlands and Islands,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15334561,,

This article discusses The Cooperative Participatory Evaluation of Renewable Technologies on Ecosystem Services (CORPORATES) research project, which developed an innovative and practical method of linking ecological processes, ecosystem services and benefits. The research was conducted in the context of licensing decisions for offshore wind farms in the North Sea (Scotland, UK).A set of linked, modular participatory processes were developed to foster cross-sector stakeholder engagement. It employed an exchange of ecological, legal, social, economic and cultural knowledge around marine ecosystem services. Workshop exercises included participatory mapping, benefit identification, and developing an understanding of linkages between ecosystem services, benefits, stakeholders' activities and policy drivers through co-development of conceptual systems maps of the study area.The participatory exercises fostered meaningful dialogue across sectors and an ability to participate equally, despite initial differences in knowledge about ecosystem services. The development of conceptual systems maps facilitated productive discussion about trade-offs in relation to different policies. Reflective discussion identifies ways in which the developed processes could be integrated into future decision making.An assessment of the approach revealed that it operationalised a post normal science framework in terms of process oversight, multiple knowledge claims, and managing uncertainty. It developed a process that linked understanding of ecosystem functioning with the creation and implementation of policy thereby creating an ecosystem approach to marine spatial planning and licensing decisions, as required by law.This approach has extensive transferability to situations where stakeholder engagement is required to develop policy and provide feedback as part of a decision-making process. It is an engagement, outreach tool for communities and can help teach methods and processes for stakeholder engagement which enable new insights.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,2212-0416,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aberdeen, Sch Law, Aberdeen AB24 3UB, ScotlandJames Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, ScotlandMarine Scotland, 375 Victoria Rd, Aberdeen AB11 9DB, ScotlandUniv York, Dept Environm & Geog, York YO10 5NG, N Yorkshire, EnglandUniv Aberdeen, Sch Geol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UF, ScotlandUniv Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 TZ, Scotland",,,,2020-08-07,WOS:000552657600005,,

Because siting bottom-mounted turbines in most nearshore coastal zones is either impractical or politically difficult, turbine developers are testing floating-platform turbine technologies for deeper waters. Deepwater, floating-platform turbines have the advantages of being sited in the highest quality winds farther offshore, movable if desired, and located beyond the horizon, out of sight from shore. This paper reports on conversations with 103 coastal stakeholders at community meetings regarding development and testing of floating turbines off the coast of Maine, U.S.A. Using naturalistic field methods, this essay reports common questions and concerns of commercial lobstermen, fishermen, and coastal civic leaders. Early-stage conversations suggest that once coastal community members understand the benefits and impacts of wind farm development on their quality of life, many share specific preferences for where offshore developments could be located. Citizens' remarks are sophisticated, nuanced, and innovative and include robust ideas for pairing turbine siting with fishery conservation. Findings imply that when looking to site offshore turbines in public, multiple-use ocean spaces, developers, planners, and coastal communities should engage early and often in two-way conversation rather than one-way outreach.

Underwater noise is increasingly recognized as a source of impact on the marine environment and seismic airguns were one of the first man-made high intensity sound source to receive attention with respect to potential impact on marine mammals. In this study, we investigate the effects of a 3D seismic survey on harbor porpoise echolocation activity in the Danish sector of the North Sea. This was achieved by deploying porpoise click detectors (C-PODs) and sound recorders (SM2M and SM3M) both inside and adjacent to the seismic survey area, before, during and after the survey over a total duration of 9 months. Three echolocation parameters were analyzed: number of clicks per minute, minutes with porpoise echolocation click trains and feeding buzz frequency in relation to all minutes with click trains. Decreases in echolocation signals were detected up to 8-12 km from the active airguns, which may indicate temporary displacement of porpoises or a change in porpoise echolocation behavior. However, no general displacement of harbor porpoises away from the seismic survey area could be detected when comparing to reference stations 15 km away from any seismic activity. Our results add to the understanding that underwater noise has the potential to affect temporarily foraging efficiency in porpoises. While the effect of seismic surveys on harbor porpoise behavior was smaller than what has been found for piledriving, the cumulative effect of anthropogenic impacts could be assessed by evaluation of potential population level consequences.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,15,0,15,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Aarhus Univ, Marine Mammal Res, Dept Biosci, Roskilde, DenmarkTotal E&P Denmark, Hlth Safety & Environm, Esbjerg, Denmark",Total E&P Denmark,,,2020-01-29,WOS:000507985800001,,

Although mitigation within the United States and Europe is principally aimed at reducing risk from acute effects of individual activities, regulators are moving in significant ways towards cumulative, multi-sectoral impact management. Solutions to be discussed include source-quieting methods and technologies for commercial shipping, pile driving, and seismic survey noise; spatial management through the use of programmatic and strategic environmental assessments, particularly for active sonar; and noise budget caps-for example, as a potential outcome of the European Union (EU) Marine Strategy Framework Directive. This paper also will identify the most pressing data needs for conservation management, including data on impacts (e.g., the impacts of offshore windfarm construction and operation on baleen whales), effective mitigation methods and technology (such as noise reduction standards for individual commercial ships), and cumulative effects (including impacts of chronic stress on cetacean morbidity, survival, and reproduction).",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,12,0,19,,,0167-5427,,,,,,,,,,,"Whale & Dolphin Conservat, Chippenham SN15 1LJ, Wilts, EnglandNat Resources Def Council, Marine Mammal Protect, Santa Monica, CA 90401 USA",Whale & Dolphin ConservatNat Resources Def Council,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000365088900002,,

The present article analyzes theoretically a wind turbine generator to improve the efficiency of an autonomous desalination unit. Three climatic zones in coastal Egypt-Mediterranean Sea coast and the Red Sea coast have been evaluated and the acoustic noise analysis and calculation from the proposed wind turbine are presented. The mechanical coupling of wind turbine and helical shaft to break the boundary layer of the basin water surface and, therefore, to enhance the performance of the solar desalination system is studied. The analytical assessment reveals that the Egyptian coastal areas are ideally suited for harvesting wind energy for regional economic development.

Air floating transportation is one of the key technologies for the cost-effective development of bucket foundation. To predict the dynamic behavior of large-diameter tripod bucket foundation (LDTBF) supported by an air cushion and a water plug inside every bucket in waves, three 1/25-scale physical model tests with different bucket spacing were conducted in waves; detailed prototype foundation models were established using a hydrodynamic software MOSES with a draft of 4.0 m, 4.5 m, and 5.0 m and with a water depth of 10.0 m, 11.25 m, and 12.5 m. The numerical and experimental results are consistent for heaving motion, while exhibiting favorable agreement for pitching motion. The results show that the resonant periods for heaving motion increased with increasing draft and water depth. The maximum amplitude for heaving motion first decreased and then increased with the increase of water depth and spacing between the buckets. The maximum amplitude for pitching motion first decreased and then increased with increasing water depth but decreased with increasing spacing between the buckets. The wider the spacing between the bucket foundations, the larger the heave response amplitude operators (RAOs).

The study was conducted in a silty-sand habitat in the southern North Sea (Frisian Front) near gas production platform L07A. Besides standard boxcorer samples, hauls were made with the Triple-D dredge in order to collect relatively rare and larger species. Multivariate analysis showed a distinct difference between the Triple-D samples from the fishery-closed area around the platform and those from the regularly trawled reference subareas. Conspicuous differences were higher abundances of mud shrimps (Callianassa subterranea, Upogebia deltaura) and sensitive bivalves (Arctica islandica, Thracia convexa, Dosinia lupinus, Abra nitida, Cultellus pellucidus) in the non-fished subarea near the platform. Species richness and evenness were higher as well. The boxcore samples did not clearly reveal the distinctness of the non-fished platform subarea. This is attributed to the large proportion of small, short-living species and the relatively low numbers of vulnerable larger species common to all boxcore samples. Nevertheless, boxcore samples did confirm the higher abundance of mud shrimps (Callianassa subterranea, Upogebia deltaura) in the non-fished platform subarea and demonstrated higher densities of the brittlestar Amphiura filiformis. The effect of beam trawling on the presence of long lived large bivalves as we found is in line with previous studies. Despite the positive effect of the fishery-exclusion zone on survival of their adults, however, no evidence was found for higher recruitment rates in this relative small area. Our observation that deep-living mud shrimps are affected by trawling may point to larger consequences for the functioning of the benthic ecosystem than solely loss of biodiversity.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0923-3210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2005-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14208049012,,

In this paper, we report on the improvements in the quality of ocean currents collected from the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP).Initially, the ADCP was deployed in a cage that was suspended below the bridle of the buoy. It was an effort to remove the motion of the surface buoy from the current record. Measurements were made at intervals of 30 to 45 seconds over an hour's time and averaged. The cage required a lengthy cable to carry the current information to the payload within the buoy. The movement (twisting, swinging, and up-and-down motion) of the cage put stress on the cable, which was also exposed to long line gear and other fishing tackle, and the failure rate was high. Several iterations of cable were attempted, but the failure rate of the real-time currents remained high. Because of the averaging method, the currents were under-sampled and represented a considerable period of the changing tidal current.The ADCP was moved inside the bridle just below the buoy to shorten the exposure of the cable to the environment. An additional result of this method is to sample closer to the ocean surface. The sampling interval was increased to 0.5 or 1.0 Hz and the samples are averaged over five minutes. The resulting measurements represent a more appropriate instantaneous current speed and direction and average out the motion of the buoy. A comparison of identically configured buoy-and bottom-mounted ADCPs at Station 41036 off the North Carolina Coast indicate that the methodology produces statistically equivalent currents at all but the surface and bottom bins [1].ADCP data from a large number of oil and gas platforms in the northern Gulf of Mexico are collected, quality controlled, and disseminated to the public by NDBC. The quality control algorithms were developed by a consortium of oil industry, ADCP vendor, and Minerals Management Service experts and implemented by NDBC to quality control the real-time ADCP data in March 2006 [2]. The algorithms were developed for low frequency (38 and 75 kHz) Teledyne RD Instruments (TRDI) ADCPs.The algorithms have been expanded to include the 300, 600, and 1200 kHz TRDI ADCPs. The algorithms test for echo amplitude, percent good beams, error velocity, and horizontal velocities. Additionally, a test to determine the presence of the surface or bottom allows these bins to be included in the data stream as the tide changes.

The development of offshore wind farms offers a unique opportunity because of the associated infrastructure. Service platforms, as well as the pylons themselves, offer perfect structures for mooring longlines and other culture units. One of the advantages of offshore culture may be a lower parasite load in offshore mussels compared with mussels produced under traditional inshore bottom culture. By sampling mussel spat from off. shore suspended buoys or collectors, we simulated an offshore culture situation and compared parasite infestation rates with those in mussel spat obtained from suspended inshore buoys or collectors, in mussels from inshore benthic subtidal beds and from inshore benthic intertidal mussel beds. Mussels from offshore sites were free of trematodes and shellboring polychaetes. Parasitic copepods only occurred at a single offshore site, on a 20-year-old research platform, but not on buoys or collectors exposed for shorter time periods. All three monitored parasite taxa were present at all other sites. The highest prevalence was found for trematodes in inshore benthic intertidal mussels (78.7 +/- 6.4%) and locally reached 100%. Through a variety of detrimental effects, trematodes, parasitic copepods and shell-boring polychaetes are known to affect growth performance and product quality. We therefore propose that offshore mussel production could be a promising culture procedure because it seems to result in lower parasite burden than at traditional culture sites. Whether offshore production also results in better survival and growth, compared with inshore mussel culture on a commercial scale, needs to be investigated further.",,,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,37,1,45,,,0175-8659,1439-0426,,,,,,,,,,"Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Wadden Sea Stn Sylt, D-25992 List Auf Sylt, GermanyAlfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-2850 Bremerhaven, GermanyTerramare Res Ctr, Wilhelmshaven, GermanyBioconsult SH, Hockensbull, GermanyInst Marine Res, Kiel, Germany",Terramare Res CtrBioconsult SHInst Marine Res,,,2005-04-01,WOS:000227968500005,,

Studying the detailed behaviour of marine mammals involves challenges not faced by most animal behaviour researchers due to the size, mobility and lack of continuous visibility of these animals. We describe several methods developed by marine mammal scientists to study behaviour, primarily of cetaceans, focusing on technological advances: unmanned aerial systems (UAS), satellite-linked telemetry, passive acoustics and multisensor high-resolution acoustic recording tags. We then go on to explain how the data collected by these methods have contributed to and informed conservation actions. We focus on examples including: satellite data informing the interactions between cetaceans and offshore oil and gas development; passive acoustics used to track distributions of several species of cetaceans, including their movements near shipping lanes; and high-resolution acoustic recording tags used to document responses of cetaceans to anthropogenic activities. Finally, we discuss recent efforts to link animal behaviour to individual fitness and, particularly for behavioural disturbances, to population-level consequences, which can be helpful for informing conservation efforts. The infusion of technological advancements into studies of cetacean behaviour combined with emerging analytical techniques brings us to the next 20+ years of studying these animals. These developments will improve our capabilities in areas such as testing whether their behaviour adheres to traditional behavioural theory, and will certainly assist the guiding of conservation efforts.

Two sympatric marine predators, grey seals Halichoerus grypus and harbour seals Phoca vitulina, have overlapping ranges on land and at sea but contrasting population dynamics around Britain: whilst grey seals have generally increased, harbour seals have shown significant regional declines. We analysed 2 decades of at sea movement data and terrestrial count data from these species to produce high resolution, broad-scale maps of distribution and associated uncertainty to inform conservation and management. Our results showed that grey seals use offshore areas connected to their haul-out sites by prominent corridors, and harbour seals primarily stay within 50 km of the coastline. Both species show fine-scale offshore spatial segregation off the east coast of Britain and broad-scale partitioning off western Scotland. These results illustrate that, for broad-scale marine spatial planning, the conservation needs of harbour seals (primarily inshore, the exception being selected offshore usage areas) are different from those of grey seals (up to 100 km offshore and corridors connecting these areas to haul-out sites). More generally, our results illustrate the importance of detailed knowledge of marine predator distributions to inform marine spatial planning; for instance, spatial prioritisation is not necessarily the most effective spatial planning strategy even when conserving species with similar taxonomy.",,,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,35,0,41,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ St Andrews, Sea Mammal Res Unit, Scottish Oceans Inst, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, ScotlandUniv St Andrews, Ctr Res Ecol & Environm Modelling, Buchanan Gardens, Observ, St Andrews KY16 9LZ, Fife, ScotlandUniv La Rochelle, CEBC, ILE, CNRS,UMR 7372, F-17000 La Rochelle, FranceNatl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Coastal & Marine Res Ctr, Haulbowline, Cork, IrelandUniv Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, IMAS Sandy Bay, Hobart, Tas 7001, AustraliaUniv Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",,,,2015-08-27,WOS:000360989500016,,

This equation enables wave produced forces on a cylinder supported on the sea bed to be calculated. The study includes observations on the calculation model's sensitivity as to a variation in the cylinder's diameter, on the one hand and, on the other, as to temperature and salinity variation. With this in mind, specific software has been developed to simulate equations in fluid mechanics applied to solve the wave structure interaction problem in the separation, inertial and diffraction range.

The focus was on sediment contamination levels and the detection of disturbance based on two representative invertebrate components of the benthos: molluscs and polychaetes. We tested the hypothesis that significant disturbance to the community has occurred, by examining whether distance from the platform or variation in contaminants explains among-site variation in the composition of benthic communities. Moreover, we also tested the hypothesis that organic enrichment because of oil input has modified the feeding guild structure by examining whether the relative abundances of filter-feeders, deposit-feeders and omnivores are correlated with distance from the platform or with contamination by hydrocarbons. The contamination levels and their spatial distribution in the sediments differed significantly between the two fields, as did their mollusc and polychaete communities. The within-field variability, however, was much lower: no clear structuring of contamination values and species composition and abundance was detectable in relation to distance from the oil platform. Contamination levels were low, often below detection levels or international guideline values. Variation in contaminant concentrations did not explain variation in taxonomic composition and abundance. The relative abundance of the above-mentioned feeding guilds did not correlate with either distance from the platform or with contaminant concentrations. These patterns may reflect the long time that has elapsed since drilling (15-20years), which appears to have allowed contaminants to disperse and degrade and assemblages to recover from the impact, if indeed such a disturbance ever occurred. In contrast to low values of barium and total petroleum hydrocarbons, associated with well drilling, some metals were at their highest concentrations beneath the central platforms. This suggests that production-related activities (including platform cleaning and maintenance) are currently a more relevant contamination source.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,0173-9565,1439-0485,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Vienna, Dept Palaeontol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, AustriaSt Petersburg State Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Hydrobiol, Fac Biol & Soil Sci, St Petersburg, RussiaSlovak Acad Sci, Inst Geol, Bratislava, SlovakiaUniv Vienna, Dept Limnol & Biooceanog, Ctr Ecol, Vienna, Austria",,,,2016-11-09,WOS:000383606200016,,

Whole-body protein breakdown, flux, and oxidation were similar in all groups. The 15% structured triglyceride diet maximized whole-body protein synthesis (p < .05). Liver fractional synthetic rate was significantly greater in animals receiving 5% of nonprotein calories as structured triglyceride (p < .05). Muscle fractional synthetic rate was unchanged.

Monitoring climate change and habitat loss alone is insufficient if we are to understand the effects of these factors on complex biological communities. It is therefore important to identify bioindicator taxa that show measurable responses to climate change and habitat loss and that reflect wider-scale impacts on the biota of interest. We argue that bats have enormous potential as bioindicators: they show taxonomic stability, trends in their populations can be monitored, short- and long-term effects on populations can be measured and they are distributed widely around the globe. Because insectivorous bats occupy high trophic levels, they are sensitive to accumulations of pesticides and other toxins, and changes in their abundance may reflect changes in populations of arthropod prey species. Bats provide several ecosystem services, and hence reflect the status of the plant populations on which they feed and pollinate as well as the productivity of insect communities. Bat populations are affected by a wide range of stressors that affect many other taxa. In particular, changes in bat numbers or activity can be related to climate change (including extremes of drought, heat, cold and precipitation, cyclones and sea level rise), deterioration of water quality, agricultural intensification, loss and fragmentation of forests, fatalities at wind turbines, disease, pesticide use and overhunting. There is an urgent need to implement a global network for monitoring bat populations so their role as bioindicators can be used to its full potential.",,,,,,,,,578,9,0,0,555,28,712,,,1863-5407,1613-4796,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, UK",,,,2009-01-01,BCI:BCI200900514418,,

The current approach to assessing the number and distribution of birds at sea is transect-surveys conducted by trained individuals in boats or planes, or analysis of imagery collected from aerial surveys. These methods can be costly and pose safety concerns so that observation times are limited to daylight hours and fair weather. We propose an alternative method based on analysis of thermal video that could be recorded autonomously. We present a framework for building models to classify birds and bats and their associated behaviors from their flight tracks. As an example, we developed a discriminant model for theoretical flight paths and applied it to data (N = 64 tracks) extracted from 5-minute video clips. The agreement between model- and observer-classified path types was initially only 41%, but it increased to 73% when small-scale jitter was censored and the number of different path types was reduced. Classification of 46 tracks of bats, swallows, gulls, and terns on average was 82% accurate, based on a jackknife cross-validation. Model classification of gulls and swallows (N 18) was on average 73% and 85% correct, respectively. Model classification of bats and terns (N = 4 and 2, respectively) was 94% and 91% correct, respectively; however, the variance associated with the tracks from these targets is poorly estimated. The models developed here should be considered preliminary because they are based on a small data set both in terms of the numbers of species and the identified flight tracks. Future classification models could be improved if the distance between the camera and the target was known. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Ocean sprawl removes or transforms marine habitats through the addition of artificial structures and some of the most significant impacts are occurring in sedimentary environments. Marine sediments have substantial social, ecological, and economic value, as they are rich in biodiversity, crucial to fisheries productivity, and major sites of nutrient transformation. Yet the impact of ocean sprawl on sedimentary environments has largely been ignored. Here we review current knowledge of the impacts to sedimentary ecosystems arising from artificial structures.Artificial structures alter the composition and abundance of a wide variety of sediment-dependent taxa, including microbes, invertebrates, and benthic-feeding fishes. The effects vary by structure design and configuration, as well as the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the environment in which structures are placed. The mechanisms driving effects from artificial structures include placement loss, habitat degradation, modification of sound and light conditions, hydrodynamic changes, organic enrichment and material fluxes, contamination, and altered biotic interactions. Most studies have inferred mechanism based on descriptive work, comparing biological and physical processes at various distances from structures. Further experimental studies are needed to identify the relative importance of multiple mechanisms and to demonstrate causal relationships. Additionally, past studies have focused on impacts at a relatively small scale, and independently of other development that is occurring. There is need to quantify large-scale and cumulative effects on sedimentary ecosystems as artificial structures proliferate. We highlight the importance for comprehensive monitoring using robust survey designs and outline research strategies needed to understand, value, and protect marine sedimentary ecosystems in the face of a rapidly changing environment.

Europe, the US., and Japan already have long histories of research into wind power due to its high efficiency. The tower structure that supports a wind turbine is one important research area. There are three types of tower that vary by structural composition: a cylindrical tower with a circular cross-section, a jacket tower with a truss structure, and a hybrid tower. This paper investigates an accident involving a 600kW wind turbine that occurred in JeJu, Korea in October of 2010. The results from a numerical analysis are compared with the actual collapse mode observed at the accident. Some buckling modes and wind speeds at which non-linear buckling response occurs are predicted via the arc-length method for a land-based cylindrical stationary tower. The evaluation method is used accident (experiment), analytical. linear and nonlinear finite element method (beam and shell) to analyze the result of predicted buckling load of tower. The result of nonlinear FEM shell model was found to exhibit similar behavior to the accident situation during buckling. It is concluded that this paper provides buckling analysis process and method used for the slender shell structures: the predicted buckling load and analysis methodology In this paper, The results from the numerical estimation show good agreement with those of the analytical calculation, indicating that the arc-length method effectively improved the convergence. We found out buckling limit load of the accident wind turbine tower and wind speed at buckling point. The result of nonlinear FEM shell model was found to exhibit similar behavior to the actual accident (experiment) situation during buckling. The presented buckling evaluation method will be useful for both static design and dynamic performance evaluation of land-based wind turbines, as well as sea-based wind turbines.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,0,19,,,2234-7593,,,,,,,,,,,"Korea Inst Energy Res, Distributed Power Generat & Energy Storage Ctr, Taejon 305343, South KoreaKorean Register Shipping, Green & Ind Technol Ctr, Taejon 305343, South Korea",Korean Register Shipping,,,2012-10-31,WOS:000309325100014,,

These systems guarantee certain structural integrity conditions thay may be jeopardised by the aggressive marine environment, which may cause corrosion processes if the structural material is not conveniently protected. The main strategy to avoid corrosion in this type of structures is to provide protective coatings, which in this particular case must have an adequate behaviour not only against the proper marine environment, but also against the abrasion and the impact loads generated by the violent contacts between the service vessel and the boat landing system.This work develops a comprehensive analysis to define a protective coating that provides simultaneously an adequate corrosion protection and a sufficient resistance against abrasion and impact loads. Based on industrial practice and a literature review, a number of tentative proposals were established, combining different metallization strategies, epoxy intermediate layers and external paints. The proposals were successively subjected to corrosion, abrasion and impact tests, discarding, after each set of tests, those providing unsatisfactory results. The final solution consists of 3 consecutive layers: thermal sprayed aluminium, a two-component polyamine cured pure epoxy, and a two-component chemically curing aliphatic acrylic polyurethane topcoat.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0012-7361,1989-1490,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Cantabria, LADICIM Lab Mat Sci & Engn, ETS Ingenieros Caminos Canales & Puertos, Av Castros 44, Santander 39005, SpainDEGIMA, Av Juan Carlos 1,2, Camargo 39600, SpainCDTUC, INESCO Ingenieros, Av Castros 44, Santander 39005, SpainUniv Cantabria, IH Cantabria, Environm Hydraul Inst Cantabria, C Isabel Torres 15, Santander 39011, SpainDRACE Infraestruct, Av Camino Santiago 50, Madrid 28050, Spain",DEGIMACDTUCDRACE Infraestruct,,,2019-11-01,WOS:000493808300010,,

Most studies only assess eDNA which, compared to eRNA, can persist longer in the environment after cell death. Therefore, eRNA may provide a more immediate census of the environment due to its relatively weaker stability, leading some researchers to advocate for the use of eRNA as an additional, or perhaps superior proxy for portraying ecological changes. A variety of pre-treatment techniques for screening eDNA and eRNA derived operational taxonomic units (OTUs) have been employed prior to statistical analyses, including removing singleton taxa (i.e., OTUs found only once) and discarding those not present in both eDNA and eRNA datasets. In this study, we used bacterial (16S ribosomal RNA gene) and eukaryotic (18S ribosomal RNA gene) eDNA- and eRNA-derived data from benthic communities collected at increasing distances along a transect from an oil production platform (Taranaki, New Zealand). Macro-infauna (visual classification of benthic invertebrates) and physico-chemical data were analyzed in parallel. We tested the effect of removing singleton taxa, and removing taxa not present in the eDNA and eRNA libraries from the same environmental sample (trimmed by shared OTUs), by comparing the impact of the oil production platform on alpha- and beta-diversity of the eDNA/eRNA-based biological assemblages, and by correlating these to the morphologically identified macro-faunal communities and the physico-chemical data. When trimmed by singletons, presence/absence information from eRNA data represented the best proxy to detect changes on species diversity for both bacteria and eukaryotes. However, assessment of quantitative beta-diversity from read abundance information of bacteria eRNA did not, contrary to eDNA, reveal any impact from the oil production activity. Overall, the data appeared more robust when trimmed by shared OTUs, showing a greater effect of the platform on alpha-and beta-diversity. Trimming by shared OTUs likely removes taxa derived from legacy DNA and technical artefacts introduced through reverse transcriptase, polymerase-chain-reaction and sequencing. Findings from our scoping study suggest that metabarcoding-based biomonitoring surveys should, if funds, time and expertise allow, be assessed using both eDNA and eRNA products.",,,,,,,,,60,3,0,0,57,0,71,,,2167-8359,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New ZealandCawthron Inst, Environm Technol Coastal & Freshwater Grp, Nelson, New ZealandUniv Waikato, Environm Res Inst, Hamilton, New ZealandKing Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi ArabiaUniv Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland, New Zealand",,,,2017-05-17,WOS:000401845500009,28533985,

Despite high levels of intra-specific variability in physiological response, we find that changes in the behaviour of some functionally important species can be dependent on the class of broadband sound (continuous or impulsive).

The speed at which they swim both determines the acoustic exposure and impacts the energetic costs of a behavioral response. Therefore, information on swimming speed is important for estimating the potential impact of pile driving sounds on the hearing, the energetics, and the population dynamics of harbor porpoises. The video recordings from the Kastelein et al. (2013b) study were analyzed for swimming speed.

We tested the use of molecular markers, morphometric measures, and stable isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) and trace element concentrations in the first primary feather (grown at the end of the breeding period) to assign the geographic origin of Calonectris shearwaters. Overall, we sampled birds from three taxa: 13 Mediterranean Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea diomedea) breeding sites, 10 Atlantic Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis) breeding sites, and one Cape Verde Shearwater (C. edwardsii) breeding site. Assignment rates were investigated at three spatial scales: breeding colony, breeding archipelago, and taxa levels. Genetic analyses based on the mitochondrial control region (198 birds from 21 breeding colonies) correctly assigned 100% of birds to the three main taxa but failed in detecting geographic structuring at lower scales. Discriminant analyses based on trace elements composition achieved the best rate of correct assignment to colony (77.5%). Body measurements or stable isotopes mainly succeeded in assigning individuals among taxa (87.9% and 89.9%, respectively) but failed at the colony level (27.1% and 38.0%, respectively). Combining all three approaches (morphometrics, isotopes, and trace elements on 186 birds from 15 breeding colonies) substantially improved correct classifications (86.0%, 90.7%, and 100% among colonies, archipelagos, and taxa, respectively). Validations using two independent data sets and jackknife cross-validation confirmed the robustness of the combined approach in the colony assignment (62.5%, 58.8%, and 69.8% for each validation test, respectively). A preliminary application of the discriminant model based on stable isotope delta N-15 and delta C-13 values and trace elements (219 birds from 17 breeding sites) showed that 41 Cory's Shearwaters caught by western Mediterranean long-liners came mainly from breeding colonies in Menorca (48.8%), Ibiza (14.6%), and Crete (31.7%).

The present study compares levels of stress hormones and mRNA expression of cytokines and acute-phase proteins in blood samples of harbour porpoises exposed to different levels of stress during handling, in rehabilitation or permanent human care.Free-ranging harbour porpoises, incidentally caught in pound nets in Denmark, were compared to harbour porpoises in rehabilitation at SOS Dolfijn in Harderwijk, the Netherlands, and individuals permanently kept in human care in the Dolfinarium Harderwijk and Fjord & Belt Kerteminde, Denmark. Blood samples were investigated for catecholamines, adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine, as well as for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, metanephrine and normetanephrine. mRNA expression levels of relevant cell mediators (cytokines IL-10 and TNF alpha, acute-phase proteins haptoglobin and C-reactive protein and the heat shock protein HSP70) were measured using real-time PCR.Results: Biomarker expression levels varied between free-ranging animals and porpoises in human care. Hormone and cytokine ranges showed correlations to each other and to the health status of investigated harbour porpoises. Hormone concentrations were higher in free-ranging harbour porpoises than in animals in human care. Adrenaline can be used as a parameter for the initial reaction to acute stress situations; noradrenaline, dopamine, ACTH and cortisol are more likely indicators for the following minutes of acute stress. There is evidence for different correlations between production of normetanephrine, metanephrine, cortisol and the expression of IL-10, HSP70 and haptoglobin.Conclusions: The expression patterns of the selected molecular biomarkers of the immune system are promising to reflect the health and immune status of the harbour porpoise under different levels of stress.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,18,0,23,,,,1746-6148,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Terr & Aquat Wildlife Res, D-25761 Foundation, Busum, GermanyHelmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, GermanyVet Clin, D-25764 Reinsbuttel, GermanyAarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-4000 Roskilde, DenmarkDolfinarium Harderwijk, NL-3841 AB Harderwijk, NetherlandsFjord & Belt, DK-5300 Kerteminde, DenmarkSOS Dolfijn, NL-3841 AB Harderwijk, Netherlands",Vet ClinDolfinarium HarderwijkFjord & BeltSOS Dolfijn,,,2013-08-29,WOS:000322725100001,23866055,

Here, we document the existence of local communities of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) inhabiting coastal and estuarine waters of Perth, Western Australia, where major coastal developments have been undertaken or are proposed. Using sighting histories from a 4-year photo-identification study, we investigated fine-scale, social community structure of dolphins based on measures of social affinity, and network (Half-Weight Index HWI, preferred dyadic association tests, and Lagged Association Rates LAR), home ranges, residency patterns (Lagged Identification Rates LIR), and genetic relatedness. Analyses revealed four socially and spatially distinct, mixed-sex communities. The four communities had distinctive social patterns varying in strength, site fidelity, and residency patterns. Overlap in home ranges and relatedness explained little to none of the association patterns between individuals, suggesting complex local social structures. The study demonstrated that environmental impact assessments for mobile, continuously distributed species must evaluate impacts in light of local population structure, especially where proposed developments may affect core habitats of resident communities or sub-populations. Here, the risk of local extinction is particularly significant for an estuarine community because of its small size, limited connectivity with adjacent communities, and use of areas subject to intensive human use.

Soaring raptors, such as the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), have proven particularly vulnerable to collisions. In this study, we compared white-tailed eagle flight behavior both inside and outside of the Smola windpower plant on coastal Central Norway. During the eagle breeding period (mid-Mar-end May 2008), we collected data on flight activity (directional flight, social behavior, and soaring) and flight altitude (below, within, and above the rotor-swept zone [RSZ]) at 12 vantage points; 6 within the wind-power plant and 6 outside (control area). We found that white-tailed eagles did not show any clear avoidance flight responses to the wind turbines. Hence, we found no significant differences in the total amount of flight activity within and outside the power-plant area. However, we found less flight activity among adults than among subadults within the power plant compared with the control area. We also found a slightly increased probability of flight activity in the RSZ within the power plant, which obviously may increase the risk of collision with wind turbines. Our findings may help explain the relatively high mortality rate of white-tailed eagles in the windpower- plant area and the recorded peak in eagle fatalities during the breeding season.

A dose-dependent relationship was found for metabolites for most of the PAH and AP, although results were less clear for the more volatile substances such as phenol and naphthalene. The concentration of bile metabolites from fish exposed through water rose with increasing lipophilicity, but this relationship was less clear for fish exposed through diet.

The length of the monopile is adjusted by a rotation of the screw thread carved on the monopile for the investigation of the natural frequency and moment. The impact lateral load is applied by the pendulum hammer, which falls at the fixed pendulum length and angle. For the analyses of the monopile behavior due to the impact loading, strain guages are symmetrically installed on the surface of the monopile in the axial direction. Experimental results show that the maximum moment increases with the increase of natural frequency of the monopile.

Indicators of ecological integrity were used to assess altering conditions and possible ecosystem shifts ranging from systems' degradations to the development of highly productive and diverse artificial reef systems.

Particulars of this research are to investigate the unique and crucial effects of wind load on the spar-type FOWT, which differs considerably from other traditional spar-type floating systems utilized in the gas and oil industry, on the VIMs. The model test was performed with a sequence of current, wind, and irregular wave sea states to analyze the nature of the coupled dynamic response behavior of VIMs. Many unique characteristics were found and analyzed. The lock-in phenomenon of sway in the cross flow (CF) direction was found to occur first, followed by the lock-in phenomenon of surge in the in-line (IL) direction. For the current-only case, the remaining responses, including the other 4-degree-of-freedom motions, mooring tensions, and turbine bearing loads, were found to be coupled by sway/surge VIMs. Moreover, the oscillation amplitudes of all of the responses increased significantly with increasing current velocity, particularly after locking-in. Furthermore, the wind load had a clear suppression effect on the CF and IL VIM responses. The experimental measurements demonstrated that the wave load excites wave-induced oscillations for some CF responses and all IL responses, and it further restrains the VIM oscillation amplitudes on the foundation of the wind suppression effect. In particular, when a wind load is involved, the influence of current or wave is limited to the yaw and IL tower-top bending moment.

It poses significant problems for the designers of large foundations for port, bridge and offshore wind turbine structures that have to sustain severe environmental loading over their many decades in service. Particular difficulties are faced when employing large driven steel piles to secure the structures in place. While driven pile foundation solutions have many potential advantages, chalk is highly sensitive to pile driving and to service loading conditions, such as the repeated cyclic buffeting applied to bridge, harbour and offshore structures by storm winds and wave impacts. Current guidance regarding how to allow for difficult pile driving conditions or predict the piles' vertical and lateral response to loads is notoriously unreliable in chalk. There is also no current industrial guidance regarding the potentially positive effects of time (after driving) on pile behaviour or the generally negative impact of the cyclic loading that the structures and their piled foundations will inevitably experience. These shortfalls in knowledge are introducing great uncertainty into the assessment and design of a range of projects around the UK and Northern Europe. Particularly affected are a series of planned and existing major offshore wind farm developments. The uncertainty regarding foundation design and performance poses a threat to the economic and safe harnessing of vital renewable, low carbon, offshore energy supplies. Better design guidelines will reduce offshore wind energy costs and also help harbour and transport projects to progress and function effectively, so delivering additional benefits to both individual consumers and UK Industry.The research proposed will generate new driven pile design guidance for chalk sites through a comprehensive programme of high quality field tests, involving multiple loading scenarios, on 21 specially instrumented driven tubular steel test piles, at an onshore test site in Kent. This will form a benchmark set of results that will be complemented by comprehensive advanced drilling, sampling, in-situ testing and laboratory experiments, supported by rigorous analysis and close analysis of other case history data. The key aim is to develop design procedures that overcome, for chalk, the current shortfalls in knowledge regarding pile driving, ageing, static and cyclic response under axial and lateral loading. The main deliverable will be new guidelines for practical design that will be suitable for both onshore and offshore applications.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/P033091/1,,,,,,,,Imperial College London,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15403029,,

Thus, this energy scenario necessitates the incorporation of renewable energy technologies with power systems to enhance its generation capacity, and to overcome electricity outage of approximately 812 hours, in the country. In this paper, the authors encouraged the state policy for utilizing the wind energy for power generation, which is freely available across 1600 km long coastal belt of Pakistan. For this purpose, wind potential is explicitly evaluated across Sindh and Baluchistan provinces in Pakistan. The energy generated by various wind turbine prototypes is employed to suggest the most optimum location through optimal probability function. Moreover, this study provides an evocative progression based on real-time wind data to integrate wind power for rural electrification across the coastal zones of Pakistan.

Seabirds have been implicated as possible reservoirs of this bacterium in the Arabian Gulf and in the Western Indian Ocean. Recently, Coxiella species closely related to C. burnetii was detected from ticks collected from oil rigs used as roosting areas by Socotra Cormorants (Phalacrocorax nigrogularis) in the western Arabian Gulf. We collected ticks from the largest breeding colony of Socotra Cormorants in the United Arab Emirates on the eastern extreme of the species' breeding range to determine the prevalence of C. burnetii and evaluate its role as a wild reservoir. All ticks were identified as Ornithodoros muesebecki and genomic DNA was extracted from larval and nymph/adult tick pools. Multiplex PCR tests were performed targeting three C. burnetii specific genes. C. burnetii was not detected although a Coxiella-like endosymbiont was identified that was closely related to Coxiella symbionts from Ornithodoros capensis ticks. Because domestic and wild ungulates are the primary source of C burnetii, we suggest that the presence of free-ranging, native and non-native ungulates in some off-shore islands in the Arabian Gulf could disseminate C. burnetii to seabirds. More comprehensive studies on seabird colonies are needed to better understand the diversity and prevalence of Coxiella symbionts and to establish if C burnetii is endemic on some of these islands.

No significant differences were observed in nematode total density, number of taxa and the overall assemblage structure between the control and impact treatments from before to after the experimental spill.

The plume was only observed downwind of circumnavigated gas fields, and three methods are used to determine its source. First, a mass balance calculation assuming a gas field source gives a CH4 emission rate between 2.5 +/- 0.8x10(4) and 4.6 +/- 1.5x10(4) kg h(-1). This would be greater than the industry's reported 0.5% leak rate if it were emitting for more than half the time. Second, annual average UK CH4 emissions are combined with an atmospheric dispersion model to create pseudo-observations. Clean air from the North Atlantic passed over mainland UK, picking up anthropogenic emissions. To best explain the observed plume using pseudo-observations, an additional North Sea source from the gas rigs area is added. Third, the. delta C-13-CH4 from the plume is shown to be -53%, which is lighter than fossil gas but heavier than the UK average emission. We conclude that either an additional small-area mainland source is needed, combined with temporal variability in emission or transport in small-scale meteorological features. Alternatively, a combination of additional sources that are at least 75% from the mainland (-58%) and up to 25% from the North Sea gas rigs area (-32%) would explain the measurements. Had the isotopic analysis not been performed, the likely conclusion would have been of a gas field source of CH4. This demonstrates the limitation of analyzing mole fractions alone, as the simplest explanation is rejected based on analysis of isotopic data.Plain Language Summary In the study, we have analyzed aircraft data to try and identify the source of a plume of methane observed over the North Sea. The flight circuited North Sea gas fields with the aim of intercepting any fugitive methane. Initial analysis of the amount of methane present and its location suggested that the methane was being emitted from the gas field area, and this was supported by dispersion modeling of the case. However, analysis of carbon isotopes in methane revealed that fugitive gas could not have been the primary component of the plume. As methane is often measured without analysis of its carbon isotopes, the authors feel that this is an important cautionary tale. We present our analysis of this case study with recommendations for how best to conduct such analyses in the future to try and avoid potential misdiagnosis of methane plume sources.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,5,0,16,,,2169-897X,2169-8996,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Cambridge, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Cambridge, EnglandNatl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, EnglandRoyal Holloway Univ London, Dept Earth Sci, Egham, Surrey, EnglandUniv East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich, Norfolk, EnglandBritish Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, EnglandUniv Manchester, Sch Earth Atmospher & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, EnglandManchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Res Enterprise & Innovat, Manchester, Lancs, EnglandUK Meteorol Off, Exeter, Devon, EnglandCranfield Univ, FAAM, Cranfield, Beds, EnglandNorwegian Inst Air Res NILU, Inst Veien, Dept Atmospher & Climate Res, Kjeller, Norway",,,,2017-09-06,WOS:000408346000025,,

Comparisons of occupied and unoccupied colonies found that the former were generally taller than the latter.

Although B. amplus did not display any preferences for any of the host species examined, D. gemmacea tended to have more gobies than did J juncea. This may be due to the structural difference between the unbranched, J. juncea and the multiple-branching, D. gemmacea, thus hinting at the influence of habitat structure on the goby Population.

Interest in SIA and linked concepts such as social licence to operate is growing, yet marine environments also have potential to raise additional complexity in project governance. Drawing on qualitative research conducted in Tomakomai and Japan more widely across the project development and implementation phase, the paper argues that building an understanding of the social, cultural and historical relationship between the community, industry and the sea is crucial to understanding the neutral or cautiously supportive response of the citizens and stakeholders in Tomakomai to the project. Moreover, effective SIA in coastal regions needs to find a way to account for or at least make visible these complex relations between society and the sea. Based on the findings, it is suggested that developers or policymakers overseeing SIA in coastal regions ought to pay extra attention to the extent to which developments like CCS are viewed by communities as 'new' as opposed to a continuation of existing activities in the sea; to the importance of engagement on monitoring during the project operations phase; and to the non-economic values such as pride and identity which communities and stakeholders may derive from the sea.",,,,,,,,,25,1,0,0,5,0,27,,,0308-597X,1872-9460,,,,,,,,,,"Robert Gordon Univ, Sch Appl Social Studies, Aberdeen AB10 7QG, ScotlandMarine Ecol Res Inst, Appl Biol Grp, 4-7-17 Arahama, Kashiwazaki, Niigata 9450322, JapanRes Inst Innovat Technol Earth, Storage Res Grp CO2, 9-2 Kizugawadai, Kyoto 6190292, Japan",Marine Ecol Res Inst,,,2017-09-01,WOS:000407410200030,,

As wind development becomes more prevalent, existing users of the ocean space, such as commercial shippers, will be compelled to share their historically open-access waters with these projects. Here, we demonstrate the utility of using cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to support siting decisions within a CMSP framework. In this study, we assume that large-scale offshore wind development will take place in the US Mid-Atlantic within the next decades. We then evaluate whether building projects nearshore or far from shore would be more cost-effective. Building projects nearshore is assumed to require rerouting of the commercial vessel traffic traveling between the US Mid-Atlantic ports by an average of 18.5 km per trip. We focus on less than 1500 transits by large deep-draft vessels. We estimate that over 29 years of the study, commercial shippers would incur an additional $0.2 billion (in 2012$) in direct and indirect costs. Building wind projects closer to shore where vessels used to transit would generate approximately $13.4 billion (in 2012$) in savings. Considering the large cost savings, modifying areas where vessels transit needs to be included in the portfolio of policies used to support the growth of the offshore wind industry in the US.

From there it likely will spread to other areas of the Greater Caribbean. The lionfish example demonstrates that it eventually happens, and can do so rapidly. Reduced temperature effects on the physiology of this species were examined to better predict its survivability in the northern Gulf during winter, when sea surface temperatures fall as low as 15 degrees C along the coast. Overall, our results show that when the degree of experimental temperature decline was large and rapid, no compensation occurred and the stress response observed mostly reflected cellular processes that minimized damage. Integrated biomarker response values were significantly different between fish rapidly exposed to colder vs. warmer temperatures (declines of -4 degrees C each day, from 26 to 14 degrees C), reflected in higher values of blood metabolites and routine metabolic rates observed in fish exposed to 14 and 18 degrees C respectively, and lower activity of all enzymes, lower protein carbonylation, and higher oxidative damage to lipids in fish exposed to 14 degrees C. While the physiological proxies responded to minimize damage during the rapid-decrease experiment, the same proxies reflected the consequences of compensation when fish were thermally challenged after a 45 days acclimation at 18 degrees C. In this case, lower values of blood metabolites and high antioxidant levels and indicators of damages underpinned its pejus lower range. Based on the results of the present work, it seems clear that low winter SSTs in the northern Gulf will slow down the colonization of the inshore area of N. cyanomos.

The theoretical model- simulated performance results with 32,000ppm NaCl, equivalent to typical Ocean water of 35,000ppm, are consistent with experimental results and reveal high recovery (50%) over a wide flux range (10-25lmh) which extrapolate to the energy of 1.24kWh/m(3) (85% eff. of HP and 75% eff of CP) and1.05kWh/m(3) (100% eff of HP and 100% eff of CP) under near-zero flux conditions demonstrating performance at the theoretical minimum energy level unmatched by any conventional technique.

The primary aim of this exercise is to provide guidance for (more) integrated EBM in the North Sea based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of those management measures in contributing to the conservation of marine biodiversity. A secondary aim is to identify the requirements of the knowledge base to guide such future EBM initiatives.Starting from the societal goals we performed a scoping exercise to identify a focal social-ecological system which is a subset of the full social-ecological system but considered adequate to guide EBM towards the achievement of those societal goals. A semi-quantitative risk assessment including all the relevant human activities, their pressures and the impacted ecosystem components was then applied to identify the main threats to the North Sea biodiversity and evaluate the effectiveness of the management measures to mitigate those threats.This exercise revealed the need for such risk-based approaches in providing a more integrated perspective but also the trade-off between being comprehensive but qualitative versus quantitative but limited in terms of the focal part of the SES that can be covered. The findings in this paper provide direction to the (further) development of EBM and its knowledge base that should ultimately allow an integrated perspective while maintaining its capacity to deliver the accuracy and detail needed for decision-making.

In the proximity of oil platforms, ship routes, fish farms, etc. marine slicks are often identified as oil spills or biogenic films. However, probability of false alarm when detecting film slicks is very high because of the occurrence of structures in radar images looking similar but not related to surface films (look-alikes). One of the most frequent look-alikes is wind depression areas (WDAs) where the wind excitation of short surface waves is reduced compared to the ambient background. Results of field observations of films slicks and WDA are described and differences in character of wind wave attenuation in different parts of the wind wave spectrum are revealed.

In this time scientists from universities and research institutions have made more than 120 visits to oil rigs, drill ships and survey vessels operated by 16 oil companies, in order to work with the industry's Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV). Visits have taken place in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Australasia at water depths from 100 m to nearly 3000 m. The project has directly produced > 40 peer reviewed publications and data from the project's > 2600 entry online image and video archive have been used in many others. The aim of this paper is to highlight examples of how valuable data can be obtained through collaboration with hydrocarbon exploration and production companies to use existing industry infrastructure to increase scientific discovery in unexplored areas and augment environmental monitoring of industrial activity.The large number of industry ROVs operating globally increases chance encounters with large, enigmatic marine organisms. SERPENT video observations include the deepest known records of species previously considered epipelagic such as scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and southern sunfish (Mola ramsayi) and the first in situ observations of pelagic species such as oarfish (Regalecus glesne). Such observations enable improvements to distribution records and description of behaviour of poorly understood species. Specimen collection has been used for taxonomic descriptions, functional studies and natural products chemistry research. Anthropogenic effects been assessed at the local scale using in situ observations and sample collection at the time of drilling operations and subsequent visits have enabled study of recovery from drilling.Future challenges to be addressed using the SERPENT approach include ensuring unique faunal observations by industry ROV operators are reported, further study of recovery from deep-water drilling activity and to carry out in situ studies to improve the understanding of potential future decommissioning of obsolete hydrocarbon infrastructure.

We developed an approach to estimate the statistical power of discrete survey events to identify species-specific hotspots and coldspots of long-term seabird abundance in marine environments. We illustrate our approach using historical seabird data from survey transects in the US. Atlantic Ocean Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), an area that has been divided into lease blocks for proposed offshore wind energy development. For our power analysis, we examined whether discrete lease blocks within the region could be defined as hotspots (3 x mean abundance in the OCS) or coldspots (1/3 x) for individual species within a given season. For each of 74 species/season combinations, we determined which of eight candidate statistical distributions (ranging in their degree of skewedness) best fit the count data. We then used the selected distribution and estimates of regional prevalence to calculate and map statistical power to detect hotspots and coldspots, and estimate the p-value from Monte Carlo significance tests that specific lease blocks are in fact hotspots or coldspots relative to regional average abundance. The power to detect species-specific hotspots was higher than that of coldspots for most species because species-specific prevalence was relatively low (mean: 0.111; SD: 0.110). The number of surveys required for adequate power (>0.6) was large for most species (tens to hundreds) using this hotspot definition. Regulators may need to accept higher proportional effect sizes, combine species into groups, and/or broaden the spatial scale by combining lease blocks in order to determine optimal placement of wind farms. Our power analysis approach provides a general framework for both retrospective analyses and future avian survey design and is applicable to a broad range of research and conservation problems.

Nevertheless, little is known as to how marine organisms respond to their presence. The composition and distribution of intertidal epibiota at different positions around different types of defence structures (groynes and breakwaters) at three stations along the Emilia Romagna coast (Italy) were analysed. Sampling covered a range of scales: meters (distance among replicate plots), hundreds of meters (distance among replicate areas) and tens of kilometres (distance among stations). The colonisation and dynamics of conspicuous species over I year, following maintenance works on two structures, were also quantified. Assemblages on defence structures were characterised by a notably low richness of species, by strong spatial dominance of mussels and green ephemeral algae, and by high rates of colonisation. Abundance of mussels, Enteromorpha intestinalis and filamentous algae differed significantly among nearby areas within stations. Mussels were significantly less abundant along the landward side of breakwaters compared with all other positions on both groynes and breakwaters. Overall, however, fewer differences, than expected, were observed in the distribution of species at different positions around groynes and breakwaters, probably as a consequence of the low complexity of the colonising assemblages. Possible factors explaining the patterns of distribution observed are discussed, including the roles of harvesting of mussels and frequent maintenance works on the structures. The implications of the low richness of species observed in terms of management of defence structures and other human-made constructions are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The development of these facilities will unavoidably exert environmental pressures on marine ecosystems. It is therefore crucial that the economic costs, the use of marine space and the environmental impacts of these activities remain within acceptable limits. Moreover, the installation of arrays of wave energy devices is still far from being economically feasible due to many combined aspects, such as immature technologies for energy conversion, local energy storage and moorings. Therefore, multi-purpose solutions combining renewable energy from the sea (wind, wave, tide), aquaculture and transportation facilities can be considered as a challenging, yet advantageous, way to boost blue growth. This would be due to the sharing of the costs of installation and using the produced energy locally to feed the different functionalities and optimizing marine spatial planning. This paper focuses on the synergies that may be produced by a multi-purpose offshore installation in a relatively calm sea, i.e., the Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy, and specifically offshore Venice. It analyzes the combination of aquaculture, energy production from wind and waves, and energy storage or transfer. Alternative solutions are evaluated based on specific criteria, including the maturity of the technology, the environmental impact, the induced risks and the costs. Based on expert judgment, the alternatives are ranked and a preliminary layout of the selected multi-purpose installation for the case study is proposed, to further allow the exploitation of the synergies among different functionalities.",,,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,4,0,40,,,2071-1050,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bologna, Dept Civil Chem Environm & Mat Engn, I-40136 Bologna, ItalyUniv Roma TRE, Dept Engn, I-00146 Rome, ItalyKefalonia Fisheries SA Livadi, Lixouri 28200, Kefalonia, GreeceENEL Ingn & Ric, I-56122 Pisa, ItalyUniv Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, BIGEA, I-48123 Ravenna, ItalyUniv Bologna, Dept Econ, I-47921 Rimini, ItalyInst Protect Environm Res, I-00144 Rome, ItalyCyprus Inst, Energy Environm & Water Res Ctr, CY-1645 Nicosia, CyprusPlymouth Marine Lab, The Hoe, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England",Kefalonia Fisheries SA LivadiInst Protect Environm ResCyprus Inst,,,2015-06-01,WOS:000357593000024,,

Corals and oysters collected from both sampling trips had lower PAH accumulation than most bivalves collected in previous studies near the shoreline of Louisiana and elsewhere in the Gulf of Mexico. In April, total PAR (TPAH) concentrations ranged from 8.73 to 15.17 ng g(-1) in corals and 2.52 to 22.04 ng g(-1) in oysters. In May, corals and oysters had elevated concentrations of TPAH ranging from 24.28 to 79.23 ng g(-1) and 7.18 to 95.55 ng g(-1), respectively. This increase could be a result of Mississippi River flooding that occurred during that time, as evidenced by the high perylene concentrations (3.92-41.49 ng g(-1)) measured in May oysters. Oysters and corals collected in May from MC21B, the closest rig to the Mississippi River Delta, had the highest TPAH concentrations observed among all locations and the only rig to have predominantly petrogenic source inputs. Overall, given the low baseline of PAHs demonstrated in this study and the rapid accumulation of diagnostic chemicals in response to a possible contamination event (i.e. sediment plume from May flooding), oil-rig invertebrates could make excellent monitoring tools to examine the exposure to and recovery from oil (and oil-spill response options) in the offshore Northern Gulf of Mexico. Pre-spill baseline data of chemical and biological biomarkers of contamination is key to better estimating the impacts and recovery of oil exposure. Therefore, this screen of PAH accumulation represents a crucial first step in determining baseline contaminant levels in order to utilize these unique resources as monitors for offshore oil exposure in the Northern Gulf of Mexico.

This allowed us to demonstrate how each of these three factors significantly affects the community structure of amphipods.

However, the use of large areas of the sea for wind farms can impact on marine ecosystems and on the many species that depend on these ecosystems, from sandeels to seabirds, and the important services these ecosystems provide, such as fisheries and recreation. As a result, many stakeholders might be affected by new wind farms, including commercial, government, nature conservation and community interests. Depending on where wind farms are located, different trade-offs between these benefits will need to be made. Ecological researchers have developed oceanographic models that can predict how the addition of 100s of large gravity based windmills will change the movement and accumulation patterns of bottom sediment and in what locations there will be hydrographic changes sufficient to affect the amount of plankton (the base of the marine food chain) produced. From previous research, we can predict the consequential changes in the distributions of sandeels, seabirds and marine mammals.Economists and social scientists have developed ways of assimilating ecological evidence to assess the ecosystem services impacts on stakeholders of large scale changes, such as in agricultural practices (Bateman et al. 2013 Science 341:45-50). Together they evaluate how changes in ecosystem services in terrestrial settings are viewed socially, culturally, economically and legally. However, in the marine environment, and because of the infancy of large offshore developments, marine renewable energy industries do not currently have an established or standardised process to evaluate the ecological, economic and cultural trade-offs inherent in alternative locations of offshore windfarms. This project brings together leading ecological, economic, social-cultural, and legal experts from the University of Aberdeen, the Scottish Association for Marine Science, the James Hutton Institute and Marine Scotland Science with 3 marine renewable energy companies; Seagreen, Repsol & MainStream RP. Together, this group will co-develop a decision-support system to assess large scale changes in ecosystem services in the marine environment. Using a case study of the wider Firth of Forth, Scotland, where there are plans for a Marine Protected Area in the same location as the windfarms, these partners will bring together a wide range of stakeholders (fishing industry, marine wildlife NGOs, local community leaders and environmental businesses) to map out different types of evidence, discuss their different and shared values and evaluate different spatial wind farm scenarios to inform decisions. At the core of the projects there will be 2 workshops; the first of which uses the rich amount of existing data for this area to develop a common understanding of the social-ecological system. The 2nd will explore ecosystem service trade-offs under different wind turbine configuration scenarios. This project will facilitate the rare opportunity of providing the interaction needed to enhance business's and stakeholder's understanding of ecosystem services in the context of a real situation at just the right time for immediate implementation.The CORPORATES project will produce a user's guide on how to run this process, so that it can become a standardised tool for the industry. This can bring substantial benefits to industry, as business plans can be better aligned to different stakeholder interests and communal values, increasing support for plans, reducing the risk of conflict and improving the reputation of the company.

The expression of CYP1A, CYP2M1- and 2K1-like proteins was examined for use as possible biomarkers of PFW exposure. A pilot study on the Northwest Shelf of Australia had indicated that PFW contamination possibly contributes to induction of CYP1A-like proteins in Gold-Spotted Trevally (Carangoides fulvoguttatus). The pilot study samples were re-examined for CYP1A, and, in addition, CYP2K1/2M1-like proteins. In a subsequent caged fish study in the same location a second species, Stripey seaperch (Lutjanus carponotatus), caught at a clean site, were distributed to three caging sites in a PFW gradient from the Harriet A production platform: A (near-field), B (far-field) and C (a non-impacted reference site). Fish were sampled at time (T) T = 0, T = 3 and T = 10 days. Significant increases of CYP1A, one CYP2K1- and two CYP2M1-like proteins were noted at Site A at T = 10 d. For another CYP2K1-like protein, a significant increase was observed at Site A only at T = 3 d. These results support a previous study indicating that CYP1A protein is sensitive to PFW exposure. Importantly, statistically significant environmental induction of both CYP2M1- and CYP2K1-like proteins in tropical fish due to PFW exposure had not previously been described and induction of enzymes in the CYP2 family suggest new biomarkers for PFW. In addition, the novel response of one CYP2K-like protein requires further verification, but offers promise for improved monitoring of sub-lethal responses in marine organisms. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Sea anemones and soft corals were abundant and a total of 133 colonies of L. pertusa were observed. These occurrences and those on the Brent Spar are the first documented reports of live L. pertusa in the North Sea. L. pertusa was restricted in its distribution to water >70 m, below the seasonal thermocline in the northern North Sea. It is estimated that coral sampled from a single point mooring had a linear extension rate of at least 5 mm per year, a rate comparable with existing estimates. It seems likely that these colonies will have originated from populations along the Atlantic margin with larvae transported into the northern North Sea in cooled Atlantic water, possibly via the east Shetland Atlantic Inflow current.

Using 6 yr of data, generalised estimating equations-generalised additive models (GEE-GAMs) were used to investigate if construction-related activity and vessel traffic influenced the occurrence of common dolphin, minke whale, harbour porpoise and grey seal within the area where the pipeline made landfall. Construction-related activity reduced harbour porpoise and minke whale presence, whilst an increase in vessel numbers (independent of construction-related activity) reduced common dolphin presence. All species showed some degree of annual and seasonal variation in occurrence. For common dolphins and harbour porpoises, we found similar seasonal patterns to those reported in broader Irish waters, which tentatively suggests that seasonal patterns persisted irrespective of construction-related activity or vessel traffic, indicating that any impact might have been only short-term. Multiple construction-related activities occurred simultaneously in different areas, and the inter-annual variation may, in part, be an indication of variation in species' re sponse to particular activities, their intensity and their location. However, the precise location of the activities was not regularly recorded, limiting our ability to investigate the fine-scale spatio-temporal impact of the diverse range of construction-related activities.

The Marine Profiling Radiometer (MPR) is designed for operation on a buoy, ship, or for land-based applications. Despite the increased utility of weather forecasts over the past decades, accuracy decreases rapidly as the scale of the weather features decreases and the time range of the forecasts increases. Forecasting the evolution and movement of smaller-scale, short-lived, often intense weather phenomena such as tornadoes, hail storms, and flash floods is less mature than prediction of larger-scale weather systems. This is caused, in part, by inadequate observations. The proposed technology will fill the missing gap in data. Phase I will develop a simplified prototype of MPR to experimentally validate new concepts of ambient calibration, as well as, a self-cleaning mechanism for protection of optical components. The novel calibration approach will enable standalone operation even under extreme weather conditions that can be encountered in harsh marine environments. The major innovation of this all-weather technology is its ability to provide otherwise un-obtainable data in a timely and cost effective manner. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in demonstrating a novel approach to radiometer calibration that could lead to advancement in its use and dramatic improvement in the understanding of the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere, especially in the boundary layer. As 50% of the US population lives within 50 miles of the coast, better information about offshore conditions can have significant economical impact. Improved forecasts will benefit water management of reservoirs/coastal regions, can be used by commercial/military vessels to improve safety and enhance missile guidance system accuracy. MPR data will improve coastal meteorology, improve protection mechanisms and reducing evacuation costs for severe weather events; enhance our understanding of ocean-atmosphere interaction and provide information about regional climate change; reduce the cost associated with offshore wind farm and oil platform operation while improving overall safety; facilitate optimization of the electrical grid improving energy efficiency; enhance weather/dispersion model ensembles for homeland security applications; and provide current weather information to help ensure efficient and environmentally sound sea and port operations for commercial and recreational vessels.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,944622,,,,,,,,"Boulder Environmental Sciences and Technology, LLC","Boulder Environmental Sciences and Technology, LLC",,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13548589,,

We examined the effects of artificial reef depth and reef type on Red Snapper densities and size distributions. We used hook-and-line, fish trap, and scuba visual surveys to estimate Red Snapper densities on four types of artificial reefs: army tanks, pyramids, small reefs (e.g., metal cages, pipelines), and large reefs (e.g., ships, dry docks, oil platforms). Small Red Snapper (<33 cm TL) were significantly more abundant at shallower depths (<35 m) and on small artificial reefs. Army tanks showed significantly more large fish (>33 cm TL) at shallow sites (<35 m) than at deeper sites (>35 m); in contrast, pyramids showed significantly more large fish at deeper sites. Ontogenetic habitat shift and fishing mortality were the most likely factors that would explain these Red Snapper distributions.

The objective of this study was to investigate drivers of seabird habitat selection within the Gulf of the Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries to identify areas for targeted conservation planning. We used seabird abundance data collected by the Applied California Current Ecosystem Studies Program (ACCESS) from 2004-2011. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to model species abundance and distribution as a function of near surface ocean water properties, distances to geographic features and oceanographic climate indices to identify patterns in foraging habitat selection. We evaluated seasonal, inter-annual and species-specific variability of at-sea distributions for the five most abundant seabirds nesting on the Farallon Islands: western gull (Larus occidentalis), common murre (Uria aalge), Cassin's auklet (Ptychorampus aleuticus), rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) and Brandt's cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus). The waters in the vicinity of Cordell Bank and the continental shelf east of the Farallon Islands emerged as persistent and highly selected foraging areas across all species. Further, we conducted a spatial prioritization exercise to optimize seabird conservation areas with and without considering impacts of current human activities. We explored three conservation scenarios where 10, 30 and 50 percent of highly selected, species-specific foraging areas would be conserved. We compared and contrasted results in relation to existing marine protected areas (MPAs) and the future alternative energy footprint identified by the California Ocean Uses Atlas. Our results show that the majority of highly selected seabird habitat lies outside of state MPAs where threats from shipping, oil spills, and offshore energy development remain. This analysis accentuates the need for innovative marine spatial planning efforts and provides a foundation on which to build more comprehensive zoning and management in California's National Marine Sanctuaries.",,,,,,,,,41,1,0,0,35,0,45,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"San Francisco State Univ, Dept Geog, San Francisco, CA 94132 USAPoint Blue Conservat Sci, Petaluma, CA USA",Point Blue Conservat Sci,,,2013-08-13,WOS:000323115800057,23967206,

One of the goals of such environmental assessment studies is to highlight species assemblages and habitat composition that could make the targeted area unique. A section of the Oregon continental slope that had not been previously explored was targeted for the deployment of floating wind turbines. We carried out an underwater video survey, using a towed camera sled, to describe its benthic assemblages. Organisms were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible and assemblages described related to the nature of the seafloor and the depth. We highlighted six invertebrate assemblages and three fish assemblages. For the invertebrates within flat soft sediments areas we defined three different assemblages based on primarily depth: a broad mid-depth (98-315 m) assemblage dominated by red octopus, sea pens and pink shrimps; a narrower mid-depth (250-270 m) assemblage dominated by box crabs and various other invertebrates; and a deeper (310-600 m) assemblage dominated by sea urchins, sea anemones, various snails and zoroasterid sea stars. The invertebrates on mixed sediments also were divided into three different assemblages: a shallow (similar to 100 m deep) assemblage dominated by plumose sea anemones, broad mid-depth (170-370 m) assemblage dominated by sea cucumbers and various other invertebrates; and, again, a narrower mid-depth (230-270 m) assemblage, dominated by crinoids and encrusting invertebrates. For the fish, we identified a rockfish assemblage on coarse mixed sediments at 170-370 m and another fish assemblage on smaller mixed sediments within that depth range (250-370 m) dominated by thornyheads, poachers and flatfishes; and we identified a wide depth-range (98-600 m) fish assemblage on flat soft sediments dominated by flatfishes, eelpouts and thorny heads. Three of these assemblages (the two broad fish assemblages and the deep flat soft sediments invertebrate assemblage) seem to represent deeper examples of assemblages already known on the Oregon continental shelf, especially on soft sediments, while the assemblages in the pockmarks habitat (the narrower depth ranges) might be unique to the area.

Similarly, government officials view fishers as irresponsible and that they overfish. We find that the negative stakeholder image of fishers established in the fish resource conservation discourse is invoked during fishing-petroleum industry conflict resolution processes, in which fishers often have the burden of proof and receive inadequate compensation.

Individual adult northern gannets were equipped with different types of data loggers for several weeks, measuring geographic positions and other parameters mostly at 3-5 min intervals. Birds flew in all directions from the island to search for food, but most flights targeted areas to the (N)NW (north-northwest) of Heligoland. Foraging trips were remarkably variable in duration and distance; most trips lasted 1-15 h and extended from 3 to 80 km from the breeding colony on Heligoland. Dives of gannets were generally shallow, with more than half of the dives only reaching depths of 1-3 m. The maximum dive depth was 11.4 m. Gannets showed a clear diurnal rhythm in their diving activity, with dives being almost completely restricted to the daylight period. Most flight activity at sea occurred at an altitude between the sea surface and 40 m.

At low wind speeds, the dynamics and stability structure of the surface layer depend mainly on the air-sea temperature difference and measured wind speed at a standard height. The physical processes are mostly understood and quantified through Monin-Obukhov (MO) similarity theory. At high wind speeds, different dynamical regimes become dominant, with breaking waves, sea spray, and organized boundary layer convection cells contributing to observed effects. Data from offshore meteorological monitoring sites typically show different behavior and regime shifts depending on the local winds and synoptic conditions. However, the regular methods to interpret time series through spectral analysis only give a partial view of the dynamics in the atmospheric boundary layer. Wind speed and the air-sea temperature difference are important factors that characterize the dynamics of the lower atmospheric boundary layer, and they provide a dynamic and thermodynamic constraint to frame observed processes, especially at high wind speeds. Early studies of long time series of automated offshore meteorological data recognized the value of the joint probability distribution on axes of wind speed and air-sea temperature difference to summarize large segments of the data. The approach can be extended to probe the marine atmospheric boundary layer conditions that are important for the loading of offshore wind turbines: turbulence intensity and wave conditions. The increasing numbers of offshore meteorological masts that are associated with the offshore wind industry are amenable to a similar approach to understand the main characteristics of the boundary layer. In this case, the diagnostic figure provides a method to `fingerprint' the atmospheric conditions at an offshore site. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Britain also holds internationally important populations of many species of seabirds. Impacts of marine renewables on seabird populations are uncertain. All breeding seabird species in the UK are protected by EU law with over 80 Special Protection Areas designated in the UK for seabirds, representing a potential constraint on offshore renewables development, as cumulative impacts could at some point exceed legal thresholds. There is an urgent need to develop a tool to assess cumulative impacts of renewables on seabird populations, to assist developers and regulators to refine assessment of impacts of renewables on seabird populations. This project will address that urgent need. The student will work with academic and industrial supervisors and with scientific staff of the statutory nature conservation bodies (SNCBs) and regulators to develop a population viability analysis (PVA)-based population modelling approach that recognises the meta-population structure of seabird populations, their seasonal migrations and overlap of different international regional populations, and the concept of biologically defined minimum population scales (BDMPS) being promoted by SNCBs. The modelling approach will use the detailed demographic data available for most seabird species and combine that with the high quality colony census data available for seabirds in the UK. Assessments of the impacts of collision mortality and displacement by marine renewables will be coupled with the PVA model to project likely future dynamics. This modelling will assess projected population level impacts of marine renewables at an appropriate spatial scale (regions of the UK marine area or the whole of UK waters depending on the seabird species), with the consequences of impacts partitioned by season (since populations at risk differ among seasons).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1658613,,,,,,,,University of Glasgow,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15389078,,

Concern over the potential impact of offshore wind energy on sea duck populations has led to efforts to develop models to understand their distribution, habitat use, and site fidelity. We used satellite telemetry to document winter phenology and site fidelity, as well as fine-scale resource selection and habitat use, of 40 White-winged Scoters along the southern New England continental shelf. Scoters spent over half of the annual cycle on the wintering grounds and demonstrated a high degree of interannual site fidelity to composite core-use areas.

More than half of all tagged birds occupied 2 or more discrete core-use areas that were up to 400 km apart. Throughout the study area, scoters selected areas with lower salinity, lower sea surface temperature, higher chlorophyll-a concentrations, and higher hard-bottom substrate probability.

The service life of marine assets is heavily influenced by the involvement of numerous material degradation processes (such as fatigue cracking, corrosion and pitting) as well as environmental stresses that vary with geographic locations and climatic factors. The composition of seawater constituents (e. g. dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature content, etc.) is one of the major influencing factors in degradation of marine assets. Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance management strategies can have a significant impact on operational availability and reliability of marine assets. Many research studies have been conducted over the past few decades to predict the degradation behaviour of marine structures operating under different environmental conditions. The utilisation of structural degradation data - particularly on marine corrosion - can be very useful in developing a reliable, risk-free and cost-effective maintenance strategy. This paper presents an overview of the state-of-the-art and future trends in asset maintenance management strategies applied to corroded steel structures in extreme marine environments. The corrosion prediction models as well as industry best practices on maintenance of marine steel structures are extensively reviewed and analysed.

The biota of these previously unstudied areas and to three high-relief features in deeper water was observed during May 1980 using a combination of diver reconnaissance, videotape surveys, still-camera photography, and collection of invertebrates for identification. The six hardbottom sites in shallow water typically comprised, small, often patchy, rock outcrops, and the associated sessile invertebrates included hydroids, bryozoans, sponges, octocorals, and ahermatypic stony corals. Sea urchins and arrow crabs were the most common motile epifauna. Fish assemblages were typified by red snapper, Atlantic spadefish, blue runner, gray triggerfish, sheepshead, and tomtate. Three deeper stations had many of the same fish and invertebrate species, but also possessed a more tropical assemblage including fire corals, antipatharians, spiny lobsters, and a variety of tropical fish species. Hermatypic corals characteristic of some large, offshore banks were not abundant at any of the sites. Differences in the composition of fish assemblages between nearshore and deeper stations parallel those previously observed at petroleum platforms in the area. Shallow-water stations presumably experience a greater seasonal temperature range and lower absolute temperatures in winter and may be exposed to stresses such as lowered salinity and depleted oxygen levels due to their relative proximity to Mississippi River discharge.

Macroalgal assemblages had similar structure between years. Neither critical decrease in abundance of the dominant macroalgae, nor increase in opportunistic species were found. Some differences in abundance were observed, but they did not show any pattern, being more likely the result of the natural variability of the assemblage.

Nevertheless, extracting ecologically relevant information from a large amount of raw images remains a time-consuming and somewhat laborious challenge. Thus, underwater imagery processing needs to strike a compromise between time-efficient image annotation and accuracy in quantifying benthic community composition. Designing and implementing robust image sampling and image annotation protocols are therefore critical to rationally address these trade-offs between ecological accuracy and processing time. The aim of this study was to develop and to optimize a reliable image scoring strategy based on the point count method using imagery data acquired on tide-swept macroepibenthic communities. Using a stepwise approach, we define an underwater imagery processing protocol that is effective in terms of (i) time allocated to overall image, (ii) reaching a satisfactory accuracy to estimate the occurrence of dominant benthic taxa, and (iii) adopting a sufficient taxonomic resolution to describe changes in community composition. We believe that our method is well adapted to investigate the composition of epibenthic communities on artificial reefs and can be useful in surveying colonization of other human structures (wind turbine foundations, pipelines, etc.) in coastal areas. Our strategy meets the increasing demand for inexpensive and time-effective tools for monitoring changes in benthic communities in a context of increasing coastal artificialization pressures.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,11,0,12,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"France Energies Marines, 525 Ave Alexis de Rochon, F-29280 Plouzane, FranceIFREMER, Ctr Bretagne, DYNECO Lab Ecol Benth, ZI Pointe Diable, CS 10070, F-29280 Plouzane, FranceIFREMER, Lab Environm Ressources Bretagne Nord, 38 Rue Port Blanc, F-35801 Dinard, FranceIFREMER, Ctr Bretagne, Direct Commun Pole Audiovisuel, ZI Pointe Diable, CS 10070, F-29280 Plouzane, FranceIFREMER, Ctr Bretagne, Lab Comportement Struct Mer, ZI Pointe Diable, CS 10070, F-29280 Plouzane, France",France Energies Marines,,,2020-03-01,WOS:000536430100033,,

Compared to migratory birds and other more conspicuous migrants, we know very little about the movement patterns of many migratory bats. Hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus), a cryptic, wide-ranging, long-distance migrant, comprise a substantial proportion of the tens to hundreds of thousands of bat fatalities estimated to occur each year at wind turbines in North America. We created seasonally-dynamic species distribution models (SDMs) from 2,753 museum occurrence records collected over five decades in North America to better understand the seasonal geographic distributions of hoary bats. We used 5 SDM approaches: logistic regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, boosted regression trees, random forest, and maximum entropy and consolidated outputs to generate ensemble maps. These maps represent the first formal hypotheses for sex-and season-specific hoary bat distributions. Our results suggest that North American hoary bats winter in regions with relatively long growing seasons where temperatures are moderated by proximity to oceans, and then move to the continental interior for the summer. SDMs suggested that hoary bats are most broadly distributed in autumn-the season when they are most susceptible to mortality from wind turbines; this season contains the greatest overlap between potentially suitable habitat and wind energy facilities. Comparing wind-turbine fatality data to model outputs could test many predictions, such as 'risk from turbines is highest in habitats between hoary bat summering and wintering grounds'. Although future field studies are needed to validate the SDMs, this study generated well-justified and testable hypotheses of hoary bat migration patterns and seasonal distribution.",,,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,33,0,43,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Colorado, Dept Integrat Biol, Denver, CO 80204 USAUS Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA",,,,2015-07-24,WOS:000358622000034,26208098,

Coastal residents reported higher levels of acceptability and support than non-coastal residents. Pulling from innovation theory, we show that levels of support depended upon the development lifecycle stage of the technology.

Marine environments are subjected to artificial lighting from coastal development, in addition to offshore sources, such as fishing vessels, oil platforms and cruise ships. Fish species that rely on nearshore habitats are most significantly impacted by coastal light pollution, as they are often limited to nearshore habitats due to predation risk in deeper offshore waters, particularly as juveniles. Juvenile bonefish [Albula vulpes (Linnaeus, 1758)] inhabit the nearshore environment, and are therefore exposed to coastal lighting and other watershed development impacts. Here, we assessed juvenile bonefish behavior and physiology in the presence of two common light sources: constant street lighting (high pressure sodium) and intermittent car headlights (H4 halogen). The behavioral responses were compared with a night and day control, whereas physiology was compared only with a night control. Each behavioral trial had two time periods: light and recovery (2 hrs each). Physiology (blood glucose and whole body cortisol) was assessed after an overnight 8-hr exposure. The results suggest that there is no effect of light pollution on the swimming behavior or whole body cortisol of juvenile bonefish, but that both forms of light pollution resulted in elevated blood glucose concentrations (a simple stress indicator) relative to controls, with constant light glucose levels being significantly higher.

To evaluate the impact of oil related activities in the ocean floor sediments, we analyzed the geochemical (major and trace element, organic carbon and hydrocarbon concentrations) and biological (benthic foraminifera) composition of 62 superficial sediment samples, from 13 to 1336 m water depth. Cluster and Factor analysis of all the variables indicate that their distribution patterns are mainly controlled by differences between the ter-rigenous and carbonate platforms in the SGoM. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages were abundant and diverse, and their distribution patterns are mainly determined by water depth and sedimentary environment. However, most of the abundant species are opportunistic and/or low-oxygen tolerant, and many of their tests show oil stains and infillings, characteristic of oil polluted locations, suggesting the environment has been modified by natural seepage or oil-related activities. To determine if these conditions are natural or anthropogenic in origin, pre - industrial settings should be studied. Organic carbon (Corg) content (0.6-2.9%) and total hydrocarbon concentrations (PAHs 1.0-29.5 mu g kg(-1)) were usually higher around the oil platforms area, the natural hydrocarbon seeps (chapopoteras) area and offshore rivers, but there is no accumulation of oil related trace elements in these areas. However, the comparison with international sediment quality benchmarks indicates that Cd, Cr and Ni concentrations are above the threshold effect level, and also As, Ba and Cu are above the probable effect level benchmarks, which indicate that these element concentrations might be of potential ecological concern.

Renewable energy will play a vital role in meeting this demand whilst maintaining global climate change targets. Around the British Isles, development of wind farms has entered Round three, with large, high capacity wind parks being planned to enhance energy security and achieve 2020 renewable energy targets. Such developments place additional pressure on existing sea space and may result in conflicts with other marine activities and users. Co-location of certain activities, marine protected areas, aquaculture and commercial fishing in particular, has therefore been proposed as an option to ease demands on space. Using the UK guided by EU and regional policy, as a case study, following the criteria-based planning system, co-location is legally feasible. Crucially, co-location options will depend on site specific characteristics and site management plans. The biology, ecology and hydrology of the site as well as consideration of important commercial and economic factors will be determining factors of success. For marine protected areas compatibility with conservation objectives for the site will be fundamental. Where possible, it is suggested that activities suitable for co-location will develop in tandem with renewable energy projects. The importance of developing joint projects in this manner is particularly true for aquaculture projects to ensure tenure security and commercial viability. Adaptive management will be a basis for evolution of the concept and practice of co-location. Pilot projects and continued monitoring will be essential in shaping the future of co-location of activities. As the Marine Management Organisation continues the development of marine plans for the English inshore and offshore waters, a study into potential solutions for resolving sea use conflicts is timely. This paper therefore provides a concise overview of the current regulation affecting co-location of key marine activities within wind farm zones and provides suggestions on how co-location projects can be adopted and taken forward, using the UK as a case study.
