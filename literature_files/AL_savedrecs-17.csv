Two different methods, floating and vortex, were employed to promote the interaction of four oil samples with different API (e.g., 10, 20, 28 and 45) spilled on seawater and deionized water with three magnetic materials, namely: magnetite nanoparticles (N); magnetic nanocomposites of yeast biomass provided by ethanol industry (Y); and magnetic nanocomposites of cork powder (C). The magnetic nanomaterials exposed to oil on water were taking out by a neodymium magnet, and the oil recoveries were determined by gravimetric analysis before and after lyophilization. The lyophilization was determinant to guarantee the accuracy of the experiments, and without this step, the masses of oil recovered would be overestimated due to the drag of water during the oil and magnetic material removal process. Three main factors, API, contact method and magnetic material, and two interactions (i.e., API x contact method, and contact method x magnetic material) presented a statistically significant effect on oil recovery. It was observed that oil recovery increases as API decreases, and it was possible to establish a model to predict the amount of recovered oil according to this effect. Higher oil recoveries were also obtained by magnetic nanocomposites of yeast biomass (Y), regardless of the contact method and type of water, recoveries of 23% and 100% for 45 and 10 API, respectively, employing around 20 mg of Y on 300 mg of spilled oil. These percentages correspond to 0.29 +/- 0.01 kg/kg and 15.98 kg/kg of recovering oil by the magnetic procedure. The increase of mass of magnetic material improved the recovery of oils with higher APIs.

Dilbit exposure is known to cause adverse effects in fish, but linking molecular and cellular changes with ecologically-relevant individual performance metrics is needed to better understand the potential consequences of a dilbit spill into the aquatic environment. Therefore, this study examined the effects of dilbit exposure on subcellular responses in cardiac and skeletal muscle in relation to swimming performance in a migratory fish species at risk of exposure, Atlantic salmon. Smolts were exposed subchronically to environmentally relevant concentrations of the water-soluble fraction of dilbit (WSFd) for 24 d, and then a subset of exposed fish underwent a depuration period of 7 or 14 d, for a total of 3 experimental time points. At each time point, repeat swimming performance was assessed using sequential critical swimming speed tests (U-crit) separated by a 24 h rest period, and then several tissues were collected to determine biotransformation enzyme activation, energetic responses, and gene expression changes. U-crit was unaffected in fish exposed to 67.9 mu g/L total initial polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC), but fish showed a decreased reliance on lipid metabolism for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the heart that was maintained through 7 d depuration. In contrast, U-crit increased in fish exposed to 9.65 mu g/L PAC, corresponding to an increased reliance on anaerobic metabolic pathways in cardiac and red skeletal muscle, with partial recovery after 7 d depuration. As expected, at both concentrations WSFd hepatic cyp 1A-mediated biotransformation reactions increased, as measured by EROD activity, which remained elevated for 7 d but not after 14 d depuration. Transcript abundance of cyp1a was also increased in muscle tissue and recovered by 14 d depuration. The expression of other stress-related genes increased in white muscle of dilbit-exposed fish, but were largely unchanged in cardiac and red muscle. The transcriptional profile of cardiac tissue was compared to that of sockeye salmon similarly exposed to WSFd in a previous experiment, and is provided in supplemental text. Combined, these results demonstrate that dilbit exposure alters gene expression and enzyme activities related to xenobiotic exposure, cellular stress, and muscle energetics in juvenile Atlantic salmon without impairing swimming performance, and that most of these changes are recoverable within 14 d depuration.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,9,0,13,,,0166-445X,1879-1514,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, CanadaSimon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC, CanadaUniv British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, CanadaUniv British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Vancouver, BC, Canada",,,,2020-04-27,WOS:000526050100007,32006756,
J,,,,,,,,,"Yaroslavtsev,Andrey",,The development of new types of ion-exchange membranes and their usage in alternative energy devices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 1800,2017,"The needs of modern civilization in energy are constantly growing. Today, the most part of this energy is produced by burning of fossil fuels: oil, gas and coal. However this method of energy production leads to pollution of the environment by carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur oxides, and incomplete combustion products. Therefore, the world community pays more attention to the search for alternative, especially renewable, energy sources. In this series, the leading positions clear belong to solar and wind energy. However their usage is limited by significant instability of power generation. If solar energy diurnal oscillation can easily be compensated by using of batteries, then at winter conditions their use is inefficient due to high spontaneous discharge of the batteries. Hence, many expectations are laid on the hydrogen energy with the reproduction of energy by oxidation of hydrogen in the fuel cells. Moreover, hydrogen has the maximum power capacity, and fuel cells do not pollute the environment because energy and water are the only products. Taking in the account high fuel efficiency (depending on the operating mode the efficiency is 50-90%) it makes extremely perspective the usage of fuel cells as electric power supplies for various vehicles operating either in large population centers, or, conversely, under conditions where refueling is not possible (submarines, drones, etc.). In addition, combination of fuel cells with solar panels becomes more and more popular for power supply of cottages. Substantial attention is now also paid to so-called reverse electrodialysis in which energy is generated by mixing of salt and fresh water. It is believed that the usage of just this process will be the key energy sourse in coastal areas. The key element in both devices is the ion-exchange membrane, which provides energy generation by selective directed ion transport under action of the electrochemical gradient. Perfluorinated sulfonic acid membranes of the Nafion type are the most suitable for use in fuel cells. Russian analogue of Nafion membranes is MF-4SK developed by Plastpolymer (St. Petersburg). However, the commercial production of this ionomer is stopped. The Company now cells the old stocks, and the quality of the product is markedly deteriorated inferior to quality of Nafion type membranes. Within the framework of the project, it is proposed to develop new methods of preparation of the high-quality products. These methods include the production of appropriate monomer, copolymers, and membranes. In particular, it is proposed to prepare high molecular weight copolymers that will lead to increase in both their strength and chemical stability (due to reduction of end groups content). It is also proposed to prepare the copolymers with high ion-exchange capacity responsible for proton conductivity and water uptake of the membranes, while preserving acceptable strength characteristics. It should be mentioned that even Nafion membranes are not ideal for their usage in fuel cells. The main reason is failure to operate at elevated temperatures. This makes it impossible to use comparatively cheap hydrogen produced by conversion of natural gas or alcohols without deep purification from CO traces. Carbon monooxide irreversibly poisons platinum catalyst at the temperature up to 120 °C. Another significant problem is the need for additional moistening of the gases to ensure high conductivity of the membranes. This significantly complicates the design of fuel cells, increases their cost, and leads to the danger of flooding of catalytic layers at temperature fluctuations. The solution of these problems consists in preparation of hybrid membranes containing nanosized inorganic additives, such as silica, etc. In our recent studies, it has been shown that the membrane modification by heteropoly acid salts allows significantly increasing in fuel cells performance which at 60RH exceeds the performance of fuel cell based on Nafion at 100RH. In this case, the greatest effect was achieved by using of nanoparticles modified with acidic groups, for example, sulfonated zirconium oxide, silicon oxide with adsorbed acidic salts of heteropolyacids, etc. In addition, it is very promising to create asymmetric membranes with increased conductivity and reduced gas permeability. It is also important that the Nafion membranes used in fuel cells are very expensive, that significantly increases the cost of fuel cells. For many applications, the high cost is compensated by the high stability of perfluorinated polymer backbone. But for a number of applications it is desirable to use the cheaper membranes. In our opinion, the usage of graft polymer membranes can be very advantageous in this sense. The production of such membranes consists in the treatment of avalaible hydrocarbon polymer films (polyethylene, polypropylene, etc.) by high-energy irradiation. The radicals generated in the polymer matrix are quite stable and can be used for graft polymerization of styrene. The obtained polymer can be easily sulfonated, which results in peparation of membranes having high proton conductivity and ion transfer selectivity. We have recently shown that these membranes turned out to be highly selective and can be used as electrolyte in reverse electrodialysis. However, there are a lot of problems related with the preparation of a polymer with a uniform distribution of functional groups, the selection of optimal starting polymers and the methods for their activation. So, some polymer matrix allow usage of UV-radiation or thermal activation instead of X-ray, which can greatly simplify the process of production of the grafted membranes. On the other hand, perfluorinated or partially fluorinated or chlorinated membranes are more preferable because of its enhanced stability. Finally, by varying the synthesis conditions, it is possible to obtain membranes with a wide range of polystyrene content and, accordingly, of sulfo groups content. This significantly affects the conductive, and mechanical properties of the membranes and their chemical stability. The choice of appropriate methods and synthesis conditions ensuring an optimal combination of these properties is of fundamental importance for the subsequent use of these materials in alternative energy sources. As for Nafion-type membranes the modification methods will be developed to improve their transport properties. Finally, the resulting membranes with the best characteristics will be tested in fuel cells and in reverse electrodialysis devices. Thus, the purpose of this work is to obtain a wide range of membranes based on perfluorinated, grafted and hybrid materials and to produce and test the electrochemical power sources on their basis.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,17-79-30054,,,,,,,,Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics of Russian Academy of Sciences,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15291298,,

Changes under a range of cropping and grazing farming systems in eastern Australia,,,,,,,,GEODERMA,,,,265,,,,164,175,,,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2015.11.005,,,,,,,Article,MAR 1 2016,2016,"The level of soil organic carbon (SOC) that is attained under agriculture largely depends upon rates of carbon input and its decomposition under various agronomic practises such as stubble (crop residue) management and fertiliser application. In this study, we used the APSIM-Wheat and APSIM-Agpasture models to simulate changes in SOC in a range of crop and pasture management systems across nine locations in eastern Australia. We explored the extent to which various crop and pasture management options affect changes in SOC from a sub-tropical to a temperate environment. Specifically, we examined how nitrogen fertilisation, stubble management and stocking rate affect SOC and what strategies might be employed by farmers to increase SOC sequestration across eastern Australia. We modelled a continuous cropping regime, a continuously grazed pasture and a mixed cropping and pasture rotation. Under continuous cropping higher nitrogen application and higher amounts of stubble incorporation increased the SOC levels at all locations. At Roma, the northern-most site, there was little additional gain in SOC from increasing N above 70 kg N ha(-1) whereas most other sites showed benefits above 70 kg N ha(-1). The biggest factor in boosting SOC under cropping was the level of stubble incorporation. At all but one site, continuously grazed pasture generally resulted in SOC increases over the 60 years. However, increasing stocking rate decreased the rates of SOC changes at all sites. Crop-pasture rotations show that the impacts of even 4 years of pasture is likely to be significant in reducing declining SOC at low nitrogen application during cropping phases. N fertilisation and stubble incorporation reduced the impact of stocking rate by reducing the decline in SOC. The difference in SOC changes between nine sites across eastern Australia was largely described by mean temperature and rainfall but high temperature strongly interacted with management practises (stocking rate, N application and residue incorporation) to reduce the sequestration of C despite favourable rainfall. Our results indicate that a mean annual temperature higher than about 20 degrees C can switch a soil from net sink into a net source of atmospheric CO2 if other factors affecting soil carbon changes such as stubble incorporation, stocking rate and site rainfall are constant.

This paper presents a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based approach to describe the behavior of underwater gas release and dispersion from subsea gas pipelines leak. The uniqueness of the present study is the integration of estimating subsea gas release rate and predicting rising gas plume. The proposed approach is comprised of two submodels. An equivalent short pipeline model is established to calculate the subsea gas release rate, considering the change of hole size and environmental pressure. A 3D model based on Eulerian-Lagrangian modeling concept is built to predict the rising gas plume, in which bubbles are treated as discrete particles. The validation is carried out by comparing CFD results against experimental data. The underwater gas dispersion simulations include a matrix of scenarios for different gas release rates, water depths, ocean current speeds and leak positions, to study their effects on the behavior of underwater gas plume. The developed CFD model can provide some valuable outputs, e.g., gas release rate, rise time, horizontal dispersion distance and surfacing area size. These results could help to conduct the risk assessment and the emergency planning for accidental leakage of subsea gas pipelines. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Thus, to eliminate the possibility of future energy shortage, efforts are directed for the development of alternative energy sources which are cheaper to produce, biodegradable, non-toxic and renewable. Currently, nearly all renewable energy sources (hydroelectric, solar, wind, tidal, geothermal) target the electricity market, while fuels make up a much larger share of global energy demand. Biofuels are therefore, rapidly being developed. Microalgae have the advantages that they can produce a wide range of feedstocks for the production of biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane and biohydrogen. Biodiesel is currently produced from the oil synthesized by conventional fuel crops that harvest the sun's energy and store it as chemical energy. Producing biodiesel from algae is widely regarded as one of the most efficient ways of generating biofuels and appears to represent the only current renewable source of oil that could meet the global demand for transport fuels. Different microalgae having potential for the biofuel production are Scenedesmus, Pleurochrysis, Dunaliella, Spirulina, Chlorella etc. The main advantages of these are their a) Higher photosynthetic efficiency b) Faster growth and larger biomass c) Easy mass culture d) Easily controllable environmental conditions e) Round the year production d) Non polluting and environment friendly e) No net contribution to atmospheric CO2 levels f) Production reported to be 15000 gallons oil / acre / year g) Bio-oil from microalgae is rich in carbon and hydrogen as compared to wood but little less than fossil oil h) Algal oil contains No Sulphur and i) Microalgae also contain carbohydrates and protein. Microalgae contain lipids and fatty acids as membrane components, storage products, metabolites and sources of energy. Algal fatty acids and oils have a range of potential applications and algal oils possess characteristics similar to those of fish and vegetable oils, and can thus, are considered as potential substitutes for the products of fossil oil. After processing for biofuel, rest is good enough as animal feed or can be processed for ethanol production. Although micro algal biofuel production is relatively new and not very well explored, however, several aspects of this novel approach of using microalgae for biofuel is an interesting development. The unparalleled space efficiency of growing algae for biodiesel production gives it a major advantage over established biofuel production methods. With the ever increasing demand for arable land, not only because of biofuel demand, but also because of growing food consumption worldwide, it may become very hard to continue using cheap and well established oil crops such as corn and soy. In this respect, especially the potential of algae to be grown on non-arable land or on the sea is of great importance for energy production in the future. Taking all advantages together, including no fresh water requirements, carbon sequestration options, waste water treatment, algal biofuel may well be a prominent player of the future energy market.The new and broad field of microalgal biofuel production seems to be very promising apprach for meeting ever increasing biofuel demands.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,978-93-80012-44-5,,,,,,,,,"Indian Agr Res Inst, Ctr Conservat & Utilisat Blue Green Algae, New Delhi 110012, India",,,,2012-04-06,WOS:000287046700016,,

According to the literature survey, this proposal has not been considered before. Since fresh water production can be easily stored, the key issue in designing SeaWater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) desalination plants is to minimise the capital cost required per m(3) of fresh water produced throughout the plant lifetime. In addition, water cost of renewable energy - driven desalination strongly depends on decisions concerning battery capacity and nominal power installed, thus hybrid systems play and important role in this regard. The energy analysis performed quantifies the temporal complementarity of tidal and solar resources in an exemplary case study of a semiarid plant location at Broome, Australia. An estimation of the yearly energy production profile of the tidal range power plant is calculated with a zero-dimensional numerical model whereas the System Advisor Model (SAM) is used for the solar PV plant. The main result obtained is the great temporary complementarity of tidal and solar photovoltaic resources for SWRO application. For a given size of the PV generator the inclusion of the tidal range power plant implies an increase of the operating time of the desalination plant at nominal capacity between 1.8 and 2.8 times compared to the only solar PV driven case. This result depends on the SWRO nominal capacity. The recommended design for the case study consists in off-grid desalination plants, with minimum battery capacity if any, powered by a hybrid energy system with a ratio of installed desalination capacities of 55.10(3) m(3)/d per each hydraulic turbine of 10 MW.

Vibrational action is one of the most simple and efficient tools for controlling the stability of inhomogeneous hydrodynamical systems. That is why the study of the influence of vibrations on such systems is important from both the fundamental and technological points of view. Within the framework of the project it is planned to investigate - the impact of the vertical and tangential vibrations on the stability of a two-layer systems in the presence of the surface tension dependence on the temperature; - the behavior of nonlinearly-viscous and viscoplastic fluids in vibrational fields; - the effect of vibrations on the behavior of heterogeneous binary mixtures of two miscible liquids with different molecular structure; - the dynamics of the ensemble of solid particles suspended in a liquid and subjected to horizontal vibrations. The importance of these studies is related to their various technical applications and lack of knowledge on the phenomena, which are proposed to be studied. Vibration effects can be utilized for separation of different phases in a heterogeneous environment, specifically, in suspensions, emulsions, and petroleum pitches. In the pharmaceutical industry and oil refinery industry, the techniques of the separation of phases in suspensions and emulsions still requires further improvements. The problem of separation of heterogeneous systems is relevant not only for the industrial applications, but also for environmental problems. Within the framework of the project the problems associated with the investigation and development of techniques for control of filtration through porous medium are as well proposed to be considered; specifically, it is planned - to study the effect of the finite frequency modulation on convection in a non-uniformly heated porous medium saturated with a binary mixture with Soret effect; - to simulate the effect of a periodic action on the dynamics of the displacement front and the phase interfaces in porous media; - to explore the characteristics of the hydrodynamic mechanisms of the transfer of mass, momentum and heat through the interface between fluids and porous media; - to study the process of the filtering of a mixture, taking into account the effects of settling and separation of the solid particles of admixtures from the matrix of the porous medium. The importance of these problems is primarily associated to the development of production techniques maximizing the efficiency of extraction of hydrocarbons from the deposits. Another set of problems important for the oil- and gas- extraction and refinery industries is related to the effect of thermal diffusion in mixtures. Specifically, the hydrocarbon deposits are formed by multicomponent mixtures saturating the porous medium. The thermal diffusion effect has a significant control over the distribution of the components of the mixture and is important for an efficient processing of hydrocarbon deposits. Within the framework of this topic, it is planned - to investigate the nonlinear regimes of convection of ternary mixtures with Soret effect in rectangular cavity filled with a porous medium; - to study the heat- and mass-transfer processes in ternary mixtures in a plane horizontal layer heated from below, taking into account the effect of thermal diffusion. Additionally to the vibration-related techniques of control, an efficient method of controlling hydrodynamical systems is exposure to alternating electric and magnetic fields. These techniques of control of hydrodynamical systems are planned to be considered in the following problems: - the study of the influence of inhomogeneity of wetting on oscillations of the drops of a low-viscosity liquid drops in the alternating electric field; - investigation of the influence of the running magnetic field on the processes of the crystal growth from the semiconductor melt. The importance of the problem of crystallization is determined by the demand of the modern semiconductor industry in a semiconductor single crystals of a required chemical composition with low defect density and uniform distribution of dopants. The electrowetting finds its applications in microfluidics for manufacturing devices that are used for testing the quality of water and medical diagnostics. It is also planned to study the mechanisms of instability in two-layer systems of nonisothermal immiscible fluids in the presence of phase transition localized at the interface. Two cases of a localized phase transition are to be considered: (i) the case of vapor film boiling of the liquid subject to sub-cooling, and (ii) the case of interfacial boiling of a two-layer system of immiscible liquids at the temperature below the bulk boiling temperature of each component. For the first case, it is planned to study the nonlinear regimes of stabilization and the decay of the vapor film in the course of the horizontal sub-cooled vapor film boiling. In Project 2014, the suppression of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability by a phase transition was considered from the first principles within the framework of a linear approach. Earlier, nonlinear solutions were studied by another authors on the basis of the lubrication approximation and assumptions of inviscid liquids and thermodynamic quasi-equilibrium. A rigorous analysis of nonlinear effects will complement the results of the linear theory and approximate approaches to accounting of the non-linearity. For the second case, it is planned to study the influence of the interfacial boiling of the direct contact between two immiscible liquids on the process of combustion of a light fuel spilled on top of a heavy inflammable liquid. From the viewpoint of physics, the problem is interesting because the process of interfacial boiling of the direct contact between two immiscible liquids occurs at a temperature which is lower than the bulk boiling temperatures of each component. The importance of the studies in the first case is related to the fact that the boiling of this kind occurs during hardening and cooling of high-energy technical devices. The relevance of the study for the second case is related to the anthropogenic catastrophes, accompanied by oil spills and their ignition. Several project problems are related to the low-viscosity fluid flows. In this regard, the important question is the one of the correctness of the mathematical description of such systems in real-world situations where the turbulent boundary layer should be formed in the near-wall regions. Within the framework of the project, the study of currents and surface waves in low-viscosity liquids with account for the turbulent viscosity is proposed. In particular, in connection with the internal waves in natural water bodies (oceans, areas of river confluence, etc.), the problem of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the presence of turbulent viscosity is of particular interest. The specificity of an accurate account for the turbulent viscosity is that it is inhomogeneous in space and vanishingly small in the vicinity of the interfaces.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,17-21-00011,,,,,,,,Institute of Continuous Media Mechanics Ural Branch Russian Academy of Sciences,Institute of Continuous Media Mechanics Ural Branch Russian Academy of Sciences,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15291835,,

Deep fluids from geothermal reservoirs along the Transmexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) are characterized by elevated arsenic concentrations, within a range between 1 and 100 mg L-1 at a depth from 600 to 3000 m b.s.l. Based on hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), arsenic is linked to typical geothermal species like lithium, silica, and boron. The lack of correlation between arsenic and salinity reflects the importance of secondary water-rock interaction processes. The predominance of arsenic compared to Fe- and Cu-concentrations, and the occurrence of secondary minerals (sulfides and clay minerals) in temperature-dependent hydrothermal zones, supports this hypothesis. Neither magmatic fluids input, nor As mineralization is a prerequisite for As enrichment in Mexican geothermal fluids. In contrast, petroleum reservoir waters from sedimentary basins in SE-Mexico show maximum As concentrations of 2 mg L-1, at depths from 2900 to 6100 m b.s.l. The linear chloride-arsenic correlation indicates that evaporated seawater represents the major source for aqueous arsenic in oil reservoirs, and only minor arsenic proportions are derived from interaction with carbonate host rock. Speciation modeling suggests the lack of arsenic solubility control in both geothermal and petroleum reservoirs, but precipitation/co-precipitation of As with secondary sulfides could occur in petroleum reservoirs with high iron concentrations. Geothermal fluids from magmatic-type reservoirs (Los Azufres and Los Humeros at the TMVB and Las Tres Virgenes with a granodioritic basement) show relative constant arsenic concentrations through varying temperature conditions, which indicates that temperatures above 230-250 C provide optimal and stable conditions for arsenic mobility. In contrast, temperature conditions for sedimentary-type reservoirs are irrelevant for water-rock interaction processes, as suggested by low arsenic aqueous concentration for both Cerro Prieto geothermal fluids (high temperature - sedimentary type) and oil field formation water (low temperature - sedimentary type).

Conventional treatment methods of PRW are energy intensive, and thus there is an urgent need to develop sustainable technologies. Microbial desalination cells (MDCs) represent a new energy-efficient technology for simultaneous treatment of PRW and seawater. In this study, PRW was for the first time treated in an MDC and the effects of salt concentration and catholyte were studied. The maximum COD removal was achieved by the MDC using an initial salt concentration of 20 g/L NaCI solution, and the COD removal increased slightly from 64.0% to 70.5% when the catholyte was changed from phosphate buffer solution (PBS) to acidified water. The maximum desalination efficiency of 19.9% was obtained by an MDC operated with real seawater and PBS. Acidified water was found to be an efficient catholyte in terms of specific energy production. When desalinating real seawater, the highest total energy produced was 32.6 Wh/kg COD with respect to COD removal or 9.5 Wh/m(3) with respect to the total volume of the desalinated water. These results demonstrated that complex PRW could be used as an anodic substrate in MDCs for electricity generation and seawater desalination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, heavy oil is known to degrade slowly due to its hydrophobicity. Therefore, microorganisms capable of producing biosurfactants are gaining substantial interest because of their potential to alter hydrocarbon properties and thereby speed up the degradation process. In this study, six bacterial consortia were obtained from the oil-spilled beach areas in Miyagi, Japan, and all of which exhibited high potential in degrading heavy oil measured by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed that the diverse microbial community in each consortium changed with subculture and became stable with a few effective microorganisms after 15 generations. The total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) degradation ability of the consortia obtained from a former gas station (C1: 81%) and oil refinery company (C6: 79%) was higher than that of the consortia obtained from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) (C3: 67%, and C5: 73%), indicating that bacteria present in C1 and C6 were historically exposed to petroleum hydrocarbons. Moreover, it was intriguing that the consortium C4, also obtained from WWTP, exhibited high TPH degradation ability (77%). The NGS results revealed that two bacteria,Achromobactersp. andOchrobactrumsp., occupied more than 99% of the consortium C4, while noPseudomonassp. was found in C4, though this bacterium was observed in other consortia and is also known to be a potential candidate for TPH degradation as reported by previous studies. In addition, the consortium C4 showed high biosurfactant-producing ability among the studied consortia. To date, no study has reported the TPH degradation by the combination ofAchromobactersp. andOchrobactrumsp.; therefore, the consortium C4 provided an excellent opportunity to study the interaction of and biosurfactant production by these two bacteria during TPH degradation.",,,,,,,,,11,0,1,0,6,0,11,,,,2077-1312,,,,,,,,,,"Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Aoba Ku, 6-6-20 Aoba, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, JapanAgcy Assessment & Applicat Technol BPPT, Puspiptek Serpong 15314, Tangerang Selat, Indonesia",,,,2020-09-25,WOS:000568600900001,,

We present a four-year dataset to characterize the temporal evolution of various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their alkylated homologs trapped in the residual oil buried along the shoreline. Field samples analyzed include the first arrival oil collected from Perdido Bay, Alabama in June 2010, and multiple oil spill samples collected until August 2014. Our field data show that, as of August 2014, DWH oil is still trapped along Alabama's beaches as submerged oil, predominately in the form of surface residual oil balls (SRBs). Chemical characterization data show that various PAHs present in the spilled oil (MC252 crude) weathered by about 45% to 100% when the oil was floating over the open ocean system in the Gulf of Mexico. Light PAHs, such as naphthalenes, were fully depleted, whereas heavy PAHs, such as chrysenes, were only partially depleted by about 45%. However, the rate of PAH weathering appears to have decreased significantly once the oil was buried within the partially-closed SRB environment. Concentration levels of several heavy PAHs have almost remained constant over the past 4 years. Our data also show that evaporation was most likely the primary weathering mechanism for PAH removal when the oil was floating over the ocean, although photo-degradation and other physico-chemical processes could have contributed to some additional weathering. Chemical data presented in this study indicate that submerged oil containing various heavy PAHs (for example, parent and alkylated chrysenes) is likely to remain in the beach system for several years. It is also likely that the organisms living in these beach environments would have an increased risk of exposure to heavy PAHs trapped in the non-recoverable form of buried DWH oil spill residues.

The study focuses on low grade heat sources from a paper mill located on a British coastal area which presents a large quantity of recoverable waste heat at low temperature (<100 degrees C). Two scenarios are considered: (1) low grade heat is used directly to feed the desalination process, (ii) low grade heat is upgraded using a heat pump coupled with a desalination system.In the first scenario, a Humidification Dehumidification process was identified as a suitable technology due to its low operating temperature. In the second scenario, the low grade heat temperature was upgraded using a hybrid absorption heat pump and subsequently used to feed a Multiple Effect Distillation desalination system. These two cases were compared in terms of performances and economics. For both cases, a payback period of less than 10 years could be obtained for water price equal to 2 pound per tonnes of water. This is comparable to the price of home water supply. Environmental aspects were also discussed from the results of a full Lifecycle assessment. Low grade heat utilisation in both cases reduced the Global Warming Potential in comparison with fossil fuel powered systems, but toxicological impacts appeared higher in comparison to a system using natural gas.

Furthermore, a weathering-dependent increase of an operationally defined oxygenated fraction relative to the saturated and aromatic fractions was observed. This oxygenated fraction made up >50% of the mass of weathered samples, had an average carbon oxidation state of -1.0, and an average molecular formula of (C5H7O)(n). These oxygenated hydrocarbon residues were devoid of natural radiocarbon, confirming a fossil source and excluding contributions from recent photosynthate. The incorporation of oxygen into the oil's hydrocarbons, which we refer to as oxyhydrocarbons, was confirmed from the detection of hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups and the identification of long chain (C-10-C-32) carboxylic acids as well as alcohols. On the basis of the diagnostic ratios of alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and the context within which these samples were collected, we hypothesize that biodegradation and photooxidation share responsibility for the accumulation of oxygen in the oil residues.

To achieve environmental and economic sustainability, fuel production processes are required that are not only renewable, but also capable of sequestering atmospheric CO2. Currently, nearly all renewable energy sources (e.g. hydroelectric, solar, wind, tidal, geothermal) target the electricity market, while fuels make up a much larger share of the global energy demand (similar to 66%). Biofuels are therefore rapidly being developed. Second generation microalgal systems have the advantage that they can produce a wide range of feedstocks for the production of biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane and biohydrogen. Biodiesel is currently produced from oil synthesized by conventional fuel crops that harvest the sun's energy and store it as chemical energy. This presents a route for renewable and carbon-neutral fuel production. However, current supplies from oil crops and animal fats account for only approximately 0.3% of the current demand for transport fuels. Increasing biofuel production on arable land could have severe consequences for global food supply. In contrast, producing biodiesel from algae is widely regarded as one of the most efficient ways of generating biofuels and also appears to represent the only current renewable source of oil that could meet the global demand for transport fuels. The main advantages of second generation microalgal systems are that they: (1) Have a higher photon conversion efficiency (as evidenced by increased biomass yields per hectare): (2) Can be harvested batch-wise nearly all-year-round, providing a reliable and continuous supply of oil: (3) Can utilize salt and waste water streams, thereby greatly reducing freshwater use: (4) Can couple CO2-neutral fuel production with CO2 sequestration: (5) Produce non-toxic and highly biodegradable biofuels. Current limitations exist mainly in the harvesting process and in the supply of CO2 for high efficiency production.

A coflow reactor was developed to maximize CO2 hydrate production by injecting water droplets (e.g., similar to267 mum average diameter) from a capillary tube into liquid CO2. The droplets were injected in the mixing zone of the reactor where CO2 hydrate formed at the surface of the water droplets. The water-encased hydrate particles aggregated in the liquid CO2, producing a paste-like composite containing CO2 hydrate, liquid CO2, and water phases. This composite was extruded into ambient water from the coflow reactor as a coherent cylindrical mass, approximately 6 mm in diameter, which broke into pieces 5-10 cm long. Both modeling and experiments demonstrated that conversion from liquid CO2 to CO2 hydrate increased with water flow rate, ambient pressure, and residence time and decreased with CO2 flow rate. Increased mixing intensity, as expressed by the Reynolds number, enhanced the mass transfer and increased the conversion of liquid CO2 into CO2 hydrate. Using a plume model, we show that hydrate composite particles (for a CO2 loading of 1000 kg/s and 0.25 hydrate conversion) will dissolve and sink through a total depth of 350 m. This suggests significantly better CO2 dispersal and potentially reduced environmental impacts than would be possible by simply discharging positively buoyant liquid CO2 droplets.

Therefore, it is extremely important to communicate across disciplines. Of course, a physical reinterpretation is necessary and perhaps some modification of the methodology. This seems to be the situation in applying resource assessment methodologies as environmental are presented methodologies. In this paper, four petroleum resources assessment methodologies are presented as possible pollution assessment methodologies, even though petroleum as a resources is desirable, whereas pollution is undesirable. It is ironic that oil as a precious resource in the ground can become a serious pollutant as a spill in the ocean. There are similarities in both situations where the quality of undiscovered crude oil and natural gas resources, and the quality of a pollutant or contaminant are to be estimated. Obviously, we re interested in making a quantitive assessment in order to answer the question, ''How much material is there?'' For situations in which there are a lack of statistical data, risk analysis is used rather than classical statistical analysis. That is, a relatively subjective evaluation is made rather than an evaluation based on random sampling which may be impossible. Hence, probabilistic quantitative assessment methodologies are needed for the risk analysis.A methodology is defined in this paper to consist of a probability model and a probabilistic method, where the method is used to solve the model. The following four basic types of probability models are considered: (1) direct assessment, (2) accumulation size, (3) volumetric yield, and (4) reservoir engineering. Three of the four petroleum resources assessment methodologies were written as microcomputer systems, viz., TRIAGG for direct assessment, APPAS for accumulation size, and FASPU for reservoir engineering. A fourth microcomputer system termed PROBDIST supports the three assessment systems. TRIAGG is the simplesr assessment system, and therefore, more general in application. APRAS is more complex, and FASPU is the most complex. TRIGG and PROBDIST are completely generic, or general probability systems, in that they are not dependent on the physical context, only on the structure. Hence, they would require no modifications for pollution assessment application. APRAS would require some modification, and FASPU even more; however, many of the ideas of both would be applicable. The three assessment systems have different probability models but the same type of probabilistic method. The type of probabilistic method is analytic probability theory instead of Monte Carlo simulation. Among the advantages of the analytic method are its computational speed and flexibility, making it ideal for a microcomputer. All four OBM-PC compatible microcomputer systems are available from the U.S. Geological Survey Books and Open-File Reports Section.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0098-3004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1995-10-01,WOS:A1995TC68300007,,

The analyzed samples contain notable rich extracted bitumen, which is predominantly composed of NSO and asphaltene compounds and has lesser amounts of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons (HCs). The GC and GC-MS results for both saturated and aromatic HCs indicate that there are considerable variations among the samples, which are primarily attributed to the differences in the degree of biodegradation involving microbial activity. The sulfur content and its isotope values for the samples also support biodegradation. Three groups can be classified based on the biomarker distributions as follows: (1) in Group 1, C-19-C-25 tricyclic terpanes are most abundant, particularly the C-23 compounds; (2) Group 2 has no C-30-C-35 alpha beta hopanes and more abundant 25-norhopanes than the other two groups; and (3) Group 3 is similar to Group 1, but generally has less abundant C-19-C-25 tricyclic terpanes than Group 1. The reservoir alteration processes have notably influenced the biomarker properties of the samples. The most pronounced effects are the reduction of the amounts of C-30+ hopanes and increasing demethylated hopanes, particularly in Groups 1 and 2, but not in Group 3. For Group 3, unlike Group 1, the degradation of hopanes apparently does not result in demethylated hopanes, indicating that there is another pathway to produce hopanes and/or destroy demethylated hopanes. These findings indicate that the biodegradation processes that occurred in the Grosmont and Nisku Formations have been spatially and vertically varied due to the different environmental conditions and microbial processes.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1226-4806,1598-7477,,,,,,,,,,"Yonsei Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Seoul 03722, South KoreaChonnam Natl Univ, Dept Energy & Resources Engn, Gwangju 61186, South KoreaKorea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources, Petr & Marine Res Div, 124 Gwahak Ro, Daejeon 34132, South Korea",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000445385100005,,

From an extensive literature review, Brown and Westaway (2011) argue that community resilience, wellbeing, capacity, and capabilities inform agency, which in turn underlies different community responses to change. Further, it needs to be recognised that not everyone within a community is equally affected and groups of residents might perceive the community's response differently. To empirically examine the factors underlying five different perceptions of a community's response to change (resisting, not coping, only just coping, adapting, or transforming) a detailed telephone survey was conducted with 400 residents of the Western Downs region in Queensland, Australia, a rural area experiencing widespread changes in its social profile, economy, and landscape due to the rapid construction of unconventional gas infrastructure such as wells each kilometre, condensers, and pipelines. Most respondents thought the community was either adapting or only just coping with the changes. Two orthogonal factors underlay respondents' perceptions: community functioning and social engagement. Community functioning was by far the stronger factor and key aspects of community agency were reflected in four of community functioning's six dimensions: 1) community resilience actions such as planning and leadership, 2) collective efficacy, 3) community trust, and 4) inclusive decision making processes and citizen voice. High ratings of community functioning were associated with transforming followed by adapting, only just coping, resisting and not coping, in that order. Perceptions of the community's response were not predicted by demographic differences but the social engagement factor suggested that those with stronger social networks were more likely to think the community was not coping whereas those with weak social networks thought it was resisting, perhaps because they obtained their impressions from the Australian media which publicises public resistance to unconventional gas. The results support Brown and Westaway's analysis and also suggest that communities undergoing rapid change need support to be able to work with governments and industry and to facilitate key aspects of community agency.

The paper proposes the assessment of the environmental interventions resulting from the electrical energy production in Romania, a Central East European country, using the LCA technique limited to a Life Cycle Inventory study (an LCA without the Life Cycle Impact Assessment phase).Main Features. The following life cycles of the energy carriers employed in the production of the electrical energy are analysed according to their provenance: lignite (domestic) 31.2%, brown coal (domestic) 3.4%, brown coal (import) 0.4%, heavy oil (domestic, land) 4.2%, heavy oil (domestic, continental platform of the Black Sea) 0.4%, heavy oil (import) 3.6%, natural gas (domestic) 12.4%, natural gas (import) 6.1%, hydropower 27.8%, and nuclear energy 10.5% from the total of the electrical energy produced in Romania. The unit processes of the life cycles of these energy carriers are aggregated in two main stages: Pre-combustion (extraction, processing, transport and achievement of infrastructure) and Combustion (the production of electricity). The functional unit of the study is represented by 1 kwh. The spatial limits of the analysed system are extended as far as CIS countries for coal, Western Siberia (Russian Federation) for natural gas and the OPEC countries for oil. The temporal limits are included in the year 2000.Results and Discussion. The LCI study enabled us to quantify the interventions on the environment, which result from the electricity production in Romania, the independent use of different energy carriers and the different life cycle stages of the system. The use of the LCA technique in a prospective way shows the reduction of these interventions that could be achieved through the adoption of specific scenarios for the development of electrical energy production in the country.Conclusions. The main findings of this Life Cycle Inventory study, the first for Romania, are: the emissions of pollutant substances are prevailing in the combustion stage; for different energy carriers, the magnitude of environmental interventions decrease in the following order: coal, oil, natural gas, hydropower and nuclear energy. By comparison with other countries, the environment is more affected by the production of electricity in the case of Romania and only the promotion of alternative, renewable resources such as hydropower could substantially improve these interventions.Recommendations and Perspectives. Some important interactions with the environment, like land use or the risks of the nuclear energy, are not taken into consideration in the study because of the lack of particular data for Romania. We would like to continue the investigation in order to surpass the limits of the study, on the one hand by collecting data concerning the risk of nuclear power or land use at the national level for different energy carriers or, on the other hand, by taking into account some other renewable resources like wind or solar energy.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,5,0,11,,,0948-3349,,,,,,,,,,,"Environm Protect Agcy Iasi Cty, Iasi 700462, Romania",Environm Protect Agcy Iasi Cty,,,2007-06-01,WOS:000247446400005,,

An extensive research literature discusses the adverse impact of these trends on worker health and safety. Research has shown that economic pressures leading to unsafe practices by contractors, hazardous forms of disorganization in contracting chains and regulatory failure contribute to adverse health and safety outcomes for workers. Less research has addressed the impact of sub-contracting chains on the potential for complex catastrophic incidents in which the public could be impacted. We contribute to a growing body of work on this subject by examining excavation work around high pressure natural gas pipelines in Australia. We draw on past research complemented with concepts from the economics literature to highlight the impact of 'risk shifting' as contractors seek to cope with financial pressure in highly competitive sectors. Contract terms incentivize contractors to work as quickly as possible while also prioritizing compliance with safety-related rules. Using qualitative data from 36 face-to-face interviews we discuss the way that supply chains characterized by these types of contracts can lead to situations where the pressure to work quickly means that contractors might trade off safe work practices in order to meet project deadlines and make a profit. We argue that in times of acute financial pressure, safety can become fungible with an associated increase in risk to the public. The findings of this research may have broader implications for other public risk situations in sectors with similar structures and organizational arrangements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, individually, these metrics violate the principle of LCA known as comprehensiveness and do not necessarily provide an indication of overall environmental impact. In this study, the carbon footprints for six diverse beef cattle production systems in southern Australia were calculated and found to range from 10.1 to 12.7 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) live weight (cradle to farm gate). This compared to water footprints, which ranged from 3.3 to 221 L H(2)Oe kg(-1) live weight. For these systems, the life cycle impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water use were subsequently modelled using endpoint indicators and aggregated to enable comparison. In all cases, impacts from GHG emissions were most important, representing 93 to 99% of the combined scores. As such, the industry's existing priority of GHG emissions reduction is affirmed. In an attempt to balance the demands of comprehensiveness and simplicity, to achieve reliable public reporting of the environmental impacts of a large number of products across the economy, a multi-indicator approach based on combined midpoint and endpoint life cycle impact assessment modelling is proposed. For agri-food products, impacts from land use should also be included as tradeoffs between GHG emissions, water use and land use are common.",,,,,,,,,41,1,0,0,20,0,44,,,,2071-1050,,,,,,,,,,"CSIRO, Natl Res Flagship, Clayton, Vic 3169, AustraliaCSIRO Food & Nutrit Sci, Werribee, Vic 3030, AustraliaCSIRO Livestock Ind, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia",,,,2011-12-01,WOS:000208763900007,,

Multiple scenarios were evaluated through the application of a modified levelized cost of electricity (MLCOE), obtaining the overall thermoelectric generation cost in the country, given its specificities, the market, and other relevant issues. Moreover, the analysis of the produced data combined to an additional indicator, the levelized avoided cost of electricity (LACE), provides an extensive view of economic, environmental, and infrastructural aspects. The major modifications in the traditional LCOE methodology were the introduction of the cost of leakage in the natural gas production chain, the transmission costs, and the fuel prices analysis for the different technologies involved. Additionally, the recent discoveries of large gas reservoirs in the Brazilian ultra-deep waters, on the coast of Sao Paulo, the largest electricity market in South America, show a promising scenario, along with strategic investment and adequate policy, for a sustainable transition in the electricity mix of Brazil. This transition should occur through the use of natural gas-fired power stations, as part of strategic planning to avoid the shortage of electricity supply. In this context, results indicated that natural gas fired generators are very competitive and efficient, in both economic and environmental aspects, when compared to other thermoelectric technologies, even when externalities such as leakage, transmission, and carbon costs were considered. In addition, this study concluded that the natural gas leakage has the same impact as the CO2 emissions from combustion, when the percentage of leakage goes beyond 4.0% on a mass basis. Above this percentage, the impact of the CH4 leakage begins to surpass that of CO2, to a level in which natural gas becomes as greenhouse gas intensive as biomass. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

With good management, it can be used as a source of irrigation water and nutrients for a range of crops and soils under different climatic conditions and irrigation systems. However, there are few long-term studies of irrigation with treated sewage effluent in swelling soils such as Vertosols. This study was established in 2000 on a cotton farm near Narrabri, north-western New South Wales, to assess long-term (14-year) changes in soil salinity, sodicity and carbon storage in a self-mulching, medium-fine, grey Vertosol under conservation farming and furrow-irrigated with tertiarytreated sewage effluent and stored rainfall runoff. Experimental treatments in 2000-02 were gypsum applied at a rate of 2.5 t/ha in June 2000 and an untreated control. In 2003-13, the gypsum-treated plots received a single pass with a combined AerWay cultivator and sweeps to similar to 0.15m depth before sowing cotton; in the control plots, wheat stubble was undisturbed. By retaining significant amounts of crop residues on the soil surface, both practices are recognised as conservation farming methods. Parameters for water sampled from the head-ditch during each irrigation included electrical conductivity (ECw), pH(w), concentrations of cations potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+) and sodium (Na+), and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). Parameters for soil sampled to 0.6m depth before sowing cotton were pH (0.01M CaCl2), salinity (EC of 1 : 5 soil : water suspension), bulk density, soil organic carbon (SOC), exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and Na, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) and electrochemical stability index (ESI). SOC storage ('stocks') in any one depth was estimated as the product of bulk density, sampling depth interval and SOC concentration. Management system had little or no effect on cotton lint yields and the soil properties measured. Major changes in soil properties were driven by a combination of irrigation water quality and seasonal variations in weather. The cultivated treatment did not degrade soil quality compared with the control and may be an option to control herbicide-resistant weeds or volunteer Roundup-Ready cotton. Irrigation water was alkaline (average pH(w) 8.9), moderately saline (average ECw 1.0 dS/m) and potentially highly dispersive (average SAR 12.1). Long-term irrigation with tertiary-treated sewage effluent resulted in sodification (ESP > 6) at all depths, alkalinisation at 0-0.10 and 0.30-0.60 m, and accumulation in the surface 0.10m of Ca and K. Average ESP at 0-0.6m depth increased from 3.8 during 2000 to 13.2 during 2013. Sodification occurred within a few years of applying the effluent. Exchangeable Ca at 0-0.10m depth increased from 19 cmol(c)/kg during 2000 to 22 cmol(c)/kg during 2013, and exchangeable K from 1.5 cmol(c)/kg during 2000 to 2.1 cmol(c)/kg during 2013. Drought conditions caused an increase in salt accumulation, alleviated by a subsequent period of heavy rainfall and flooding. The reduction in salinity was accompanied by a fall in exchangeable Mg concentrations. Salinity and exchangeable Mg concentration were strongly influenced by interactions between seasonal rainfall (i.e. floods and drought) and the quality of the effluent, whereas ESP and exchangeable K concentration were not affected by variations in seasonal rainfall.SOC stocks declined until the flooding events but increased thereafter.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,1838-675X,1838-6768,,,,,,,,,,"Australian Cotton Res Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Narrabri, NSW 2390, AustraliaAustralian Natl Univ, Coll Med Biol & Environm, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Acton, ACT 2601, AustraliaPulse Australia, Wee Waa, NSW 2388, Australia",Pulse Australia,,,2016-11-16,WOS:000386122900007,,

The domestic emission control area (DECA) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China was selected as the target area for the study. The results suggest that the use of cleaner fuels is a promising way to improve air quality. For vessels sailing in the DECA, using 0.5% sulfur-content fuel could reduce SO2 and PM2.5 by 0.52 mu g/m(3) and 1.43 mu g/m(3), respectively, in the target cities of PRD, while 0.1% sulfur-content fuel could increase these figures to 0.59 mu g/m(3) and 1.62 mu g/m(3), respectively. The use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuel was predicted to be the most effective method for air quality improvement. LNG fuel could reduce the annual average concentrations of SO2, NO2 and PM2.5 by 0.63 mu g/m(3), 2.80 mu g/m(3) and 2.14 mu g/m(3), respectively, in the target cities of PRD.

These humidity levels affect combustion parameters in premixed combustion systems such as laminar burning velocity, adiabatic flame temperature, and pollutant emissions. The greatest effect of water in the reaction zone is the reduction of NOx formation (at equilibrium) by up to 40% through the thermal mechanism for lean mixtures. The laminar burning velocity is reduced by up to 25% at an equivalence ratio of 0.5 and a molar moisture content of 3.5%. This effect is reduced near the stoichiometric point due to the higher adiabatic flame temperature. The natural gas mixtures from the Cusiana and Guajira fields were analyzed. The same combustion property changes were obtained for both fuels when the reaction zone water content was varied. However, the Cusiana gas had a higher absolute flame temperature, laminar flame speed, and pollutant emissions than the Guajira gas, due to its greater heavy hydrocarbon content. This work presents the analysis and the resulting favorable-combustion map for the regions of Colombia. Therein is shown that Bogota and its surroundings are the most prone to NOx emissions due to the region's low atmospheric moisture content; less than 1.5% molar fraction. As a consequence, this area should implement tightened emissions monitoring and regulation. In contrast, the Atlantic coast and the Magdalena river valley are the regions of Colombia that have the best conditions for combustion due to their high moisture content; greater than 3.5% molar fraction. This makes them the preferred regions for the installation of combustion systems and thermal power generation plants from the point of view of minimizing operational instabilities and pollutant emissions. For example, at high pressure and temperature, the humidity has an appreciable effect on the laminar flame speed, reducing it by up to 25% at the equivalence ratio of 0.5.

The efficacy of the Soil CMS model has been tested for assessing soil organic carbon stocks in a selected climate-land-use-soil grouping (cell). The cell selected for this test represents an area of 709 683 ha and contains soils with a high-activity clay mineralogy promoting long-term stabilisation of organic matter, and is under low-producing grassland in a dry temperate New Zealand climate. These soils have been sampled at randomly selected positions to assess total soil organic carbon stocks to 0.3 m, and to compare with the modelled value. Results show no significant difference between the field estimation (67 +/- 30 MgC/ha), the mean value of the model calibration dataset (79 +/- 28 MgC/ha), and the value predicted by the model (101 +/- 41MgC/ha), although all estimates have large uncertainties associated with them. The model predicts national soil organic carbon stocks as a function of soil texture, clay mineralogy, land use, climate class, and a slope-rainfall erosivity product. Components of uncertainty within the model include the size and distribution of the calibration dataset, and lack of representativeness of the calibration soil samples, which were sampled for other reasons, e.g. soil survey and forest mensuration.Our study has shown that major components of uncertainty in our field estimation of soil organic carbon stocks (investigated using the indices reproducibility, RP; and coefficient of variation, CV) are short-range (within-plot) and regional (between-sites) spatial variability. Soil organic carbon stocks vary within our selected climate-land-use-soil cell due to varying stoniness (stony soils RP 44%, CV 21%; non-stony soils RP 27%, CV 13%), soil depth, slope position, and climatic effects. When one outlier soil was removed from the model calibration dataset, and the three very stony sites were removed from the randomly selected field validation set, the model calibration dataset and the field dataset means agreed well (78 +/- 26 and 78 +/- 21 MgC/ha, respectively). The higher modelled value, before removal of the outlier, is likely to reflect a bias in the model dataset towards conventionally selected modal profiles containing less stony soils than those encountered by the random sampling strategy of our field campaign. Therefore, our results indicate (1) that the Soil CMS provides an adequate estimation of soil organic carbon for the selected cell, and (2) ongoing refinements are required to reduce the uncertainty of prediction.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,14,0,21,,,1838-675X,1838-6768,,,,,,,,,,"Landcare Res, Manawatu Mail Ctr, Palmerston North 4442, New ZealandLandcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand",,,,2012-03-10,WOS:000300435000003,,

We used CenW 4.1, a process-based ecophysiological model, to run a range of scenarios to assess the effects of changes in management options, plant properties and environmental factors on SOC and milk production. We tested the model by using 2 years of observations of the exchanges of water and CO2 measured with an eddy covariance system on a dairy farm in New Zealand's Waikato region. We obtained excellent agreement between the model and observations, especially for evapotranspiration and net photosynthesis.For the scenario analysis, we found that SOC could be increased through supplying supplemental feed, increasing fertiliser application, or increasing water availability through irrigation on very dry sites, but SOC decreased again for larger increases in water availability. Soil warming strongly reduced SOC. For other changes in key properties, such as changes in soil water-holding capacity and plant root:shoot ratios, SOC changes were often negatively correlated with changes in milk production.The work showed that changes in SOC were determined by the complex interplay between (1) changes in net primary production; (2) the carbon fraction taken off-site through grazing; (3) carbon allocation within the system between labile and stabilised SOC; and (4) changes in SOC decomposition rates. There is a particularly important trade-off between carbon either being removed by grazing or remaining on site and available for SOC formation. Changes in SOC cannot be fully understood unless all four factors are considered together in an overall assessment. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Approximately 16% of the oil was chemically dispersed, at the surface and at 1500 m depth, using Corexit 9527 and Corexit 9500, which contain dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS) as a major surfactant component. This was the largest documented release of oil in history at substantial depth, and the first time large quantities of dispersant (0.77 million gallons of approximately 1.9 million gallons total) were applied to a subsurface oil plume. During two cruises in late May and early June, water samples were collected at the surface and at depth for DOSS analysis. Real-time fluorimetry data was used to infer the presence of oil components to select appropriate sampling depths. Samples were stored frozen and in the dark for approximately 6 months prior to analysis by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry with isotope-dilution quantification. The blank-limited method detection limit (0.25 mu g L-1) was substantially less than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) aquatic life benchmark of 40 mu g L-1. Concentrations of DOSS exceeding 200 mu g L-1 were observed in one surface sample near the well site; in subsurface samples DOSS did not exceed 40 mu g L-1. Although DOSS was present at high concentration in the immediate vicinity of the well where it was being continuously applied, a combination of biodegradation, photolysis, and dilution likely reduced persistence at concentrations exceeding the USEPA aquatic life benchmark beyond this immediate area.

However, ERT is rarely used at DNAPL sites due to the complexity of the DNAPL target coupled with the inherent limitations of traditional (surface and cross-hole) ERT configurations. Horizontal boreholes are being increasingly used in remedial strategies at contaminated field sites. This paper presents a novel surface-to-horizontal borehole (S2HB) ERT configuration for DNAPL site investigations. This array configuration is combined with four-dimensional (4D) inversion methods (applied on two-dimensional (2D) time-lapse monitoring datasets) to explore the potential benefit of S2HB ERT for mapping the spatial and temporal evolution of DNAPL mass during remediation. A field scale DNAPL remediation scenario was first simulated by a coupled DNAPL-ERT model. This demonstrated that S2HB ERT may provide significant improvements over surface ERT, particularly for delineating DNAPL mass removal at depth. A laboratory experiment was then performed to validate the S2HB ERT approach in a physical system. The experiment confirmed that 4D S2HB ERT provides improved time-lapse monitoring of NAPL changes. Confidence in the ERT responses obtained from the experiment was increased by direct comparison to-the actual distribution of NAPL mapped by excavation. Independent simulation of the experiment with the DNAPL-ERT model demonstrated that the model is reliable for simulating real systems. This initial study demonstrates significantly improved resistivity imaging with surface-to-horizontal borehole ERT and its potential as a non-destructive site characterization tool for mapping DNAPL mass changes during remediation.

We mapped AGB data (from 1986 to 2016) by combining the forest inventories and multisource remotely sensed data, including the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite data and Landsat dense time series imagery, and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) mosaic data in Guangdong, China. We used random forest (RF) and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) algorithms to determine the optimal variables of statistical models for mapping and validation of the AGB purpose. Our results showed that the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS)-based AGB correlated well (R-adj(2), = 0.89, n = 277, p < 0.001, RMSE = 21.24t/ha) with those obtained using the field-based method that used an RF-based approach, although inevitably, there is a saturation problem.

The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of mapping forests based on the PALSAR-forest/non-forest Landsat-based phenology for AGB masking were approximately 92.1% and 0.83, respectively.

There was an upward trend of total AGB among the four economic zones of Guangdong; the mountainous area had the highest AGB value distribution, accounting for 58%-70%, followed by the Pearl River Delta region (20%-30%), the western coast of Guangdong (3%-9%), and the eastern coast of Guangdong (2%-7%).

However, the situation characterizing these countries is far different from that of countries dependent on the import of fuels through maritime transportation, such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, because the dependence on fuel imports through maritime transportation affects not only the energy mix but also the complexity and results of WTW analysis. In addition, determining the WTW greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of driving BEVs in these countries is very important since these countries have large amounts of GHG emissions and strong interests in the widespread adoption of BEVs. Therefore, unlike previous studies, this study evaluates the WTW GHG emissions of BEVs in South Korea as an example of such countries. To perform WTW analysis of BEVs, comprehensive life cycle analyses of five power generation fuels (coal, natural gas, petroleum-based fuel, uranium, and bio heavy oil) are conducted. In addition, ten different power generation technologies and two different electric grids (mainland and the Jeju Island) in South Korea are analysed. The fuel economies of BEVs and conventional vehicles are also considered for evaluating the WTW GHG emissions. The result of this study shows that import processes commonly increase the life cycle GHG emissions of power generation fuels. The GHG emissions of natural gas from the upstream process are similar to 40% higher than those of the U.S due to the liquefaction and regasification required for importing natural gas. However, although natural gas produces large amounts of GHG emissions from the upstream process, the electricity generated from natural gas still produces the lowest GHG emissions among the fossil fuels like other countries due to the high efficiency of combined cycle systems. The life cycle GHG emissions of electricity of the Korean mainland and Jeju are calculated to be 578 g CO2 eq/kWh and 544 g CO2 eq/kWh, respectively, which are higher than that of the EU and lower than that of the U.S. and China. Driving BEVs in South Korea was found to have advantages of 90-110 g CO2 eq/lcm and 50-60 g CO2 eq/km on average over driving internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), respectively, not only on the Korean mainland but also on Jeju Island. Because the GHG emissions from the upstream process of major power generation fuels and the life cycle GHG emissions of the electricity from major power generation technologies are determined in this study, these results are expected to be informative for other countries, which may have different detailed generation mixes, in similar situations.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,3,0,31,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,,,,,,,"Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South KoreaSeoul Natl Univ, Inst Adv Machines & Design, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000448226600012,,

Using the electricity generation data from the US EIA (Electricity, electric power monthly, 2019d. ), and the renewable resource maps produced by NREL (Geospatial data science, 2018a. ; Geospatial data science, 2018b. ), we develop strategies for the states in the northern half of the USA. We group these states into seven regions: West Coast, Mountain States, Middle West States, Lake States, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, and New England states. For each region, we determine when and if the electricity generation from renewables will meet the region's electricity need while accounting for a 1% annual increase in electricity demand. The renewable resources included in our models are solar (rural, urban, and rooftop photovoltaic), wind (onshore), hydro, biomass, and geothermal which vary greatly from region to region. We also include nuclear, coal, natural gas, and petroleum. Our results show that the West Coast, Mountain, and Middle West regions have the potential to become 100% renewable in the years 2041, 2039, and 2038, respectively.

Type Pascual 1 was the most widely produced and the one that lasted longer among the amphorae used to transport Tarraconensis wine.In the framework of our recent research on inter-provincial maritime trade in the Early Roman Empire, we will present the results of the archaeometric study of 40 Pascual 1 amphorae from the two shipwrecks, aimed at identifying the workshops of origin within the Tarraconensis province. Provenance investigation was based on chemical analysis by XRF and thin section analysis. Besides, XRD and SEM-EDS analyses were also carried out in order to identify secondary mineral phases and alteration processes taking place during deposition in the maritime environment, which must be considered to establish valid chemical reference groups. The results have been compared with the large analytical database on amphora productions from many workshops of the Tarraconensis province available at the ERAAUB.The archaeometric study revealed that Pascual 1 amphorae from both shipwrecks were produced in specific workshops placed on the Central Catalan coast, near the main Roman cities of Baetulo (Badalona) and Iluro (Mataro).

This study was therefore conducted to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the effect of long-term CO2 exposure on the chemico-mineralogical structure and corresponding strength characteristics of saline aquifer rock formations using silicate cement (SS) and carbonate cement (CS) Hawkesbury sandstone samples collected from the Sydney basin. Sandstone samples were first reacted with brined+CO2 under different injection pressures (both sub-critical (4, 6 MPa) and super-critical (8, 10 MPa)) under a constant temperature of 35 degrees C. A comprehensive chemico-mineralogical analysis (ICP-AES and XRD) was first conducted on both the rock mass pore fluid and the rock matrix over the saturation period of one year, giving special attention to the alteration of dominant rock minerals (quartz, calcite and kaolinite). The overall influence after 12 months of saturation with brine and CO2 on the strength characteristics of the two types of sandstones (SS and CS) was then investigated and correlated with the chemico-mineralogical reaction, in order to understand the coupled process.According to the test results, compared to the silicate cement-dominant mineral structure (SS), the presence of a carbonate cement-dominant mineral structure (CS) in the aquifer rock formation creates more significant alterations in the formation's chemico-mineralogical structure upon CO2 injection. This is because calcite mineral reactions occur at much greater rates compared to quartz mineral reactions in CO2-exposed environments. In addition, although some minor precipitation of kaolinite minerals may also occur upon CO2 injection, the effect may not be significant. Overall, rock mineral changes in deep saline aquifers upon CO2 injection have a significant influence on the strength characteristics of the reservoir rock mass, depending on the aquifer mineral structure, and CS formations are subject to much greater strength property changes upon exposure to CO2 than SS formations. Interestingly, CO2 injection causes a strength gain in SS sandstone and a strength reduction in CS sandstone. These mechanical property alterations in aquifer rock formations are also dependent on the CO2 injection pressure and phase, and increasing the injecting CO2 pressure significantly enhances the changes, due to the highly acidic environment created by the enhanced CO2 solubility process. Changing the CO2 phase from sub-to super-critical condition also accelerates the reaction mechanisms, due to the greater chemical potential of super-critical CO2. However, overall SS sandstone exhibits more stable chemical-mineralogical and mechanical characteristics upon CO2 injection than CS sandstone, and exhibits more suitable characteristics for CO2 sequestration.

However, this lowers the concentration gradient between the atmosphere and other potential carbon reservoirs, such as the oceans, and thereby reduces the subsequent inherent rate of removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. Hence, storage of carbon in temporary reservoirs can reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the short term, but if the carbon is released again, it will increase concentrations in the long term. It must, therefore, be considered when, or, indeed whether, to store carbon in vegetation sinks. To determine an optimal strategy, the exact nature of climate-change impacts needs to be considered first. Impacts can be mediated by:1. the direct and instantaneous effect of CO2 and its associated temperature;2. the rate of change in CO2 and its associated temperature;3. the cumulative effect of CO2 and its associated temperature.Carbon stored in permanently maintained vegetation sinks can lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but this can be done most effectively if sequestration occurs close to the time when atmospheric concentrations are to be lowered. Similarly, maximal rates of change can be most effectively reduced by carbon sequestration close to the time of anticipated maximal rates of change. For reducing impacts via cumulative forcing, however, early sink activity would be more effective than delayed activity. Temporary carbon stores would only be beneficial for climate change impacts related to the cumulative impact of CO2, but it could even worsen impacts mediated via the instantaneous effect of temperature or those related to the rate of change. Hence, the planting of trees is only beneficial in reducing climate-change impacts if the most serious impacts are those related to the cumulative effect of increased temperature. If other impacts are more serious, then the planting of trees would bring greater benefits if it is delayed until closer to the time when the most severe impacts are to be expected. However, if serious land degradation would result from deforestation, or from a failure to plant trees in the near future, then trees should still be planted in order to maximise the amount of carbon stored on land.",,,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,21,0,53,,,0165-0009,,,,,,,,,,,"CSIRO Forestry & Forest Reprod, Kingston, ACT 2604, AustraliaCRC Greenhouse Accounting, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",CRC Greenhouse Accounting,,,2003-05-01,WOS:000182318900004,,

The cultural significance of such type of museum application is presented and discussed in the course of defining the term museographyIt is concluded that a significant attribute of archaeological resources exhibited in situ is never finished, a condition some museologists argue constrains displays in traditional museums.
